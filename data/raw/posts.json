Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.\n\nEven if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.\n\nIn my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.\n\nI actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.\n\nIs this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?\n",

There’s also a path here for data analysts to move into data science, which pays better and involves predictive analytics and advanced modeling.\n\nThat used to be my plan, but lately I’ve realized I’m not sure it’s for me. I’m autistic and I struggle with the constant presentations, storytelling, and meetings that come with more “business-facing” roles. I’m very introverted and prefer structured, predictable work and I’ve noticed the parts I enjoy most are the engineering ones: building pipelines, automating processes, making data flow efficiently.\n\nI don’t have a software engineering background (I’m a physicist), but I’ve always done well with computational work and Python. I haven’t worked with Spark, IaC, or devops yet, but I like that kind of technical challenge.\n\nI’m not looking for advice per se, just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone here has had a similar experience, moving from a data or analytics-heavy background into something more engineering-focused.",

I’d really appreciate your recommendations.

The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. \n\nOur pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. \n\nEverything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. \n\nIs this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place? My job is such that I feel even after hours or on weekends im thinking of all the things I have to do. When I log into work these days I feel so groggy. ",

        "author": "ThqXbs8",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Samara\nI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.\n\nThe idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.\n\n## What My Project Does\nYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:\n- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)\n- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)\n- Where the results should go\n- What to do when things succeed or fail\n\nSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.\n\n## Target Audience\n\n**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.\n**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.\n**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.\n\n## Current State\n- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)\n- Full type safety throughout\n- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)\n- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages\n- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams\n- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress\n\n## Looking for Contributors\nThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:\n- Extend Polars engine support\n- Build out transformation library\n- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and Databases\n\nCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)\n\nStar it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.\n\n---\nExample: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:\n\n```yaml\nworkflow:\n  id: product-cleanup-pipeline\n  description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data\n  enabled: true\n  \n  jobs:\n    - id: clean-products\n      description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data\n      enabled: true\n      engine_type: spark\n      \n      # Extract product data from CSV file\n      extracts:\n        - id: extract-products\n          extract_type: file\n          data_format: csv\n          location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/\n          method: batch\n          options:\n            delimiter: \",\"\n            header: true\n            inferSchema: false\n          schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json\n      \n      # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns\n      transforms:\n        - id: transform-clean-products\n          upstream_id: extract-products\n          options: {}\n          functions:\n            # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns\n            - function_type: dropDuplicates\n              arguments:\n                columns: []  # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates\n            \n            # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types\n            - function_type: cast\n              arguments:\n                columns:\n                  - column_name: price\n                    cast_type: double\n                  - column_name: stock_quantity\n                    cast_type: integer\n                  - column_name: is_available\n                    cast_type: boolean\n                  - column_name: last_updated\n                    cast_type: date\n            \n            # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output\n            - function_type: select\n              arguments:\n                columns:\n                  - product_id\n                  - product_name\n                  - category\n                  - price\n                  - stock_quantity\n                  - is_available\n      \n      # Load the cleaned data to output\n      loads:\n        - id: load-clean-products\n          upstream_id: transform-clean-products\n          load_type: file\n          data_format: csv\n          location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output\n          method: batch\n          mode: overwrite\n          options:\n            header: true\n          schema_export: \"\"\n      \n      # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle\n      hooks:\n        onStart: []\n        onFailure: []\n        onSuccess: []\n        onFinally: []\n```",

Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. \n\nThese REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details.  To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. \n\n* I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. \n* I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app.   \n* I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome.   \n\nIdeally, the standalone app would be just a \"drag to Applications folder, click to open, and leave running,\"  but there are so many onboarding steps to ensure correct configuration,  MCP server setup, Claude MCP config setup, etc., that non-technical users will get confused after step #5. \n\nHas anybody here built a similar ETL product that can be distributed as a standalone app to non-technical users?  Is there like a \"Docker for consumers\" type of solution? ",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI’m currently doing a Data Engineering internship (been around 3 months), and I’m honestly starting to question whether it’s worth continuing anymore.\n\nWhen I joined, I was super excited to learn real-world stuff — build data pipelines, understand architecture, and get proper mentorship from seniors. But the reality has been quite different.\n\nMost of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.\n\nFor example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.\n\nSame with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.\n\n\nI totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.\n\nNow I’m wondering:\nShould I stay another month and try to make the best of it,\nor resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?\n\nWould leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?\n\nHas anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?\nI’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.\n\nThanks",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.\n\nFor example, in my setup:\n\nPostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial data\n\nMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)\n\nDuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasets\n\nFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.\n\nHowever, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**\n\nIs it mostly about:\n\nMaintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?\n\n**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data. Big thanks! Ale**",

I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. \n1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). \n2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!\nThank you!",

Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. \n\nI’ll give you an example to follow.\nI have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. \nNow some changes may appear in this operational table\n\n1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance\n2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example).  Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data\n3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. \n4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC\n5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing \n\nDid you encounter similar issues in your development? How did you tackle it?\n\nAlso, if you have any advices that you want to share related to your experience with CDC, it will be more than welcomed. \n\nThanks, and sorry for the long post\n\nNote: I use Sql Server",

All on the starter subscription.\n\nThen, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.\n\nWe are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!\n\nOk, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.\n\nWe already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.\n\nAnd to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.\n\nIs segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification? Is the only viable option self-hosting OSS or creating something yourself at this point?\n\nAnd what are you guys using?

We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.\n\nBut we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  \n\nFor the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.\n\nWith either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshift\n\nWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \n\n\\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term.  \n\\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance  \n\\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.\n\nI'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it.  \nOn Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a query\n\nQuestion:\n\n1.

We have a pretty robust architecture in place, but looking to possibly simplify things a bit especially for new engineers.\n\nWe are currently using SnowDDL + some custom tools to handle or Snowflake Schema Change Management. This gives us a hybrid approach of imperative and declarative migrations. This works really well for our team, and give us very fined grain control over our database objects.\n\nI’m trying to figure out the right separation of responsibilities between dbt and an external DDL tool:\n- Is it recommended or safe to let something like SnowDDL/Atlas manage Snowflake objects, and only use dbt as the transformation tool to update and insert records?\n- How do you prevent dbt from dropping or replacing tables it didn’t create (so you don’t lose grants, sequences, metadata, etc…)?\n\nWould love to hear how other teams draw the line between:\n- DDL / schema versioning (SnowDDL, Atlas, Terraform, etc.)\n- Transformation logic / data lineage (dbt)\n",

        "author": "poogast",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.\n\nMy Goal:\nI want a containerized setup where:\n\n1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.\n2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).\n3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.\n4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.\n\nMy Current Architecture & Problem:\n\nI have the following containers working mostly independently:\n\n· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).\n· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.\n· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.\n· grafana: Connected to Trino.\n\nThe missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).\n\nThis is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.\n\nWhat I've Tried/Researched:\n\n· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.\n· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.\n· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.\n· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.\n\nMy Specific Question:\n\nIs the \"Hive Metastore in a container\" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.\n\n1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.\n2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?\n3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?\n\nAny advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!\n\nThanks in advance.",

If anyone had this battle before, please advice.\n\nFor context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.\n\nI use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.\n\nCurrently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.\n\nThere is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.\n\nMy idea: \n\nStep 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.\n\nStep 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the \"reporting\" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization only\n\nMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.\n\nMy points to go for step 2:\n- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)\n- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance\n- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed\n- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)\n- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased \n\nAnything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",

Don't know why though, I'd love to understand (especially when I duplicated that folder). PS, both workspaces are under unity catalog. Ps2: I'm not Databricks expert, so any help is welcome. We need to migrate years of historical data, and also might need to remigrate when new data is added. So incremental unloading is needed as well... I don't know if delta sharing is an option or would be too expensive, since we need just to copy all that history, I read there's cloning too but don't know if that's cross metastore/cloud possible...too much info, if someone migrated or you have ideas, thank you!",

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. \n\nRight now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.\n\nI guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be? I worked up a dashboard prototype using Chat GPT that I’d love to get some feedback on, if I get any interest on this post. I’d love to hear thoughts from people who work in this field!

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. \nThere is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.\n\nHere’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.\n\nThe process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:\nI would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.\n\nI would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.\n\nI tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.\n\nIn theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.\n\nSo here what I am wondering:\n\nHas anyone built something similar?\nDoes this approach scale?\nAre there proven practice for this that I might be missing?\n\nSo yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",

A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. \n\nTurns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. \n\nI searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. \n\nNow, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\n\n\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance  \n\\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector  \n\\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy  \n\\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them  \n\\- Directions for even further optimizations and learning\n\nHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search! \n\n[https://www.clarvo.ai/blog/optimizing-filtered-vector-queries-from-tens-of-seconds-to-single-digit-milliseconds-in-postgresql](https://www.clarvo.ai/blog/optimizing-filtered-vector-queries-from-tens-of-seconds-to-single-digit-milliseconds-in-postgresql)\n\nLet me know if there is anything I missed or if you have come up with better strategies!",

Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.\n\nI thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.\n\nHowever, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:\n\nIt’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.\n\nSmaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.\n\nLarger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.\n\n\nTheir suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.\n\nThat makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.\n\nHas anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?\n\nHow did you position yourself for it?\n\nAre there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?\n\nAnd lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?\n\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice.\n\nThanks in advance!",

In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.\n\nAnd now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo. However, I don't know I how to convert .py to .ipynb to locally develop my notebook. And after that how to convert .ipynb back to .py to push it to repo. I don't want to keep .ipynb and .py in remote repo. I just need the update, final .py version in repo. I can't right-click on .py file in repo and switch to .ipynb somehow. I can't do anyhting.\n\nSo the **best-practice workflow** for me (and I guess for other data engineers) is:\n\nWork interactively in `.ipynb` → convert/sync to `.py` → commit `.py` to Git.\n\nI read that some use jupytext library:\n\n`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:light notebooks/my_notebook.py`\n\nbut don't know if it's the common practice. What's the best approach? Could you share your experience?",

And every single job requires something drastically different.\n\nI dont really know how its possible. I have 3 YOE and spend most of my free time working with c++ to keep my knowledge up to date. In terms of technology, i have a very good understanding of DSP but thats about it. I cant imagine learning two or three additional leanguages to a very good level, as well as other technologies, and becoming proficient in each of them.\n\nAre people simply outstanding and know everything, or is their knowledge (and expected knowledge in job) is based on \"i heaard something, i read something, thats all, rest i will learn at job\"?",

I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",

I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.\n\nI'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I finally caved and tried a split keyboard (NocFree lite, wireless version). Been two weeks and my wrists already feel a lot less strained during long coding sessions. My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices.  \n  \nThe layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing.  \n  \nBeyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys. I can even remap keys to control the mouse which is quite handy for my workflow (like scrolling or navigating code without leaving the keyboard). Hot-swappable switches mean I can tweak the typing feel over time without having to replace the whole board so I like the long-term use I’ll get out of it.  \n  \nOverall it has been a small change that’s actually improved my learning speed. Sharing it here for anyone curious about split boards. Those who already use one, how long did it take you to get used to the layout?",

I've tried writing my own factorial function, but I keep getting stack overflow errors, and I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.\n\n\n\nWhat strategies do you use when you're stuck on a concept like this? Are there any particular resources or mental models that helped recursion click for you?",

I feel like they only focus on finishing projects fast, and there is not much chance to grow in my career here.\n\nMy dream is to work for the best tech companies in Bangladesh and maybe for big tech companies around the world. At university, I spent time coding  sometimes doing competitive programming, sometimes building apps or websites. But I never became an expert at anything. Maybe four years is too short, especially because one year was online because of COVID.\n\nI learned C++, Django, React, and React Native. I can learn new languages and frameworks quickly. Still, I think I could be better if I worked harder on problem solving and development.\n\nNow, I am confused. I don’t know what to focus on to get my dream. Sometimes I think I should do more competitive programming to get better at data structures and algorithms. Other times, I think learning MERN stack or backend frameworks like .NET or Spring Boot is better. I also wonder if learning languages like C# or Java is useful.\n\nThere is so much information and many choices. I spent many hours thinking but I am still stuck.",

But I feel inadequate...\n\nAlthough I know how to code, I feel like my lack of experience is killing me. I have \"created\" several projects on my own in my own time. A video game in GameMaker Studio, a JavaScript/HTML based NFL Trivia Website, and a Python based NFL Prediction program that uses Pandas to collect data... \n\nAlthough I \"created\" those projects, I gotta admit... They weren't created off the top of the ol' dome. The best way I can explain them is that they were put together with duct tape and bubble gum haha. Whenever I need help with a specific portion, i'd just google the question I had, use code from different forums and tutorials, and edit that code it to fit my specific needs. Like I have no idea how to just free-hand use Pandas for my NFL Algorithm. There is countless hours of googling and taking code to be able to make it happen. I don't know how to just free-hand create an HTML site lol. I just used the code that we learned in a project in school and edited to fit my ideas...\n\nI feel like an idiot for that. I guess the best solution is to just keep practicing... but for right now, I just feel like a fraud for not knowing all the intricacies of the languages I use. I am actively looking for entry-level jobs, especially because I have experience in the industy as an Engineering Technician that exposed me to the code that software engineers wrote... But I feel like my first interview (assuming I get that far) is going to be a disaster and i'll get made out to be a fraud...\n\nHas anyone else felt this level of Imposter Syndrome?",

I am now responsible for building an MS Access Reporting tool and using Excel, SQL, and VBA, and documenting our existing codebase for our \"applications\".\n\nWhile I enjoy my work, I recognize that working with VBA isn't what programming looks like in the typical sense of the word. I don't record macros, but there's a lot of abstraction in VBA and I feel like it's quite different from in depth programming work people do in python and other languages. I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues. I feel like I might like \"scripting\" instead of \"programming\", but I'm not even sure how to define the difference between the two, apart from how programming involves more technical memory allocation while \"scripting\" is the surface level \"do this do that\" of programming.\n\n  \nTL;DR: Do I like programming or scripting? And if I like scripting, what does that mean for my self-education journey (I'm currently re-introducing myself to Python)?\n\n",

        "content": "Context: As part of my self-study routine, alongside reading \\*The Algorithm Design Manual\\* by Skiena, I practice LeetCode problems. I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).\n\nI’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.\n\nWhen I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\n\n\\* Backtracking\n\n\\* Dynamic Programming\n\n\\* Memoization\n\nI can also identify the problem category:\n\n\\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\n\n\\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\n\n\\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)\n\nI’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best. I’d like to hear about your experiences and any advice that helped you overcome similar difficulties. Thanks!",

It makes the learning very concrete and tangible. In that way it's a bit easier to \"keep going\" with it as you learn more.\n\nBut if you're interested in something like how computers work, while it's cool in a mystical sort of sense, or from the perspective of curiosity, it's hard to have a real-world application for it. That lack of real-world application makes it hard to feel like there's goals and a path to follow, and it's easy to feel like you don't have a way to practice what you're learning.\n\nI guess put another way, there's some programming/computer concepts that are inherently practical, and some that feel theoretical. How do you find practical applications for the areas that are more theoretical to reinforce what you're learning?",

I'm a Junior Dev working mainly with Python.\n\nI've been asked to write a series of unit tests for a feature that I'm implementing on a project that I've worked on for a couple of months already.\n\nTo give some context. It's a microservice using a company-developed ORM. Each microservice inherit from a base class with a series of functionalities and the ORM itself. These microservices communicate with each other through a message broker.\n\nI need to write tests mainly for business logic and the ORM-related service layer queries. I’ve never written tests before, so I’ve been reading documentation and watching tutorials but most of the material I find is too basic and not fit for what I need.\n\nI've managed to write most of the tests for the business logic part, but I find it quite hard to do so for the ORM queries.\n\nThe main issue I'm facing is understanding how to effectively test ORM queries. Most examples I see online suggest using mocks with predefined return values, but I don’t really see the value in that.  \nIf I mock everything, I’m basically faking entire functionalities. So if after adding a new feature or refactoring code were to break, these tests would not detect it. So what am I testing?\n\nI feel like I'm testing the same things that I'm writing which doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI'd really appreciate some help on this. Thanks in advance! :)",

I've got a few ideas for some personal projects, but I'm a bit stuck on where to start. I don't feel as though starting from scratch with Codecademy or OdinProject will be right as I still know enough to read JS and understand how things work. It's more about how it all fits together and starting from scratch that I feel daunting.\n\nWhat would be your advice? I'm looking at eventually getting back into a junior web development or 6 role. \n\nI'm leaning towards smaller little fun projects that have some complexity as a starting point so I don't get bored churning through tutorials on stuff I feel I already know.\n\nThe one thing I picked back up very quickly was version control and Git, so I have that ticked off already.\n\nLanguages I want to focus on are JS/TS and React (previously developed production level apps in VUE).\n\n\n**Edit** \n\nAlso interested in branching out to Python, running through the Mission Python book to create a game and then rewriting it, changing it about, and making my own project from that.\n\nWould it be detrimental to branch out and figure out exactly where my passion with coding sits?",

It adds up to **1,403 cuts statewide** — it’s unclear how the overall cuts might be affecting subsidiaries. (Amazon also owns Audible, Twitch, Goodreads, Whole Foods, Zoox and Ring.)\n\nWho are these laid-off workers? **Software development engineers make up the largest category, with hundreds of cuts listed across the documents**. Amazon is also shedding recruiters, business analysts, marketers and managers. The layoffs in Irvine and San Diego, where Amazon has video game studios, include dozens of game designers and game artists.\n\nThis sheds some light on how affected SWEs were by this layoff in California at least.

His heart starts racing every time his phone buzzes, thinking it might be that email. The \"you’ve been impacted\" one.\n\nHe barely sleeps..maybe 2 or 3 hours a night.\nHe told me people who got laid off earlier received their emails after midnight or early morning, so now he stays awake in constant fear of that notification. Imagine being that scared of an email.\n\nHe keeps saying \"I'm sure I'll be next. They like people who talk a lot. I just…..work.\"\nAnd the sad part...he’s really good at his job. But his manager once told him that his communication skills are a little off and he needs to work on that. He was okay with this initially and agreed to work on it but with the constant state of fear and overthinking he thinks this could be one of the deciding factor.\nThere are some new hires in his team..they’re young, confident, articulate..and he feels invisible next to them and assumes he’s automatically at risk.\n\nIt’s heartbreaking to see someone who’s great at what they do be this mentally wrecked by uncertainty. The kind of fear that turns your phone into an anxiety trigger.\nThese corporates don’t talk enough about what layoffs or even the fear of layoffs do to people mentally. It’s brutal.

Stripe is going to force me to work Hybrid.   \nThis is a massive lifestyle change I was not anticipating. It is a 1h20m commute via train into Toronto. \n\nI have been thinking about the possibility of receiving an offer for Hybrid work and genuinely I cannot decide if it would be worth it... going over some pros/cons:\n\nPros:  \n\\- \\*Big pay increase (140k All salary-> \\~250k TC)  \n\\* Unsure about pay change after tax.. RSUs in Canada are taxed insanely  \n\\- Huge name on my resume  \n\\- Chance to learn some of the best software practices and learn from very smart people\n\nCons:  \n\\- Will likely have no WLB (from what I read online.. Stripe has the full PIP and stack rank culture)  \n\\- I feel like I am pretty much guaranteed to get burnt out within 1-2years  \n\\- Stock packages given as RSUs in Canada, which are taxed at 50% IIRC ... the increase in comp may not be as big as it would seem? \n\n\\---  \n  \nI would love some opinions. I am leaning to thinking it might not be worth it since I could only see myself there for something like 1.5-2yrs.\n\nI cannot decide if I should say YOLO and accept the offer for the overall experience... or if I should accept my current solid position and not F with my solid setup.

On top of this, I need to help ppl with their coding, like PR review, daily discussions, and so on. And then I also get into Production calls, reviewing production outcomes, why our code isn't performing well or whatever, etc. \n\nI fucking hate all of this. It might sound easy due to not coding, but i need to stretch my brain in a way that just gets me very overwhelmed, while also being incredibly BORED.\n\nI just never imagined that, I would be coding less, while being 5x more stressed than ever. A lot of the requirement documents I review are poorly written, so I have to keep scheduling meetings / following up with ppl to ask questions.. my day sometimes is just meetings ALL day, with almost no time to eat a damn meal. \n\nAnd then I need time to do code review so my team members' aren't blocked! So oftentimes, I do the code review at like 7pm after dinner or early in the morning the next day. \n\nShit's fucked. Anyway, just a dumb rant I guess. \n\nIt just makes me sad that, this is ultimately where a SWE goes. You can't be that guy being told what to do all the time.. now I need to take accountability for things and be the one to tell others what to do. But it's just so.. overwhelming man. Sigh.",

So idk if they just want cracked folks or I just fucked up\n\nI went through an interview process with a very small startup (less than 10 employees) in an industry I am new to. The interviews seemed to go really well. During the process, they mentioned there would be an initial probationary period of a few months, after which I’d need to relocate if both sides wanted to continue. They even had meetings with my references on top of the interview process.\n\nThe work is quite challenging and requires a strong understanding of cloud, networking, security, and a modern tech stack. They didn’t provide health insurance, but in our meeting they initially said they would pay for the cost if I purchased it myself. I received a non-formal offer via email sharing the good news and to discuss terms. Later, in the informal offer email, they claimed the quoted salary already factored in health insurance cost they claimed they'd imburse.\n\nBecause of my medical expenses and insurance needs, I asked humbly if there was any flexibility for a $10K increase in base salary, phrasing it as:\n\n*\"On base salary, I was hoping to see if there’s any flexibility toward $x\"*\n\nThe next day, I noticed my LinkedIn notification showed my resume had been viewed/downloaded again for that job I applied 2 weeks back. Then I received this email:\n\n*\"While working to finalize this, the founding team decided to take hiring for this position in a different direction. I realize this is not the answer you were anticipating, but want to get you a response as soon as possible to help guide your search process.\"*\n\nIn this tough market, where getting a job is extremely hard and I had submitted over 2,000 applications, I finally received an offer (not an official letter, just terms via email), and now it feels like I’ve lost the one opportunity I had.\n\nI’m wondering if they rejected me because of the $10K request, and if it’s normal for a company to back out this way during negotiations. I understand some companies have tight budgets, but isn’t the usual approach to say, “this is what we can provide” or “we can’t meet your proposal”?\n\nPart of me wants to believe they found a more senior candidate and it wasn’t my fault, but another part worries that I messed up by asking for more.\n\nWhat do you guys think could be what happened.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm an ML Engineer with 6 YoE and a PhD for ML in Applied Math, based in the US. I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to \"unlimited\" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.\n\nFor the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.\n\nJust for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of \"R&D\" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.\n\nBut whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had \"unlimited\" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.\n\nEveryone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.\n\nAny advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad. Beyond that, if anyone has experience with this I'd like to hear about it so I can understand what to do / not to do.",

        "content": "Graduated this May in CS. Did a bootcamp placement program which led to this startup role as an \"AI Dev.\" They labelled it as a senior role (despite me being a new grad) and emphasized using tools like Cursor and Chat as part of the workflow, which the company paid for. This was my first post-grad job.\n\nGot pulled aside this morning and was told \"today's your last day here,\" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting \"velocity,\" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.\n\nWas told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters. There seemed to be conflicting expectations between moving fast vs initial code quality between two of my authorities, and I often had difficulty getting timely support or permissions from the dev team.\n\nI'd love some advice moving forwards. I just relocated across the country for this job and have pretty limited savings and a year's lease to pay. The company offered a release agreement with small severance.\n\nI'm also not the first person to be let go from this role; another person was let go under a month ago for similar vague reasoning he also wasn't aware of. In any case, how might I proceed from here? Any hope for a new grad at this point in time?\n\nThank you!",

I was already on the verge of burning out because I was on track for promo but \"because of org changes we don't know when exactly it'll happen\"\n\nSo I've started applying for internal positions well before this event but now with this news I got a decent severance package and due to my accrued PTO+ Years spent in this firm, i think overall I'll get almost 6months of pay. \n\nNow, i also have an option to pursue an internal position in an adjacent team which is basically a 1:1 mapping of my current role and I know that team works a lot and the work over there is mehh or at least not that interests me long term but also likely not be able to prep for interviews due to the expectations. \n\nI can basically pull some strings and have high confidence i can get that offer, but if they offer and regardless of whether i accept or reject i'll loose this severance package. \n\nIt's clear to me that 6month pay is much better than this internal position but i'm on H1b and have until March 2026 to find a job. if not I'm screwed or i'll have to think about changing to B1/B2 to buy time or joining a consulting firm which i want to avoid. \n\nWith this job market and all this VISA bs i'm not really sure if i can find a new job within March, but the thought of 6month severance without doing any work seems really sweet to recover mentally and get on the leetcode grind. \n\nWhat do you think is the better play? should i just pull my internal applications and get out with severance and try my luck outside? (Somewhat confident i'll find something in 6 months). Or take that internal position and be safe, loose that sweet severance work for some time and switch with position of power? \n\nI personally want to take severance but with this VISA limbo i'm super confused about what's better. \n\n  \nReally appreciate all your help/advice here. \n\n",

I’m assessing the potential damage on my learning trajectory and well… i dunno. I feel like I’m just reinforcing my fraud status. \n\nI know that this is a stupid gripe to have especially when i’m lucky to even have a job.

Thus, I’ve gone back to school to give it another chance with the hopes to make good/decent money post-grad. I’m currently taking an intro to programming/scripting class which has been going ok, the thing is I’m just not sure if I love it yet. My true passion is travel, and I figured if I studied CS I could get a well paying job and potentially be able to work remotely whilst traveling in the future. But now I’m really second guessing everything considering how poor the job market for CS grads seem to be at the moment. So, am I making a mistake for continuing this path? Should I consider studying something else, or even just drop out again and see where life takes me? I’m also currently living with my parents and hate the state I live in (US), so the thought of being stuck here for another 3-4 years sounds miserable, but if I could set myself up for a good future I feel it’d be worth it.

I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like \"My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now.\" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.\n\nWhen you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring?

        "content": "I graduated in 2023 and spent a grueling 8 months job hunting before I landed my current position as a software engineer at a FAANG company. I've been there ~1.5 years now, and at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. Everyone on my team is kind, my manager is very supportive, and while WLB was rough, I thought I could manage it. \n\nI could care less about the work that I'm doing too, but that's probably the case for most people anyway. \n\nIn the beginning, I was performing well and received a promotion at the 1 year mark, but since then, it feels like my performance has quickly gone downhill. I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. \n\nI completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.\n\nAnd it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating. It's gotten so bad that I've been daydreaming about when I  worked retail jobs on night shifts during college (legitimately think that was more enjoyable for me than this job). \n\nI don't know if I'm just not built for a corporate job. The tight deadlines, horrible WLB, constant comparisons with coworkers, etc. All of it has been causing me so much stress, and my health has gone to hell this year because of it I think. Several days this month, I've just stared at my laptop screen, feeling like I physically could not do any work that day. \n\nI'm really frustrated with myself, because I grew up pretty poor and I think, if 12yo me knew I was complaining this much about a job paying me six figures, I'd punch myself in the face. \n\nI'm hoping I can get some advice from people who've felt similar:\n1. Am I just depressed or is my job really not a good fit for me? \n2. Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?\n3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? \n4. Also, can someone reassure me that moving to the middle of nowhere and becoming a hermit isn't actually a valid solution?",

I've even been applying to positions I'm technically overqualified for, experience-wise. I've applied to hundreds of companies at this point, and I've heard back from only a handful of them, both to set up an interview and to let me know they're moving forward with other candidates. It seriously feels like there is a 5% or less chance of actually getting any sort of response. At this point I'm not really sure what to do.\n\nI've been debating on returning to school to pursue a second degree in data science, as it seems to be the most relevant field of business pertaining to comp sci. There's a solid chance of me getting into the school I want, and there are a couple of scholarships I could apply for to help me out tuition-wise, plus I'd already have some credits done (mostly gen-ed) from my previous degree. **I guess I'm writing to ask what others in this same position are doing or thinking with the current state of the C.S. economy in the US.** It feels like a degree in C.S. just leads you to a dead-end road, and I don't know if it's worth sticking to at this point.",

        "content": "Hello, I am currently in my senior year of my CS degree, and have a rather hard decision to make. Last summer, I accepted an internship at  a non-tech company working as a full stack intern. The company is great, people are nice, pay for my area is pretty good, etc. I was offered to continue my internship part time through the school year and have continued working there ever since. Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where  I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. \n\nSide note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles. ",

Yesterday I found a bug and figured out the root cause and fix in minutes — but then spent the entire day figuring out how to implement it in SnapLogic.

        "content": "I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFor context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".\n> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThere were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a new grad hire at a tech company (FAANG-level but not quite), about 3 months in after a 6-month internship. And honestly… I’m at a loss.\n\nThe tech skills required at my job are entirely different from what we learned in college. The learning curve feels almost vertical. Every single day I discover something new (and usually critical) about the application I’m supposed to be developing — it’s overwhelming.\n\nI have a two-part question:\n\nHow can I become a better developer?\nI’ve learned a lot already, but I feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. The deadline pressure is insane, and it’s hard to balance learning deeply vs. just finishing the task. I want to focus on writing clean, well-structured code and truly understanding what I’m building, but the pace doesn’t allow it. Any tips on handling this phase better?\n\nHow do I know if I’m truly passionate about this field?\nBack in high school, I loved math and physics — genuinely. But I was sort of pushed into CS by my father. I don’t know if I regret it, because it’s given me a stable career path and I do enjoy Leetcode/problem-solving. But when it comes to actual software development — especially the kind that involves tons of domain/context-specific knowledge — I often feel lost and frustrated.",

        "content": "I have been in my current position for about a year, and it's my first job out of college. I am the only 'dev' on the team. I don't have a senior, but there are a couple people doing dev works on different teams in the same building. \n\nMost of my work has felt like toy projects. I have mainly been responsible for tool development and data processing. Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).\n\nIt all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. \n\nThe point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff). I'm worried that I'm 'poisoning the well' by getting light dev experience without any guide. I am worried that I will essentially still be entry level as long as I stay here.

The recruiter said it’d be best to brush up on these and that “_They will likely ask about your skill sets in those areas and how you would deal with common problems that are encountered in Azure and Postgres_”. I get it, they don’t want an engineer that might struggle adapting to their environment. I am not worried I’d have trouble picking these up, I’m just worried about this next stage of discussion. \n\nMy issue is that there is *so* much to study in just a couple of days. *What are some common problems in your experience?

What's the stance on making such repos public with this info?\n\n\nContext: I have ~5 YOE already so maybe showing my GitHub to a prospective employer doesn't matter, but I've been working on a tool for the past week to learn about what goes into it and yesterday decided to just use Claude Code for faster development while still reading through diffs and being meticulous.\n\nOn the one hand, as far as this tool's development goes, it's something that I want to have at my disposal for my own reasons, and learning about what goes into its development is something I want. So, I don't really care if a HM or whatever doesn't like what they see. That being said, would it be bad in this day and age to just have a repo with many large, quick commits that indicate the obvious use of an AI tool? One the one hand, \"he's vibe-coding and can't do this without AI\", on the other hand, it shows I can use modern tools to quickly deliver something.",

Some worked for \"famous\" companies, even got some with titles shouldn't apply to our job.\n\nMy team has been trying to hire people since a few months ago. We first were looking for candidates who know the tech stack. We got bunch of resumes from the consulting companies that mentioned they have worked on the tech stack, and they all have at least 7+ years of experience ( in general), but literally none of them passed our two round interview. \n\nThe first one is questions about some basic knowledge ( basic if you've worked on the tech stack, in my opinion ), and questions about how the candidates would solve a problem.\n\nThe second round is a coding challenge while sharing the screen (like pair programming where we might give some hints) that only takes about 90 mins. The features we asked them to do are really basic if they have worked on the tech stack before, and we also allowed them to google and check the documentation if they want, it really is an open book exam, but just no AI stuff. 90 mins is really more than enough to complete.\n\nNone of them passed. We decided to look for candidates who know a different tech stack that I think is more well known compared to the first one, but also to focus on how they solve problems, like the approach they take, how they are solving it, and etc. Guess what, literally only 2 of them passed and they aren't really the devs we are looking for, we only hired them because we realized they know a tech stack well enough and seems to be alright when it comes to learning new things.\n\nWe have interviewed more than 40 people already.

I have a bachelor of science in an unrelated major and I was accepted into a Masters program at an online university Concordia University in Austin Texas. I’m having difficulty finding any students of the program and a quick search on LinkedIn found very little software engineers from that university.\n\nHowever, I chose it because it was the lease restrictive on its leveling course requirement, which would save me a year or two compared to other programs where it would take around five years including leveling courses vs versus 2 to 3 years at Concordia. I am getting tuition paid so that is not a concern.\n\nI have done Web Dev on my own time and made a To-Do program using react and all the basic building blocks before that in terms of technical skills, about 1 year of self learning experience. I have no education in computer science, and so I thought this message would at least show employers that I am worth hiring. \n\nWould it be a bad idea to do this masters program? I was thinking that while I’m doing the program that could provide some leverage in addition with my projects to get hired at an entry level role. And I’m hoping that it will give me a higher starting rate. I know the market is bad right now, but my timeline is about one to two years.\n\n",

My question is: how can I prove myself at work and make them rely on me more?\n\nTo be fair, I did make some mistakes at the beginning, but that’s normal for anyone doing something for the first time. I’ve noticed that even before she got transferred, whenever I got assigned something, they’d tell me to ask her for help. She’s great at what she does, always asks the right questions, and when our manager comes around and talks to us, he usually makes eye contact with her — like he expects her to be the one answering.\n\nHonestly, I do feel a bit jealous sometimes. But I always follow that feeling with a prayer for her success and mine too. What makes me sad is that I spend eight hours at work with barely anything to do, while she’s always busy and people constantly come to her. It frustrates me a little because I feel like I’m just there doing nothing.",
