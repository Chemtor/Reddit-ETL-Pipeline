        "content": "Lately I’ve been wondering: is the title “Data Engineer” starting to lose its meaning?\n\nThis isn’t a complaint or a gatekeeping rant—I love how accessible the tech industry has become. Bootcamps, online resources, and community content have opened doors for so many people. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel that the role is being diluted.\n\nWhat once required a solid foundation in Computer Science—data structures, algorithms, systems design, software engineering principles—has increasingly become something you can “learn” in a few weeks. The job often gets reduced to moving data from point A to point B, orchestrating some tools, and calling it a day. And that’s fine on the surface—until you realize that many of these pipelines lack test coverage, versioning discipline, clear modularity, or even basic error handling.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is exactly what democratization looks like, and it’s a good thing. But I do wonder: are we trading depth for speed? And if so, what happens to the long-term quality of the systems we build?\n\nCurious to hear what others think—especially those with different backgrounds or who transitioned into DE through non-traditional paths.\n",

The input is around 30k rows. Output is the same because there's no filtering or aggregation; just creating new fields. No collect, count, or display statements (which would slow it down). \n\nThe main thing is a bunch of mappings I need to apply, but it depends on existing fields and there are various models I need to run. So the mappings are different depending on variable and model. That's where the for loops come in. \n\nNow I'm ***not*** iterating over the dataframe itself; just over 15 fields (different variables) and 4 different mappings. Then do that 10 times (once per model).\n\nThe worker is m5d 2x large and drivers are r4 2x large, min/max workers are 4/20. This should be fine. \n\nI attached a pic to illustrate the code flow. Does anything stand out that you think I could change or that you think Spark is slow at, such as json.load or create\\_map? ",

Every. Single. Day.\n- Dashboards don’t cover flexible needs, so it’s always a back-and-forth of “can you pull this?”\n- Game telemetry split across client/web/iOS/Android/brands—each with different behavior and screen sizes.\n- Streaming rewards and matchmaking in real time sounds cool—until you’re debugging Flink queues and job delays at 2AM.\n- Our big data stack looked “simple” on paper but turned into a maintenance monster: Kafka, Flink, Spark, MySQL, ZooKeeper, Airflow… all duct-taped together.\n\nWe once worked with a top-10 game where even a 50-person data team took 2–3 days to handle most requests. \n\nAnd don’t even get me started on security. With so many layers, if something breaks, good luck finding the root cause before business impact hits.\n\nSo my question to you:\nHas anyone here actually simplified their data pipeline for gaming workloads?\nWhat worked, what didn’t?\nAny experience moving away from the Kafka-Flink-Spark model to something leaner?",

        "author": "StriderAR7",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. \n\nHere’s the scenario: \n- We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. \n\n- Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)\n\n- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. \n\n\nWhile Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. \n\nFrom what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:\n- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many  files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). \n\n- Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. \n\n- Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. \n\nTo give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.\n\nThe main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!\n\nFor reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.\n\nHas anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines? Would love to hear your thoughts on whether they’re a good fit for such a scenario or not. ",

They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.\n\nImagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:\n\n- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.\n\n- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.\n\nIceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.\n\nWhy not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.\n\nThis would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.\n\nIs there any OSS project trying to do this today?\n\nAre there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?\n\nWould you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?\n",

        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nSo I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?\n\nHere’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. \n\nSo, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.\n\nYes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. \n\nAnd it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. \n\nBut the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details. Thanks. \n\nEDIT:\nThis is the query I'm running\n\nSELECT\n  SUB.ID,\n  SUB.COL1\nFROM (\n  SELECT\n    A.ID,\n    B.COL1,\n    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY B.ID ORDER BY B.COL2 DESC) AS RANK\n  FROM\n    A\n    LEFT JOIN B\n      ON A.ID = B.ID\n      AND A.SOME_COL = 'SOME_STRING'\n  ) SUB\nWHERE\n  RANK = 1",

My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.\n\nAt my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. \n\nI have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.\n\nBecause of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. \n\nMy plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db.  Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.\n\nSome of the questions i have:\n\n* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network\n* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? \n* Am i missing anything?\n\n",

I was hoping to get some constructive feedback on them, if you all would do me the honor. \n\nHere's some context for the images below:\n\n1. Scale of data is many terabytes to a few petabytes uncompressed. Largely sensor data. \n2. Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. \n3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. \n\nI have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.

Even though my background was analytics based, I had a connection that worked within the company and trusted I could pick up more of the backend engineering easily. I worked for that company for almost 3 years and unfortunately, got close to no applicable experience. They had previously outsourced their data engineering so we faced constant roadblocks with security in trying to build out our pipelines and data stack. In short, most of our time was spent arguing with security for reasons we needed access to data/tools/etc to do our job. They laid our entire team off last year and the job search has been brutal since. I’ve only gotten 3 engineering interviews from hundreds of applications and I’ve made it to the final round during each, only to be rejected because of technical engineering questions/problems I didn’t know how to figure out. I am very discouraged and wondering if data engineering is the right field for me. The data sphere is ever evolving and daunting, I already feel too far behind from my unfortunate first job experience. Some backend engineering concepts are still difficult for me to wrap my head around and I know now I much prefer the analysis side of things. I’m really hoping for some encouragement and suggestions on other routes to take as a very early career data professional. I’m feeling very burnt out and hopeless in this already difficult job market",

Pushing data into ClickHouse at high frequency is causing too many merge parts and system instability — to the point where insert blocks are occasionally being rejected. This is especially problematic since some of our data (like blocks and transactions) needs to be available in real-time, with query latency under 100ms.\n\nTo manage this better, we’re considering separating our ingestion strategy: keeping batch ingestion into ClickHouse for historical and analytical needs, while finding a way to access fresh data in real-time when needed — particularly for the GraphQL layer.\n\nWould love to get thoughts on how we can approach this — especially around managing real-time queryability while keeping ingestion efficient and stable.",

Getting into law school in Canada is really competitive, so as a backup plan, I’m considering starting an additional degree in data science in case law school doesn’t work out. My previous degree was almost completely free due to scholarships, and since I’m in the process of joining the military I can get a second degree subsidized.   \n\nI already have a BA, so I would like to use elective credits from my previous degree toward a BSc if that’s the route I take. The only issue is that a lot of Canadian universities don’t allow you to transfer credits from previously earned degrees. Because of this, I’ve been looking into less prestigious but equally accredited school options. \n\nMy concerns are mostly about co-op opportunities, networking, and how much school reputation influences your earning potential and career growth in this field. I know that law is pretty much a meritocracy in Canada, but the alumni connections made through your university can mean the difference between tens of thousands of dollars per year. \n\nIdeally, I want to go to a school that has strong co-op programs to gain experience, and would potentially want to do an honours thesis or project. I’ve spoken to some people in CS and they’ve recommended I just do a CE boot camp, or take a few coding classes at a community college and then pursue a MS in data science. I don’t like either of these suggestions because I feel that I wouldn’t have as strong a theoretical background as someone who completed a 4 year undergrad degree. \n\nAny insight would be really helpful!

        "content": "Hello dear people! Been dealing with this very interesting problem that I'm not 100% sure how to tackle. A local forum went down some time ago and they lost a few hours worth of data since backups aren't hourly. Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. \n\nNow it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably  colored, no idea.\n\nThe ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?\n\n- Somehow \"train\" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in \"half\", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something? I'm not sure I'm really new to this. The main goal is to have a nice json output with all data properly curated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany thanks! Much appreciated.",

All my*scriptsl* were using Faker but always extended with some additional usecase. This is how I ended up writing [glassgen](https://pypi.org/project/glassgen/). It generates synthetic data, sends it to a sink and is simply configured by a json config. It can also generate duplicates in the data (if you want) and can send at a defined rps (best effort). \n\nHappy to hear your feedback and hope you find the library useful. Thanks",

        "author": "jardata",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nWe have a source system that is only able to export data using a \"start\" and \"end\" date range. So for example, each day, we get a \"current month\" export for the data falling between the start of the month and the current day. We also get a \"prior month\" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a \"year to date\" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.\n\nNothing in the data export itself gives us an \"as of date\" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that \"falls\" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.\n\nI'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different \"fact\" models? One each for \"daily\" (sourced from the current month file), \"monthly\" (sourced from the prior month file), and \"yearly\" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO columns be sourced from in this case? The daily makes sense (I would source VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO from the \"end\" date of the data extract that keeps bumping out each day), but I don't know how that fits into the monthly or yearly data.\n\n  \nAny insight or help on this would be really appreciated.\n\nThank you!!",

        "content": "I have about 20 years worth of flat files stored in a folder on a network drive as a result of lackluster data practices. Essentially, three different flat files get printed to this folder on a nightly bases that represent three different types of data (think: person, sales, products). Essentially this data could exist as three separate long tables with date as key. \n\nI'd like to establish a proper data warehouse, but am unsure of how to best handle the process of warehousing these flats. I have been interfacing with the data through Python Pandas so far, but the company has a SQL server...It would probably be best to place the warehouse as a database on the server, then pull/manipulate the data from there? But what is tripping me up is the order of operations to perform in the warehousing procedure. I don't believe I would be able to dump into SQL server without profiling the data first as number of columns and the type of data stored in the flat files may have changed throughout the years.\n\n\n\nI am essentially struggling with how to sequence the process of : network drive flats > sql server db:\n\n  \nMy concerns are:\n\nBest method to profile the data?\n\nBest way to store the metadata?\n\nThrow flats into SQL server and then query them from there to perform data transformations/validations? \n\n  \\-- It seems without knowing the meta data, I should perform this step in Pandas first before loading into SQL server? What is the best practice for that? perform operations on each flat file separately or combine first (e.g., should I clean the data during the loop or after combining tables)?\n\n   \\-- Right now, I am creating a list of flat files, using that list to create a dictionary of dataframes, and then using that dictionary to create a dataframe of dataframes to group and concatenate into 3 long tables -- am I convoluting this process?\n\nHow to approach data cleaning/validation/and additional column calculations? e.g. -- Should I perform these procedures on each file separately before concatenating into a long table or perform these procedures after concatenation?-- Should I even concatenate into longs or keep them separate and define a relationship to their keys stored in a separate table?\n\nHow many databases for this process? One for raws? One for staging? A third as the datawarehouse to be queried?\n\nWhen to stage and how much of the process to perform in RAM/behind the scenes before printing to a new table?\n\nShould I consider compressing the data at any point in the process? (e.g. store as Parquet)\n\n\n\nThe data gets used for data analytics and to assemble reports/dashboards. Ideally, I would like to eliminate having to perform as many joins as possible during the querying for analysis process. I'd also like to orchestrate the warehouse so that adjustments only need to happen in a single place and propagate throughout the pipeline with a history of adjustments stored as record.",

It's a very small DE team (I'm the second guy they hired) with a historic reliance on low-code tooling I'm helping to migrate us off for scalability reasons.\n\nPreviously, we moved data into the report layer via the webhook notification generated by our DBT build process. It pinged a workflow in N8n which ran an ungainly web of many dozens of nodes containing copy-pasted and slightly-modified SQL statements executing in parallel whenever the build job finished. I went through these queries and categorized them into general patterns and made Jinja templates for each pattern. I am also in the process of modifying these statements to use materialized views instead, which is presenting other problems outside the scope of this post.\n\nI've been wondering about ways to manage templated SQL.

I know this is a low-level question for this sub, just hoping to put this somewhere where data experts might have some ideas!\n\nMy team performs on-site audits for a labor standards org. They involve many interviews, for which we take notes by hand on legal pads, and worksite walk-throughs, during which we take photos on our phone and make notes by hand. There are at least two team members taking notes and photos for the worksite walk through, and up to 4 team members interviewing different folks.\n\nWe then come to the office and transfer all of these handwritten notes to one shared google document (a template, breaking each topic out individually). From there, I read through these notes (30-50 pages worth, per audit...we do about one audit a week) and write the report/track some data in other locations (google sheets, SalesForce- all manually transferred).\n\nThis process is cumbersome and time-consuming. We have an opportunity to get a grant for tablets and software, if we can find a set up that may help with this.  \n\n\nDo you have any ideas about how to make this process more efficient through the use of technology? Maybe tablets can convert handwritten notes to type? Maybe there's a customizable program that would allow us to select the category, write out our notes which are then converted to type, and the info from that category automatically populates a doc with consolidated notes from each team member in the appropriate category? A quick note that we'd need offline-capability (these worksites are remote), something that would upload once in service/wifi.\n\nI'm obviously not a tech person, and we don't have one on our small team. Any, even small, leads for where to start looking for something that may be helpful would be so greatly appreciated!",

        "author": "dagovengo",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently i've been reading \"Designing Data Intensive Applications\" and I came across a concept that made me a little confuse.\n\nIn the section that discusses the diferent partition methods (Key Range, hash, etc) we are introduced to the concept of Secondary Indexes, in which a new mapping is created to help in the search for occurences of a particular value. The book gives two examples of data partitioning methods in this scenario:\n\n1. Partitioning Secondary Indexes By Document - The data in the distributed system is allocated to specific partition based on the key range defined to that partition (e.g.: partition 0 goes from 1-5000). \n2. Paritioning Secodary Indexes By Term - The data in the distributed system is allocated to a specific partition base on the value of a term (e.g: all documents with **term:valueX** go to partition N).\n\nIn both of the above methods a secondary index for a specific term is configured and for each value of this term a mapping like **term:value -> \\[documentX1\\_position, documentX2\\_position\\]** is created. \n\nMy question is how does the primary index and secondary index coexist? The book states that Key Range and Hash partition in the primary index can be employed alongside with the methods mentioned above for the secondary index, but it's not making sense in my head.\n\nFor instance, if a Hash partition is employed for the data system documents that have a hash that belongs in partition N hash range will be stored there, but what if partition N has a partitioning term (e.g: **color = red**) based method for a secondary index and the document doesn't belong there (e.g.: document has **color = blue**)? Wouldn't the hash based partition mess up the idead behind partitioning based on term value?\n\nI also thought about the possibility of the document hash being assigned based on the partition term value (e.g.: document\\_hash = hash(document\\[\"color\"\\])), but then (if I'm not mistaken) we wouldn't have the advantages of uniform distribution of data between partitions that hash based partitioning brings to the table, because all of the hashes in the term partition would be the same (same values).\n\nMaybe I didn't understood it properly, but it's not making sense in my head.",

        "content": "Hello everyone. I thought I just wanted to share this experience with you. So I've been programming for the past 8-7 years now, I think? I'm 20 rn and I started at like 12 or something just dabbling around with Python + some html css (they're not programming languages but you know, intro stuff). I've always been kind of off with my math back then and was horrible at it. I've always just approached the problems in my code with just intuitive problem solving. You know, things that might just work.\n\nThese past months though, I've been getting really interested in math. So much so, that it has replaced my hobby of progamming (lol). What I noticed though was just how different I think about certain concepts. For example, functions. Back then, I kind of just thought of this as some wrapper of code that I can call whenever I wanted to. But getting to learn more about them in Calculus and how much I can manipulate them, it has also translated to my programming skills. Instead of just a wrapper for my code, I treat them now like actual items that take in parameters and spits out an output. Of course like, duh, but it really has changed my perspective and style on how I code now. Back then, it's more programming first then do the math to check. Now, it's math first, and let my code check if my math was correct. If it's correct, my code runs. If not, then math was wrong.\n\nI just wanted to share this insight with you guys who may be struggling to grasp some concepts in programming. Maybe, learning where these concepts came from might actually give you a deeper understanding of what they actually do.",

It's designed to teach you how to read the HTML and CSS specifications to keep yourself educated in the future, and understand how browser internals work so you can create beautiful, accessible, semantic, and performant web sites and applications.\n\nI think semantic HTML and CSS are seriously neglected skills by coders in the web development arena. In the course we also do multiple modern projects, and talk about how to get an LLM to produce the best quality HTML and CSS.\n\nIf you manage to grab a seat, an honest review is much appreciated, but even if you don't I just hope it helps your career.   \n  \nAnd don't despair about AI! If you understand what you're doing, you can use an LLM properly, and become a fast producer of quality code.\n\nHere's the link, it's first-come, first-serve, and expires in 5 days: [https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=448BEC248CEC73F2AEA8](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=448BEC248CEC73F2AEA8)\n\nHappy HTML and CSS authoring,\n\nTony Alicea",

How can I manipulate the pixels on monitor to make my own GUI? I wasn't taught anything about this stuff and it feels like the programming I was being taught was extremely shallow. I can code a binary tree, I know about pointers and classes, but that's about it. I could make text based stuff, but how do I study the code on a deeper level?

For example if I have a function that’s supposed to take the factorial of a number, on paper I’ll write down how if there’s an input of 6, it should multiply 1 by 6 then go into a 2nd recursion layer to multiply 6 by 5, and so on.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a junior Computer Science student who transferred after completing one year at a local community college. I was super excited to transfer just one hour away because the program has project-based classes, and that was exactly what I was looking for. After a tough and competitive admission process, I was finally able to get into the program. It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.\n\nLast fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking—something that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.\n\nAs a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I’m back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can’t help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don’t know how to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or just has some perspective on what my next steps should be. How do I rebuild my confidence and get back on track ",

I have literally sent hundreds of personalised applications (resume + cover letter) for most of them and got only like 8% of answers, most of them being automatic rejections. I initially applied for machine learning/computer vision (my major at school) openings, but since there is no way I ever get one of those, I've widely reduced the importance of what I'd like to do in order to send more applications.\n\nEven when I get to go to the technical tests, and perform (I have had platforms telling me things like you performed better than 95% of candidates), I still get rejected without getting to the interview phase, \"we've had a lot of competitive applicants bla bla bla\". The only interviews I got are from Belgian societies, refusing me even though they don't pay their interns. I mean, even for free (for them bc it would be a lot of money for me to get there), they wouldn't have me work for them ??? This is just crazy.\n\nI have already worked half-time for more than 4 years alongside my studies, meaning that I have at the very least 2 years of full-time professional software engineering and that seems to not count at all, I've even had interviewers telling it didn't count as experience and that I was a junior with less knowledge than a student who wouldn't have worked during his studies (I admit that I left the interview after hearing this bs)\n\nI tried many different things on my resume & letters to not get rejected by the automated TAS. Many people reviewed what I sent, so I don't think that the problem comes from there.\n\nI mean, how are we supposed to find internships in CS ? Is this really the result of those 5 years of studies ? Absolutely no consideration from companies that I'd love to work for ? I'm losing my mind over this..\n\nThat feeling of rejection/not being enough, even though I have proven multiple times that I can provide valuable workforce to campanies is just unbearable. Having people telling me that I should persist is now my new most listened song of 2025, but you guessed it : not my favorite.\n\nSometimes it makes me want to scream after thinking of all those efforts to apply that won't ever bring me anything but sadness and despair.\n\nFinally, I don't understand why I should intern to graduate. How in the world can I not already look for a fucking job and call it a day since I already validated all the exams ? This just feel like I have to be a poorly paid (or not paid at all) person to graduate, even though the reason for that is absolutely unclear.\n\nSorry if this is a little out of subject, I just wanted to share my experience of looking for internships after having decided, in 2019, that I wanted to learnprogramming. Thanks for reading.\n\n  \nEdit: Added that the internship must be abroad and that I'm from France",

I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.\n\nI still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.\n\nI feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.\n\nSo, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it.

Despite all the confusion at the start, the stress, and the mental blocks, I pulled through and proved to myself that I can do this.\n\nI’m proud of myself - and honestly, I just wanted to hear it from someone else too. I usually keep things to myself and don’t socialize much. But if anyone else out there is in the middle of the struggle: please don’t give up. It’s hard, but you’re not alone, and moments like this do happen.\n\nThanks for reading.\n",

I’ve been practicing and taking Udemy courses in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for about a year now, maybe a little more. I’ve managed to get a decent grasp of both technologies. I can create a static page using HTML and CSS, and I can add a bit of interactivity with JavaScript and understand it somewhat. Of course, I’m not capable of building a large application yet, but I understand a lot more than when I first started.\nLately, I’ve been feeling insecure and anxious, wondering if maybe it’s already too late for me to pursue this. When I look for junior jobs, there seem to be literally none.\nI really enjoy the fact that I can see what I create — like building a page, an accordion, a navigation bar, or dynamically hiding or adding something. Being able to actually see what I make is something I love.\nMy plan B would be to quickly take some fiber optics classes and move towards networking, but I don’t think it would take me as far.\nIs it already too late for me to get into web development? 33yr old btw ;(\n",

        "author": "hello_aaron",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.\n\nBackground: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer job\n\nProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.\n\nI’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this. Thank you so much in advance for your help!",

Is this true? Additionally, would it be possible for me to learn Java and Python within this time frame? I will probably have around two-three hours to work on it every single day. \n\nLastly, should I learn a different language rather than python? ",

So my understanding is that a QA tester position would be a solid start as it commonly uses python just like the late game fields I want to get into.\n\nAnd a good start would be appreciated cus I'm totally broke!\n\nI'm starting with CS50's python course, and I know I need to create my own personal projects and stuff like leetcode to put in my portfolio.\n\nIf anyone has any recommendations, direction, advice or would like to point out that my logic is sound or messed up, please let me know!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but I tried asking in r/computerscience, and they removed it, saying it was off-topic. I honestly don’t know how this doesn't qualify, since I’m trying to understand a conceptual difference.\n\nAnyway, here's my question.\n\nI got the structure of the `Memory` chip from GitHub. Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors:\n\n    CHIP Memory {\n        IN in[16], load, address[15];\n        OUT out[16];\n    \n        PARTS:\n            DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd);\n            Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram);\n            RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout);\n            Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout);\n            Keyboard(out=kbout);\n            Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out);\n    }\n\nNow, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`:\n\n    (loop)\n    @24577\n    D=M\n    @1\n    M=D\n    @loop\n    0;JMP\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.\n* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.\n* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.\n* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.\n* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.\n* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\\[1\\].\n\nNow, here’s my confusion:  \nHow is this different from the following?\n\n    (loop)\n    @24576\n    D=M\n    @1\n    M=D\n    @loop\n    0;JMP\n\nBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?\n\nedit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them. Sorry about that.",

Explaining them is.\n\nSolving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:\n\nFraming your approach in simple, accessible terms  \n\nSurfacing trade-offs before you're even asked  \n\nStaying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them  \n\nBecause of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a \"30-second version\", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.\n\nSometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the \"just code it\" mindset.\n\nCurious if others have similar experiences.

        "author": "divad1196",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Disclaimer: this post is also to vent.\n\nI got into a debate on something that I didn't think was so badly understood. The debate was with people claiming that \"big O notation is just counting the number of instructions\" and \"you must abstract away things like CPU\".\n\nThese claims are formally incorrect and only apply for specific contexts. The big O (and little o) notation is a mathematical concept to explain how something grow. It is never mentionned \"instruction\" as this isn't a mathematical concept. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)\n\nThe reason why we \"abstract\" the CPU, and other stuff, is because if 2 algorithms run on the same computer, we can expect them be impacted in the same way. \n\n\"All instruction take the same time\" (not all instruction take the same time, but the execution duration of an instruction is considered majored by a constant. A constant doesn't impact the growth, we can define this number to be `1`). In **simple** cases, the time is a function of the the number of instruction `n`, something like `duration(n) -> INSTRUCTION_DT * n` \n\nWhen you compare 2 univariate (\"mono-variadic\") algorithms in the same context, you get things like `dt * n_1 > dt * n_2`. For `dt > 0`, you can simplify the comparison with `n_1 > n_2`.\n\nSimilarly, when the number of instruction is fix on one side and vary on the other side, then it's easier to approximate a constant by `1`. The big O notation cares about the growth, there is none and that's all we care about, so replace a constant by 1 makes sense.\n\nBack to the initial point: we don't \"count the instruction\" or \"abstract\" something. We are trying to define how somethings grows.\n\nNow, the part where I vent.\nThe debate started because I agreed with someone's example on an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(1/n)`. The example of code was `n => sleep(5000/n)`.\n\nThe response I got was \"it's 1 instruction, so O(1)` and this is incorrect. `O(1)` in time complexity would mean: \"even if I change the value of N, the program will take the same time to finish\" whereas it is clear here that the bigger N is, the faster the program finishes.\n\nIf I take the opposite example: `n => sleep(3600 * n)` and something like `Array(n).keys().reduce((a, x) => a + x))`\nBased on their response, the first one has a time complexity of `O(1)` and the second one `O(n)`. Based on that, the first one should be faster, which is never the case.\n\nSame thing with space complexity: does `malloc(sizeof(int) * 10)` has the same space complexity has `malloc(sizeof(int) * n)` ? No. The first one is `O(1)` because it doesn't grow, while the second one is `O(n)`\n\nThe reason for misunderstanding the big O notation is IMO:\n- school simplify the context (which is okay)\n- people using it never got the context.\n\n\nOf course, that's quite a niche scenario to demonstrate the big O misconception. But it exposes an issue that I often see in IT: people often have a narrow/contextual understanding  on things. This causes, for example, security issues. Yet, most people will prefer to stick to their believes than learning.\n\n\nAdditional links (still wikipedia, but good enough)\n- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory (see \"Important Complexity Classes\")\n- DTIME complexity: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTIME\n",

Plus I think it would be a good skill to have.\n\nIs it possible for me to learn enough to be able to make apps (don’t particularly care about how it looks at the beginning more so just the function, but down the line would like to have it look neat and nice) and also I know Python can be used for backend stuff, can it also be used for frontend or would I need to learn syntax of a different language.\n\nThanks for the help in advance.\n\nNote: I am not looking to become a software engineer at the moment, maybe if I enjoy the app creation I might think about that in the future but my current job is quite easy and pays decent.",

Our goal was to hire 5 AI engineering and data science interns for the summer.\n\nWe got freaking *10,000* applications for our summer internship program. TEN THOUSAND. After screening all that mess (using some AI tool I admit to sort / filter) we narrowed it down to around 200 people who seemed qualified enough for take-home coding challenges.\n\nWant to know the crazy part? Out of those 200 challenges, barely 10 people made it to the final interview round. And we ended up making just ONE offer when we wanted to hire 5 people.\n\nWhat was the dealbreaker? Almost nobody could explain their own damn code when we asked them about it. Like 99% of these candidates just vibe coded their way through the take-home challenge (let's be real - they used AI) without understanding what the hell they were submitting. I literally asked one candidate why they used a certain Python package and they had no idea what it did.\n\nOn the on-site, we had to reject 9/10 candidates. Most of them when they got to the onsite just couldn't pass the bar.\n\nPart of the reason why we hired the one candidate that passed was because he showed some honesty. A few people in the hiring panel said that the candidate admitted that he had seen one or two of the questions on LeetCode / Interview Query. So they apparently asked him a different question and he was thoughtful about explaining the solution even though he missed getting one of them 100% right.\n\nSo here's my PSA to anyone applying for tech jobs: Use AI all you want, but make sure you actually understand the code you're submitting. If you can't explain your approach or debug issues without AI holding your hand, you're gonna crash and burn in any decent technical interview. And you'll be absolutely useless on a real team. Otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time, including your own.\n\nAnd don't assume just because you're interviewing at an AI company that THEY WANT YOU TO USE AI FOR EVERYTHING!!!\n\n",

        "author": "Hazjut",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TL;DR:\nAfter years of chasing a tech career that never paid or stabilized, I am leaving for a career that can support a family and offer real security. I still love tech, but I had to move on to survive.\n\n\nI thought tech would be the future I built my life on. It didn’t work out.\n\nI chased a tech career for years, but it never came together. Ironically, I made the equivalent of around $80k a year in the military before I even had a degree, and some years a bit more. After graduating, despite years of effort, I never made over $80k again. After unstable contracts, low pay, no benefits, and rising living costs, I found a different career starting around $140k total comp and quickly climbs toward $200k and beyond, offering real retirement options and meaning that tech never did for me.\n\nI started coding for fun at 16, back in 2006. It was not rare, but it was far less common than it is today. When college came, I should have taken on debt and jumped into tech earlier. But I saw loans like credit card debt, and my family did too. We did not understand grants or aid. I was the first in my family to pursue a degree. Instead, I joined the military to pay for college.\n\nWhile serving, I started taking tech seriously. I built projects, took classes early, and did well both academically and physically. I am a combat veteran. After leaving, I moved to a major west coast city, earned a degree from a respected state university, and started trying to build a tech career.\n\nI completed two internships at large tech companies, but after graduating around the time layoffs began sweeping the industry, I could not find work for about a year. When I finally broke in, I spent the next few years grinding through mostly contract roles, including development, support, and program management, at two FAANG companies. Most paid well under $80k, with no benefits. Even working over 40 hours a week, I was barely surviving. And it left me drained trying to find new work throughout those three years while I worked over 40 hours. I had eventually applied to thousands of jobs even though many were targeted applications. It was consuming my life with no benefit.\n\nOver the last few years, I interviewed for about 20 roles, but nothing stuck. Pay stagnated, inflation rose, contracts ended, interviews were canceled mid-process because of layoffs and outsourcing. I did not want to leave tech. But eventually, the cost of living made it impossible to stay. I am starting a family and I want to buy a home, and the path I was on in tech could not support either.\n\nI needed something meaningful I could rely on for career growth and stability. That is when I turned to law enforcement. It shares some overlap with the military in structure, though it is not the same. For me the constant deployments were the only thing I didn't enjoy, and this is the closest I could find that felt similar without needing to travel overseas constantly. It felt like a better fit for the life I needed to build.\n\nNow, I am starting my new career. In many major west coast cities, law enforcement compensation surprisingly matches or beats the tech roles I once chased. Retirement comes in your early 50s if you want it, without penalty. I plan to use my GI Bill for a master's degree and eventually specialize in areas like police forensics. It is already improving my quality of life.\n\nI am mourning the career and identity I once imagined. But I am hopeful about what lies ahead. This path will eventually give me the freedom, disposable income, and stability to return to tech on my own terms, whether that means building my own product, starting a company, or, if nothing else, creating open-source tools that still have real impact.

        "content": "I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not saying FAANG or Big Tech sucks. It has its pros, but it also has its cons. Same with non-tech companies. But looking back on my years in the industry.. I just want to reflect on my experience and post about it.\n\nWhen I was just starting out, I thought I had it all figured out. Like so many others in this sub, I had one goal drilled into my brain: FAANG or bust. I thought if I was not at a top tech company or at least something adjacent, I was failing. That prestige, that resume clout, that salary, it was all that mattered.\n\nFast forward to today. I am at a FAANG-adjacent company, something people would brag about on LinkedIn, and honestly I am exhausted. I am not even talking about having a busy week tired. I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.\n\nEven my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.\n\nAnd then there are my other friends.\n\nThe ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.\n\nWhen we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.\n\nThey are happy. Genuinely happy.\n\nThey have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.\n\nWhen I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.\n\nI was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness. My actual life outside of work. I thought prestige would make it all worth it, but you cannot deposit mental stability into a bank account. You cannot get back the years of stress you burned through trying to chase a logo on a resume.\n\nI am proud of what I have achieved. But if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ***Prestige is not everything. Stability and happiness matter more than any brand name ever will.***\n\nTo anyone out there grinding away and feeling miserable but telling themselves it will all be worth it once they get to the next step. Please remember that you are allowed to choose a different path. You are allowed to choose yourself over the brand. It is not giving up. It is winning in a different way.",

        "content": "Are they really that incompetent/useless? How long does it actually take them to become productive? \n\nI remember back before covid when bootcamps were popping. A lot of them were advertising and boasting that their (bootcamp grads) were becoming productive in a few weeks, while it took university grads 1 year to become productive (based on market research). Does it actually take that long?\n\nI've also heard stories that a surprisingly large number of fresh grads can't even solve fizzbuzz.\n\nI find all of this stuff so puzzling. Say that you graduated with a degree in CS. Maybe you have one fullstack CRUD app to your name as a personal project, and maybe you did a team project in school where you used git and worked with a team of people where you made a  technical toy project that required some problem solving, no fancy UI or anything like that.\n\nWhat is realistically that difference between this person and someone who has 2-3 years work experience as a developer that also have to learn a new tech stack? \n\nI can't really see why the new grad would necessarily be worse, or not given a chance. To me it mostly comes down to IQ, personal ability, personality, communication skills etc.  \n\nSure, in an application process its hard to give the \"new grad\" a chance. But if you give them an interview at least they can show their personality/how they think about things. \n\nI've also heard that everyone is saying that there's 1000 applicants for every job, that's why people with 0 experience get 0 interviews. But how is that even possible, and wouldn't it eventually even out? If there's 20k available jobs, and 20k available candidates, some jobs aren't being filled. I guess new grads are just so incredibly bad that the loss of hiring them is way bigger than not having a filled position?\n\nAlso how does AI play into this? Is juniors just so bad that any senior just automatically does the job now with AI 10x as fast? So there's no need for juniors?",

In that case, trying to make an argument that you aren’t responsible for something is more likely to make you seem like you can’t take accountability.\n\nOr, in a feedback session, you get negative reviews from them on your performance for what seems like arbitrary reasons and you want to give an explanation/justification. In this case, there’s no explaining away what they’ve decided. You’re more likely to come off as insecure and argumentative for talking back.\n\n\nI’m not going to give a speech about how maybe you need to do self-reflection and practice humility; sometimes you’ll be in the right and you know you’re in the right. But career-wise, being right < manager being pleased.\n\n90% of the time, your manager has already made up his mind on how he feels about a situation.\n\nPart of your manager’s role is assessing your performance and giving feedback. So when you push back, not only are you expressing that you disagree with their opinion, you’re also coming across that you think you are better at their job than them (maybe you are?).\n\nI write this because I’m usually a self-advocate outside of work, but I’ve gotten to a point where I have to tell myself “it’s not worth it” quite a bit because of how important it is to not be a problem employee in this economy. \n\nThe best recoveries I’ve had when I’m given feedback or told negative things (that I personally feel like are not my fault) is to not disagree or try to explain, it’s just thank them for the feedback and keep working.",

Interview with both founders -- but separately, so two different meetings\n\n\n\nI got rejected at the 6th and final stage.\n\n\n\nThe feedback was that my technical expertise was spot on but that I didn't communicate the impact I had on previous teams well enough.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a 31M with about four years of software engineering experience. I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.\n\nCurrently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)\n\nFor example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.\n\nSome extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.\n\nThat said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.\n\nI'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change? Look for a new opportunity elsewhere?  Thanks!",

        "author": "Pyciko_",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new \"JSON of binary world\". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).\n\n1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).\n2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.\n3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)\n4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.\n5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.\n\nAnd so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.\n\nNow I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf.  \nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?\n2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?\n3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",

        "author": "thefox13guy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.\n\nWell, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.\n\nI've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one \"onsite\" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.\n\nHere is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.\n\nBut after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, \"So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?\" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do \"Big Tech non-sense\", or that I'll be a hard to work with.\n\nDo any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this? Seeing as how I am just looking for a local tech job where I can get work done and enjoy my time with the team, maybe I should just remove it from my work history?",

One member of the team is demonstrating the use of a custom library he is maintaining to abstract away every 3rd party library we currently use. It is a great piece of work and allows us to write less brittle tests and try out competing libraries more easily. \n\nProblem the team sees is the loss of direct access to these libraries is a loss of control and potential unknowingly misusing the underlying library through the abstraction layers.\n\nGiving up the need to have intimate knowledge about these libraries feels like strapping on a blind fold and never knowing how you got to the destination. From a career standpoint, it is deadend tech you can't take with you.\n\nWdyt?",

But it's just seeing that he's getting a bit more anxious than usual and seeing that he's a bit snappier leads me into feeling like he's almost (again, hard to say for sure) being a bit passive-aggressive with wanting us - or, at the very least, me - to pump things out quicker but with less bugs. idk, I just somehow get the feeling like I'm not living up to what he wants, and it makes me feel a bit disappointed in myself.",

I know it's tough out there.*  \n  \nHow can they make the most of these opportunities?\n\nFor example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)?  \n  \nIf you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?\n\nIn my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.\n\nSo knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",

I have a job offer at Honeywell for 104k base no bonus in Phoenix, AZ, as an Electrical Engineer 2 in military avionics. I was told its a mix of hardware and software for this role. My goal for my career is to get into software preferably at a tech company as I enjoy coding and know the pay is better. I work on side projects and plan on getting certifications and such to help appeal to those tech companies hopefully soon. I know I will prefer Phoenix in terms of location but I am unsure of what might be better for my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.\n\nI have received e-contracts that I've clicked \"sign\" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.\n\nMy start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:\n\n1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.\n2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.\n3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?\n\nWhat would be the most professional approach in this situation? Any insights from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I've ever quit a job, so I'm a little lost and anxious here.",

But I struggle with configuration files stuff like Helm Charts, yml/yaml files, etc. just looking for resources how to get more proficient with these because I feel like an idiot always asking people for help on those.

I didn't choose to be in COBOL; that's what they trained and assigned me to and I didn't have anywhere else to go to at that time. I could have left and tried to go for a more useful tech stack after 2 years but the pandemic happened so looking for a new job was impossible. When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.\n\nMy problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.\n\nTo make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.\n\nMeanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.\n\nDid they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky? How do I even ask my manager to put me in a project that allows me to gain experience with cloud development, microservices, frameworks, and all that trendy stuff? There is an opportunity in my company that wants COBOL developers and maybe I could make it as a senior COBOL developer but I fear that it's only going to exacerbate my current issue. How does one even navigate this? I feel like I have to choose between catching up in experience as a Java developer or being a senior COBOL developer in a rapidly declining language.",

My ultimate goal and wish is to be a better software engineer and eventually grow to be a senior someday (I am 27 yo and about to finish my CS degree with a data science specialisation)\n\nIn total I have about 3 YOE, in my previous role I was a fullstack developer working with a Java Spring Boot/Angular tech stack in an agile environment and micro services and it was fun and dynamic but the culture was horrible and eventually burnt me out.\n\nNow I am working in the IT department of a finance related company that used to be very small and recently grew since ~1,5 years but in the IT department the processes haven't really adapted yet. Legacy code base with huge theoretical complexity (Java, Spring, Maven, JavaFX) and a web application that is built in Angular (15-17) built by an external service provider with 5-6 developers from that company that have made software for us for the past 15 years. Me and another colleague were hired so they have internal 'back-up' but the communication is difficult, we don't have any project management basically, very waterfall based, barely any structured work, deadlines or planning. We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches I've usually been familiar with. \n\nWe hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves. We are severly undermanaged and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, work ethic and confidence. I feel kind of depressed to be honest. Everytime I get a spark of hope and optimism and suggest new ideas or ask for more projects or new projects where I can play around and not struggle with the spaghetti codebase, it gets crushed.\n\nI love my coworkers and feel comfortable on a personal level. The pay is good and the job is very safe/stable so I feel so guilty and bad about feeling so lost work wise. I really don't know what to do, I am scared to give up the stability this job gives me but I feel like I am capable of more. I feel very safe here but at the same time I feel like I am wasting away the best years of my career by stagnating in a dysfunctional company. What do I do?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: severly undermanaged and not seeing any possibility to grow and use my skills in current job and feeling guilty about giving up a positive work environment/culture",

Now, I'm working on a .NET enterprise product that's a monolith and plenty of decade-old code. I'm not complaining - it has its fair share of interesting problems too. But it just makes me wonder, since I'm seeing there are relatively more .NET/Java jobs than Go, how much of the industry is \"uncool\"? What percentage of companies are actually having scalability or performance issues and using the hot new tech?\n\nJust for fun, let me compile some topics I think is cool/uncool.

I've been taking online courses on several things like REACT, .NET fullstack, and databases, to learn useful skills but still feels so helpless since I don't have the time to grind leetcode like I used to. It's all so frustrating because I know how to program, I'm a good learner, and some part of me still wants this career so badly. But, I'm 25 now and hate how unworthy I feel solely because I'm a real person with struggles that got the best of me. \n\nAnyways, I don't know what kind of advice I'm expecting, unloading this was more of a therapeutic release because I feel ashamed when I talk about this with my friends. I just need something to help me wake up and stop feeling like I failed myself.",

I'm putting in the work - applied to 160 jobs last month alone. Gonna top 200 this month. All of these are jobs that that were posted in the last 24 hours. I dedicate myself to job searching every weekday. I'm learning tech stacks that aren't on my resume (python, node, typescript, react). I've applied to senior positions (where I am professionally), mid-level, and even junior positions. I've applied to jobs that would give me a 20% paycut. Local jobs, remote jobs, hybrid jobs... (I don't have a car, so hoping if I can get my foot in the door, I can work out time to earn a paycheck and get a car). During the 5 months that I've been searching for a job, I've had one follow-up where someone said they were interested, and then ghosted. Other than that, it's been all rejections and no responses. I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong. I get that the industry is in crisis at the moment, largely due to the huge tax burden being a developer in the US causes now.\n\nAre y'all devs with more than 10 years experience also facing such huge challenges in finding a job? Are y'all using bots to apply or something? I'm out of ideas on what else to do and close to losing unemployment trying to stay afloat during this sucky time. I also don't get how a job posted less than a half an hour ago can already attract \"over 100 applicants\". I can't keep doing the same thing over and over and I'm at my wit's end.",

        "content": "TL;DR : I have built some projects in ES and SE and liked ES a bit more but find SE to have more opportunities even though it might become so boring and hellish. Didn't try building any ML projects but I think ML jobs will be highly demanded in the future due to the fast progress of AI and what people are saying online (maybe thats just hype).\n\nI can't decide between software engineering, embedded systems and machine learning. I like them all and have had experience with some of them but I know that I can't be a jack of all trades.\n\nFor embedded systems, I have built 2 arduino projects back in high school (currently I'm in my second year of CS uni). First one was a basic project with some LEDs and some code to make the LEDs light in different ways. Second one was a car that follows a black line and avoids obstacles. I really enjoyed and loved it. Though I have no idea what the market is for ES.\n\nFor software engineering, I have not made any full projects, just some basic terminal projects, like fizzbuzz and some python scripts that automated some tasks for me. I'm currently in the process of making my first uni project (a games library with search and user authentification functionalities). I'm also going to have an internship this summer as a web dev. I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).\n\nFor machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a \"goldmine\" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.\n\nI know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).\n\nWhat should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?\n\nAnd how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?\n\nI appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",
