        "author": "BoredAt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is a long article, so sit down and get some popcorn üôÇ\n\nAt this point everyone here has already read of the newest merger on the block. I think it's been (at least for me) a bit difficult to get the full story of why and whats going. I‚Äôm going to try to give what I suspect is really going on here and why it's happening.\n\n*TLDR: Fivetran is getting squeezed on both sides and DBT has hit its peak, so they‚Äôre trying to merge to take a chunk off the warehouses and reach Databricks valuation (10b atm -> 100b Databricks/Snowflake)*\n\nFirst, a collect of assumptions from my side:\n\n* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the top by warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake) commoditizing EL for their enterprise contracts. Why ask your enterprise IT team to get legal to review another vendor contract (which will take another few 100ks of the budget) when you can do just 1 vendor? With EL at cost (cause the money is in query compute, not EL)?\n* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the bottom by much cheaper commoditized vendors (Airbyte, DLTHub, Rivery, etc.)\n* DBT has peaked and isn‚Äôt really growing much.\n\n\nFor the first, the [proof](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-open-data-infrastructure) from DBTs article:\n\n> As a result, customers became frustrated with the tool-integration challenges and the inability to solve the larger, cross-domain problems. Customers began demanding more integrated solutions‚Äîasking their existing vendors to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù and leave in-house teams to solve fewer integration challenges themselves. Vendors saw this as an opportunity to grow into new areas and extend their footprints into new categories. This is neither inherently good nor bad. End-to-end solutions can drive cleaner integration, better user experience, and lower cost. But they can also limit user choice, create vendor lock-in, and drive up costs. The devil is in the details.\n\n> In particular, the data industry has, during the cloud era, been dominated by five huge players, each with well over $1 billion in annual revenue: Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Each of these five players started out by building an analytical compute engine, storage, and a metadata catalog. But over the last five years as the MDS story has played out, each of their customers has asked them to ‚Äúdo more.‚Äù And they have responded. Each of these five players now includes solutions across the entire stack: ingestion, transformation, notebooks and BI, orchestration, and more. They have now effectively become ‚Äúall-in-one data platforms‚Äù‚Äîbring data, and do everything within their ecosystem.\n\nFor the second point, you only need to go to the pricing page of any of the alternatives. Fivetran is expensive, plan and simple. For the third, I don‚Äôt really have any formal proof. You can take it as my opinion I suppose.\n\nWith those 3 facts in mind, it seems like the game for DBTran (I‚Äôm using that name from now one üôÇ) is then to try to flip the board on the warehouses. Normally, the data warehouse is where things start, with other tools (think data catalogs, transformation layer, semantic layer, etc.) being an add on that they try to commoditize. This is why snowflake and databricks are worth 100b+. Instead, DBTran is trying to make the warehouse be the commodity. This is namely by using a somewhat new tech. Iceberg (not gonna explain iceberg here, feel free to read that elsewhere).\n\n\nIf Iceberg is implemented, then compute and storage are split. The traditional warehouse vendors (bigquery, clickhouse, snowflake, etc.) are simply compute engines on top of the iceberg tables. Merely another component that can be switched out at will. Storage is an s3 bucket. DBTran would then be the rest. It would look a bit like:\n\n* Storage - **S3, GCS, etc.** \n* Compute - **Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.**\n* Iceberg Catalog - **DBTran**\n* EL - **DBTran**\n* Transformation Layer - **DBTran**\n* Semantic Layer - **DBTran**\n\nThey could probably add more stuff here. Buy Lightdash maybe and get into BI? But I don‚Äôt imagine they would need to (not a big enough market). Rather, I suspect they want to take a chunk off the big guys. So get that sweet, sweet compute enterprise budget by carving them out in half and eating it.\n\nSo should anyone in this subreddit care? I suppose it depends. If you don‚Äôt care about what tool you use, its business as usual. You‚Äôll get something for EL, something for T and so on. Data engineering hasn‚Äôt fundamentally changed. If you care about OSS (which I do) then this is worth watching. I‚Äôm not sure if this is good or bad. I wouldn‚Äôt switch to DBT Fusion anytime soon. But if by any chance DBTran make the semantic layer and the EL OSS (even on an elastic license) then this might actually be a good thing for OSS. Great even.\n\nBut I wouldn‚Äôt bet on that. DBT made Metricsflow proprietary. Fivetran is proprietary. If you want OSS, its best to look elsewhere.",

I work mainly with AWS, and I‚Äôm having some trouble understanding exactly how Databricks improves a pipeline and in what ways it simplifies development.\n\nRight now, we‚Äôre using Athena + dbt, with MWAA for orchestration. We‚Äôve fully adopted Athena, and one of its best features for us is the federated query capability. We currently use that to access all our on-prem data, we‚Äôve successfully connected to SAP Business One, SQL Server and some APIs, and even went as far as building a custom connector using the SDK to query SAP S/4HANA OData as if it were a simple database table.\n\nWe‚Äôre implementing the bronze, silver, and gold (with iceberg) layers using dbt, and for cataloging we use AWS Glue databases for metadata, combined with Lake Formation for governance.\n\nAnd so for our dev experience is just making sql code all day long, the source does not matter(really) ... If you want to move data from the OnPrem side to Aws you just do \"create table as... Federated (select * from table) and that's it... You moved data from onprem to aws with a simple Sql, it applies to every source \n\nSo my question is: could you provide clear examples of where Databricks actually makes sense as a framework, and in what scenarios it would bring tangible advantages over our current stack?",

The first 8 years of my career was in a consulting company doing a mixture of analytics and data migration activities as part of SaaS implementations (generally ERP/CRM systems). I guess an important thing to note was I genuinely felt like I knew what I was doing and was critical within the implementation projects.\n\n A couple of years ago I switched to a data architecture role at a tech company. Since day 1 I've felt behind my peers who I feel have much stronger skills in data modeling. With my consulting background and lack of formal CS learning, I feel like my knowledge of a traditional development lifecycle are missing and consequently feel like I deliver sub par work, along with other imposter syndrome type effects. Realistically I know the company wanted me for my experience and skills and maybe to be different to existing employees but I can't shake the feeling of unease. \n\nAny suggestions to improve here? Stick it out longer and hope things become clearer (they have over time but it's still hard to keep up), or return to the consulting world where I was more comfortable but now armed with a few more technical skills and less corporate bullshit.",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nThis might be a very dumb or ignorant question from me who know very little about DevOps or best practices in DE but would be great if I can stand on the shoulders of giants!\n\nFor the background context, I'm working as a quant engineer at a company with about 400 employees total (60\\~80 IT staff, separate from our quant/data team which consists of 4 people, incl myself). Our team's trying to build out our analytics infrastructure and our IT department has set up **completely separate environments** for DEV, UAT, and PROD including:\n\n* Separate Snowflake accounts for each environment\n* Separate managed Airflow deployments for each environment\n* GitHub monorepo with protected branches (dev/uat/prod) for code (In fact, this is what I asked for. IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)\n\nThis setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:\n\n* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing\n* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated\n* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in Snowflake\n\nI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.\n\n# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:\n\n* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?\n* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?\n* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support\n* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to  generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?\n\nAgain, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful. \n\nThanks in advance for any insights and enjoy your rest of Sunday!",

        "content": "Sorry I‚Äôm posting from a new account as my main one indicates my full name.\n\nI'm a fairly new hire at a fintech company that deals with payment data from a bunch of different banks and clients. I was hired a few months ago as a Data Analyst but the role has become super flexible right now, and I'm basically the only person purely focused on data.\n\nI spent the first few months under the Operations team helping with reconciliation (since my manager, who is now gone, wasn't great at it), using Excel/Google Sheets and a few Python scripts to expedite that process. That messy part is thankfully over, and I'm free to do data stuff.\n\nThe problem is, I'm not experienced enough to lead a data team or even know the best place to start. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out how to shape my role, what to prioritize, and how to set myself up for growth.\n\nI‚Äôm comfortable with Python and SQL and have some exposure to Power BI, but not advanced. Our stack includes AWS, Metabase via PostgreSQL (for reporting to clients/partners or to expose our data to non technical colleagues e.g. customer support). No Snowflake or Spark that I'm aware of. Any data engineering tasks are currently handled by the software engineers.\n\nNote: A software engineer who left some time ago used dbt for a bit and I'm very interested in picking this up, if relevant. \n\nI was given a mix of BAU reporting tasks (client growth, churn rate, performance metrics, etc.) but the CTO gave me a 3-month task to investigate our current data practices, suggest improvements, and recommend new tools based on business needs (like Power BI).\n\nMy ideal plan is to slowly transition into a proper Data Engineering role. I want to take over those tasks from the developers, build a more robust and automated reporting pipeline, and get hands-on with ETL practices and more advanced coding/SQL. I want to add skills to my CV that I'll be proud of and are also in demand.\n\nI'd really appreciate any advice on two main areas:\n\n1. a. What are the most effective things I can do right now to improve my daily work and start shaping the data?\n\nb. How do I use the currently available tools (PostgreSQL, Metabase, Python) to make my life easier when generating reports and client insights? Should I try to resurrect and learn dbt to manage my SQL transformations?\n\nc. Given the CTO's task, what kind of \"wrong practices\" should I be looking for in our current data processes?\n\n2.\na. How do I lay the foundation for a future data engineering role, both in terms of learning and advocating for myself?\n\nb. What should I be learning in my spare time to get ready for data engineering tasks (i.e., Python concepts, ETL/ELT, AWS courses)?\n\nc. How do I effectively communicate the need for more proper Data Engineering tools/processes to the higher-ups and how do I make it clear I want to be doing that in the future?\n\nSorry for the long post, and I'm aware of any red flags you see as well, but I need to stay in this role for at least a year or two (for my CV to have that fintech experience) so I want to make the best out of it.

That makes sense operationally ‚Äî but it creates a disconnect because business users don‚Äôt care about processing time; they care about event time.\nTo complicate things further, it‚Äôs also recommended to keep your bronze layer append-only and handle deduplication downstream.\nSo, I have three main questions:\n1. How would you approach partitioning in the bronze layer under these constraints?\n2. How would you design an efficient deduplication view on top of the bronze layer, given that it can contain duplicates and the business only cares about the latest record?\n3. Given that there might be intermediary steps in between, like dbt transformations when going from bronze to gold. How do you partition data in each layer so that your pipeline can scale? \n\nIs achieving idempotentcy and deterministic behavior at scale a huge challenge? \n\nI would be grateful if there are any resources on it that you can point me towards too? \n\n",

Should I just pick one setup method and roll with it, or does the \"right\" choice actually matter?\n\nAlso, if Airflow is this complicated to even get started with, should I be looking at Dagster or Prefect instead as a beginner?\n\nWould really appreciate any guidance because i'm so lost and thanks in advance",

        "content": "Hey looking for some direction on Data factory extraction design patterns. Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all. Can someone please give me some insights on modern techniques if my suspicions are correct? ",

        "content": "\nSo we're going to have a baby in a few weeks, and I was thinking obviously how can I use my data skills for my baby. \n\nI vaguely remembered I saw a video or read an article where someone, somewhere said that they were able to predict their wife's delivery time (with few minutes accuracy) based on accurately measuring contraction start and end times, as contraction lengths tend to be longer and longer as the delivery time approaches. After a quick Google search, I found the video! It was made by [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7q0Y2W0Rn4) 7 years ago, but somehow I remembered it. If you look at the [chart](https://youtu.be/k7q0Y2W0Rn4?si=vz_S1LCIsLeYs10v&t=275) in the video, the graph and trend lines feel a bit \"exaggerated\", but let's assume it's true.\n\nSo I found a bunch of apps for timing contractions but nothing that provides predictions of the estimated delivery time. I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lbrp5f/oc_attempt_to_duplicate_steve_moulds_graph_for/) created 5 years ago, but the blog post describing the calculations is not available anymore. \n\nAnyway, I tried to reproduce a similar logic & graph in Python as a Streamlit app, [available in GitHub](https://github.com/vmatt/predict-my-baby). With my synthetic dataset it looks good, but I'd like to get some real data, so I can adjust the regression fitting on proper data. \n\nMy ask would be for the community: \n1. if you know any datasets that are publicly available, could you share with me? I found an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201517), but I'm not sure how [can this](https://www.physionet.org/lightwave/) be translated into contraction start and end times. \n2. Or if you already have kid, and you logged contraction lengths (start time/end time) with an app from which you can export into CSV/JSON/whatever format, please share that with me! Also sharing the actual delivery time would be needed so I can actually test it. (and any other data that you are willing to share - age, weight, any treatments during the pregnancy)\n\nI plan to reimplement the final version with html/js, so we can use it offline.\n\nNote: I'm not a data scientist by the way. Just someone who works with data and enjoys these kinds of projects. So I'm sure there are better approaches than simple regression (maybe XGBoost or other ML techniques?), but I'm starting simple. I also know that each pregnancy is unique, contraction lengths and delivery times can vary heavily based on hormones, physique, contractions can stall, speed up randomly, so I have no expectations. But I'd be happy to give it a try, if this can achieve 20-60 minutes of accuracy, I'll be happy.\n\nUpdate: I want to add, that my wife approves this",

        "content": "Hey guys, looking for feedback on a potential setup. For context, we are a medium sized company and our data department consists of me, my boss and one other analyst. I'm the most technical one, the other two can connect to a database in Tableau and that's about it. I'm fairly comfortable writing Python scripts and SQL queries, but I am not a software engineer.\n\nWe currently have MS SQL Server on prem that was set up a decade ago and is reaching its end of life in terms of support. For ETL, we've been using Alteryx for about as long as that, and for reporting we have Tableau Server. We don't have that much data (550GB total), and we ingest about 50k rows an hour in batched CSV files that our vendors send us. This data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned up before a database can ingest it.\n\nWith the SQL Server getting old and our renewal conversations with Alteryx going extremely poorly, my boss has directed me to research options for replacing both, or scaling Alteryx down to just the last mile for Tableau Server. Our main purposes are 1) upgrade our data warehouse to something with as little maintenance as possible and 2) continue to serve our Tableau dashboards 3) make ad-hoc analysis in Tableau possible for my boss and the other analyst. Ideally, we'd keep our costs to under 70k a year.\n\nSo far I've played around with Databricks, Clickhouse, Prefect, Dagster, and have started doing the dbt fundementals courses to get a better idea of it. While I liked Databricks's unity catalog and time travel capabilities of delta tables, the price and computing power of spark seems like overkill for our purposes/size. It felt like I was spending a lot of time spinning up clusters and frivolously spending cash working out the syntax.\n\nClickhouse caught my eye since it promises fast query times, it is easy enough to set up and put together a sample pipeline together, and the cloud database offering seems cheaper than DBX. It's nice that dbt-core can be used with it as well, because just writing queries and views inside the cloud console there seems like it can get hairy and confusing really fast.\n\nSo far, I'm thinking that we can run local Python scripts for ingesting data into Clickhouse staging tables, then write views on top of those for the cleaner silver + gold tables and let Alteryx/analysts connect to those. The tricky part with CH is how it manages upserts/deletions behind the scenes, but I think with ReplacingMergeTrees and solid queries, we could get around those limitations. It's also less forgiving with schema drift and inferring data types.\n\nSo my questions are as follows:\n\n\n* Does my approach make sense? \n* Are there other products worth looking into for my use case?\n* How do you guys evaluate the feasibility of a setup when the tools are new to you?\n* Is Clickhouse in your experience a solid product that will be around for the next 5-10 years?\n\n\nThank you for your time.",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nAssume I got a huge dataset of crawled internet webpages, and I'd like to transform them page by page doing some kind of filtration, pre-processing, tokenization etc. Let's say that original dataset is stored along some metainformation in form of parquet files in S3.\n\nComing from enterprises, I have some background in Apache ecosystem as well as some older Big Tech MapReduce-kinda data warehouses, so my first idea was to use Spark to define those transformations using some scala/python code and just deal with it in batch processing manner. But before doing it \"classic ETL-style\" way, I decided to check some more modern (trending?) data stacks that are out there.\n\nI learned about Modal. They seem to be claiming about revolutionizing data processing, but I am not sure how exactly the practical usecases of data processing are expressed in them. Therefore, a bunch of questions to the community:\n\n1. They don't provide a notion of \"dataframes\", nor know anything about my input datasets, thus I must be responsible for somehow partitioning of the input into chunks, right? Like, reading slices of parquet file if needed, or coalescing groups of parquet files together before running an actual distributed computation?\n\n2. What about fault-tolerance? Spark has implemented protocols for atomic output commit, how do you expose result of a distributed data processing atomically without producing garbage from restarted jobs when using Modal? Do I, again, implement this manually?\n\n3. Is there any kind of long-running data processing operation state snapshotting? (not saying about individual executors, but rather the application master) If I have a CPU intensive computation running for 24 hours and I close my laptop lid, or the initiator host dies some other way, am I automatically screwed?\n\n4. Are there tweaks like speculative execution, or at least a way how to control/abort individual function executions? It is always a pity to see how 99% of a job finished with high concurrency and last couple of tasks ended up on some faulty host and take eternity to finish. \n\n5. Since they are a cloud service - do you know about their actual scalability limits? I have a computation CPU cluster of \\~25k CPU cores in my company, do they have some comparable fleet? It would be quite stupid to hit into some limitation like \"no more than 1000 cpu cores per user unless you are an enterprise folk paying $20k/month just for a license\"... \n\n6. Also, them being non-opensource also makes it harder to understand what exactly happens under the hood, are there any open-source competitors to them? Or at least a way how to bring them on-premise to my company's fleet?\n\nAnd a more generic question ‚Äì has any of you folks ever tried actually processing some huge datasets with them? Right now it looks more like a tool for smaller developer experiments, or for time-slicing GPUs for seconds, but not something that I would use to build a reliable data pipeline over. But maybe I am missing something. \n\nPS I was told Ray also became popular recently, and they seem to be open-source as well, so will check them later as well.",

But in a way such a way that, if you or someone edits the text down the road, it won't mess up the annotations and stuff like that?\n\nI don't know much about linguistic annotation software (saw [this brief overview of some options](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/text-annotation-labeling-tools/#1-labellerr)), but what I've looked at so far are basically these:\n\n- [Perseus Greek Texts](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0227) (click on individual words to lookup)\n- [Prodigy demo](https://demo.prodi.gy/?=null&view_id=pos_manual) (on of the text annotation tools I could quickly try in basic mode for free)\n- [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/articulus) (double click to visit terms anywhere in the text)\n\nBut the general problem I'm getting stuck on in my head is what I was saying, here is a brief example to clarify:\n\n- Say we are working with the Bible text (bunch of books, divided into chapters, divided into verses)\n- The data model I'm considering at this point is a tree of JSON basically, `text_section` can be arbitrarily nested (bible -> book -> chapter), and then at the end are `text_span` in the children (verses here).\n- Say the Bible unicode text is super messy, random artifacts here and there, extra whitespace and punctuation in various spots, overall the text is 90% good quality but could use months or years of fine-tuned polish to clean it up and make it perfect. (Sefaria texts, open-source Hebrew texts, are super-super messy, tons of textual artifacts that could use some love to clean up and stuff eventually over time... for example.).\n- But say you can also annotate the text at any point, creating probably \"selection_ranges\" of text within or across verses, etc.. Then you can label or do whatever to add metadata to those ranges.\n\nProblem is:\n\n- Text is being cleaned up over say a couple years, a few minor tweaks every day.\n- Annotations are being added every day too.\n\nEdge-case is basically this:\n\n- Annotation is added on some selected text\n- Text gets edited (maybe user is not even aware of or focused on the annotation UI at this point, but under the hood the metadata is still there).\n- Editor removes some extra whitespace, and adds a missing word (as they found say by looking at a real manuscript scan).\n- Say the editor added `Newton` to `Isaac`, so whereas before it said `foo    bar <thing>Isaac</thing> ...   baz`, now it says `foo bar <thing>Isaac</thing> Newton baz`.\n- Now the annotation sort of changes meaning, and needs to be redone (this is a terrible example, I tried thinking of what my mind's stumbling on, but can't quite pin it down totally yet).\n- Should say `foo bar <thing>Isaac Newton</thing> baz` let's say (but the editor never sees anything annotation-wise...)\n\nBasically, trying to show that, the annotations can get messed up, and I don't see a systematic way to handle or resolve that if editing the text is also allowed.\n\nYou can imagine other cases where some annotation marks like a phrase or idiom, but then the editor comes and changes the idiom to be something totally different, or just partially different, whatever. Or splits the annotation somehow, etc..\n\nBasically, have apps or anyone figured out generally how to handle this general problem? How to not make it so when you edit, you have to just delete the annotations, but it somehow smart merges, or flags it for double-checking, etc.. Basically there is a lot to think through functionality-wise, and I'm not sure if it's already been done before. It's both a data-modeling problem, and a UI/UX problem. But mainly concerned about the technical data-modeling problem here.",

The issue I am facing is since the query result is large, I am running out of memory. I tried using `--quick` command with `mysql` client to get the data row wise, instead of all at once, but I did not notice any improvement. On average, 1 Million rows seem to be taking 1GB in this case.\n\nMy idea is to stream the query result data from the Mysql DB Server to my Script and then once it hits some number of rows, I gzip and send the data to S3. I do this multiple times until I am through my complete result. I am looking to avoid the limit/offset query route since the dataset is fairly large and limit/offset will just move the issue to DB Server memory.\n\nIs there any way to do this in bash itself or it would be better to move to Python/R or some other language? I am open to any kind of tools, since I want to revamp this, so that this can handle atleast 50-100 million scale.\n\nThanks in advance",

        "title": "Real-time Data Analytics at Scale: Integrating Apache Flink and Apache Doris with Flink Doris Connector and Flink CDC",
        "author": "ApacheDoris",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In large-scale data analytics, balancing speed, flexibility, and accuracy is always a challenge. Apache Flink and Apache Doris together provide a strong foundation for real-time analytics pipelines. Flink offers powerful stream processing capabilities, while Doris provides low-latency analytics over large datasets.\n\nThis post outlines the main integration patterns between the two systems, focusing on the **Flink Doris Connector** and **Flink CDC** for end-to-end real-time ETL.\n\n# 1. Overview: Flink + Doris in Real-time Analytics\n\n**Apache Flink** is a distributed stream processing engine widely adopted for ingesting and processing data from various sources such as databases, message queues, and event streams.\n\n**Apache Doris** is an MPP-based real-time analytical database that supports fast, high-concurrency queries. Its architecture includes:\n\n* **FE (Frontend):** request routing, query parsing, metadata, scheduling\n* **BE (Backend):** query execution and data storage\n\nTogether, Flink and Doris form a complete path:  \n**Data Collection ‚Üí Stream Processing ‚Üí Real-time Storage ‚Üí Analytics and Query**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5xktumi95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=58bff724160508aa3b65d27668013b2451af496c\n\n# 2. Flink Doris Connector: Scan, Lookup Join, and Real-time Write\n\nThe **Flink Doris Connector** provides three major functions for building data pipelines.\n\n# (1) Scan (Reading from Doris)\n\nInstead of using a traditional JDBC connector (which can hit throughput limits), the Doris Source in Flink distributes read requests across Doris backend nodes.\n\n* The Flink JobManager requests a query plan from Doris FE.\n* The plan is distributed to TaskManagers, each reading data directly from assigned Tablets in parallel.\n\nThis distributed approach significantly increases data read throughput during synchronization or batch analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm11w5nm95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de75abee5e481cc1816edb4f5a794450eaf78e1\n\n# (2) Lookup Join (Real-time Stream + Dimension Table Join)\n\nFlink supports joining streaming data with dimension tables in Doris.\n\n* **Traditional JDBC Lookup** performs synchronous single-record queries, which can easily become a bottleneck under heavy load.\n* **Flink Doris Connector** introduces **asynchronous batch lookups**:\n   * Incoming events are queued and processed in batches.\n   * Each batch is sent as a single `UNION ALL` query to Doris.\n\nThis design improves join throughput and reduces latency in stream‚Äìdimension table lookups.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3xrn78p95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9b83137da211f91dde0ad32c19c003b8acbe03\n\n(3) Real-time Write (Sink)\n\nFor real-time ingestion, the Connector uses Doris‚Äôs **Stream Load** mechanism.\n\n**Process summary:**\n\n* Sink initiates a long-lived Stream Load request.\n* Data is continuously sent in chunks during Flink checkpoints.\n* After a checkpoint is completed, the transaction is committed and becomes visible in Doris.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5d7rmut95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4c308903f6902c398ebd4b0f152fbcb4aac98a\n\nTo ensure **exactly-once semantics**, the connector uses a **two-phase commit**:\n\n1. Pre-commit data during checkpoint (not yet visible)\n2. Commit after checkpoint success\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1nwzo2w95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fa327670b871eb62744b05a96fc454ef2d2c1\n\n**Balancing real-time and exactly-once:**  \nBecause commits depend on Flink checkpoints, shorter checkpoint intervals yield lower latency but higher resource use.  \nThe Connector adds a **batch caching mechanism**, temporarily buffering records in memory before committing, which improves throughput while maintaining correctness (idempotent writes under Doris primary key model).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lattav7x95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=26943c7358c98e9dc2dcd0076861d23f80083524\n\n# 3. Flink CDC: Full and Incremental Synchronization\n\n**Flink CDC (Change Data Capture)** supports both initial full synchronization and continuous incremental updates from databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n\n# (1) Common challenges in full sync:\n\n* Detecting and syncing new tables automatically\n* Handling metadata and type mapping\n* Supporting DDL propagation (schema changes)\n* Low-code setup with minimal configuration\n\n# (2) Flink CDC capabilities:\n\n* **Incremental snapshot reading** with parallelism and lock-free scanning\n* **Restartable sync** ‚Äî if interrupted, the task continues from the last offset\n* **Broad source support** (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6564nl0z95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=93dbfd850c5765db605dd97613c1dc9a3f42e64a\n\n# (3) One-click integration with Doris\n\nWhen combined with the Flink Doris Connector, the system can automatically:\n\n* Create downstream Doris tables if they don‚Äôt exist\n* Route multiple tables to different sinks\n* Manage schema mapping transparently\n\nThis reduces configuration complexity and speeds up deployment for large-scale data migration and sync jobs.\n\n# 4. Schema Evolution with Light Schema Change\n\nDoris recently added a **Light Schema Change** mechanism that enables millisecond-level schema updates (add/drop columns) without interrupting ingestion or queries.\n\nWhen integrated with Flink CDC:\n\n1. The Source captures upstream DDL operations.\n2. The Doris Sink parses and applies them via Light Schema Change.\n\nCompared to traditional methods, schema change latency dropped from over 1 second to a few milliseconds, allowing continuous sync even during frequent schema evolution.\n\n# 5. Example: Full MySQL Database Synchronization\n\nA full sync job can be submitted via the Flink client, defining:\n\n* Flink configurations (parallelism, checkpoint interval)\n* Table filtering via regex\n* Source/Sink connector parameters\n\nThis setup allows syncing entire databases to Doris with minimal configuration effort.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o0fii32a5vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0960520b54b0432925a13584963929566966db2b\n\n# 6. Summary\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Flink Doris Connector** supports parallel reading, async lookup joins, and exactly-once real-time writing.\n* **Flink CDC** provides lock-free incremental sync, automatic table creation, and DDL propagation.\n* **Light Schema Change** in Doris enables near-instant schema updates with no downtime.\n\nThe combination of Flink and Doris offers a practical, open-source approach to real-time data integration and analytics at scale.",

I have tried using iceberg_scan method by creating a secret before that as I cannot provide my aws credentials like access_id_key, etc in my code (as it is a safety breach). I know there are other methods too like using the pyiceberg library in python but I was not able to understand how that works exactly.\nIf anyone has any suggestions or insights or any other methods that could work, please let me know, it would be a great help and I would really appreciate it.\nHope everyone‚Äôs doing good:)\n\nEDIT- I was able to execute the code using iceberg_scan successfully without facing any errors.\nNow my senior said to look into using glue catalog for the same thing, if anyone has any suggestions for that, please let me know, thanks :)",

        "author": "echanuda",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know this isn't a sub specifically for technical questions, but I'm really at a loss here. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nDisclaimer that this problem is with delta-rs (in Python), not Delta Lake with Databricks.\n\nThe project is simple: We have a Delta table, and we want to update some records.\n\nThe solution: use the merge functionality.\n\n    dt = DeltaTable(\"./table\")\n    updates_df = get_updates()\n    \n    dt.merge(\n        updates_df,\n        predicate=(\n            \"target.pk       = source.pk\"\n            \"AND target.salt = source.salt\"\n            \"AND target.foo  = source.foo\"\n            \"AND target.bar != source.bar\"\n        ),\n        source_alias=\"source\",\n        target_alias=\"target\",\n    ).when_matched_update(\n        updates={\"bar\": \"source.bar\"}\n    ).execute()\n\nThe above code is essentially a simplified version of what I have, but all the core pieces are there. It's quite simple in general. The delta table in `./table` is very very large, but it is partitioned nicely with around 1M records per partition (salted to get the partitions balanced). Overall there's \\~2B records in there, while `updates_df` has 2M.\n\nThe problem is that the merge operation balloons memory **massively** for some reason. I was under the impression that working with partitions would drastically decrease the memory consumption, but no. It eventually OOMs, exceeding 380G. This doesn't make sense. Doing a join on the same column between the two tables with duckdb, I find that there would be \\~120k updates across 120 partitions (there are a little over 500 partitions). For one, duckdb can handle the join just fine, and two, it's working with such a small amount of updates. How is it using so much? The partitioned columns are `pk` and `salt`, which I am using in the predicate, so I don't think it has anything to do with lack of pruning.\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this or the solution is glaringly obvious (never used Delta before), then I'd love to hear your thoughts. Oh and if you're wondering why I don't use a more conventional solution for this - that's not my decision. And even if it were, now I'm just curious at this point.",

        "author": "W_lFF",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "It's actually very good. I really enjoy how they make programming and computer science seem fun and simple, the professor is very good at explaining concepts no matter how difficult or unfamiliar they are. Things like memory management in C or data structures and algorithms were very easily explained, David Malan (the professor) is a very energetic and enthusiastic teacher but he explains his thoughts very clearly, he does a very good job at explaining these concepts visually and conceptually. Things that I was scared of getting stuck on became very simple once they were explained, David Malan is a very good teacher.\n\nI also really enjoyed the problem sets. They were very well made and thought out, they're not too easy like some of the other coding courses that say things like \"print hello world\", \"create a variable and print it\", no with CS50 every problem set is a mini-project(s). It's not too hand-holding like other courses where it feels like you're following instructions instead of building, no you get an explanation, you get a demo of how the final product should look, sometimes you get a short walkthrough or some hints, but at the end of the day it's all about you seeking the answer yourself and working through the problem. Some problem sets are unique and fun like I really enjoyed Fiftyville and Readability.\n\nExpanding on the last point, I really like how they focus on the problem solving aspect of programming.  As a developer you don't get paid to code but to solve problems. I really enjoyed how they didn't encourage AI to write code or to be the main source of learning, no they really want you to read documentation, research and do rubber duck debugging, they encourage figuring things out yourself and that is such an important skill to learn.\n\nAnother thing I enjoyed was how easy their tools were to use. Just make a Github account and connect it to the CS50 codespace. They document and explain their tools like submit50 and check50 very well. I think that if tomorrow you start CS50 and it's your first day programming, it would be very straightforward to get started with the CS50 tools.\n\nNow, the course isn't particularly easy, simple and easy aren't the same thing. If you have no experience with computer science then CS50 could be a bit difficult at first since they get you up and running QUICK, I mean they start talking about algorithms and memory management by around week 3 and 4 and so yeah this is definitely not a course that I would say is \"easy\", but the professor is very good at explaining concepts and if you just stay consistent and you keep going it'll be worth it. It actually gets easier from week 6 and onwards, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a great course. Heck, I wouldn't even be mad if this course costed money. If you're thinking of taking an easy to follow, free, fun course full of learning opportunities then I think CS50 is great, there is not really much of anything that I disliked, everything was super straight forward and simple.",

What I don't understand I ask AI to explain to me in other words, or as if it were to a child *(works like a charm)*. These are very useful for myself since it's how I learn best, but I wanted to know how others learned this skill.\n\nSo, how did you learn / are learning programming? What do you do to keep disciplined? How has your journey been ever since you started?\n\n>!*Non-Important Information: I'm learning C# and just recently got to Methods, Parameters, Return Values, etc. My goal is to understand the basics of programming to only then start actually making a game. I'm also aware of the other parts of Game Dev such as art and sound design, but that's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it.* !<\n\n  \nEdit: Thanks for all the replies.

I think it has a lot more to do with the economy and business side of things than it does with \"capabilities\".\n\nGetting a job has never been about \"yo, i can build advanced and cool software!!\" and yet people put too much emphasis on technologies and what can now be done almost as if the entire tech industry is one giant competition about who can do what the best.\n\nSo is AI really to blame here? Just seeking clarification. And if my take on the subject does matter, I would say it is important to be more business-oriented so you can understand the value you bring to companies because at the end of the day that is why we get hired. Nobody hires someone so they can have a salary. You just gotta prove to them that you are worth the investment.\n\nThese are just my thoughts but if I am wrong please do correct me :)",

I never had an internship during university, and now every entry-level posting seems to ask for experience that I just don't have. \n\nAll I have are my university projects and a few personal ones, but they don't seem to be enough to even get an interview. Job searching has honestly been overwhelming, and I'm starting to feel really lost about what to do next. \n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice on how to break into the industry without prior experience, I'd really appreciate it. Any reply helps - thank you for taking the time to read this. ",

        "author": "Classic_Stomach3165",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to make a function that assigns note names to musical scales which are represented by binary numbers. For example, the expected output for a scale 1001011100101 with a root of F would be F Ab Bb B C Eb F (for musical theory reasons).\n\nTo do this I wrote a recursive function that attempts different scale spellings and returns the one with the lowest cost (e.g. F G# G## Bb Cb C C### F should have a higher cost). However I'm struggling with the recursion as its assigning unexpected costs to certain notes.\n\nSpecifically at the calculate cost section (line 41). The function returns \\[('F', 0), ('Ab', 0), ('Bb', 0), ('Cb', 0), ('Dbb', 3), ('Eb', 0), ('F', 0)\\]). However I'm not sure why Cb has a cost of 0 and Dbb has a cost of 3. I would like them to be B and C which should have lower costs than Cb and Dbb.\n\nThe idea behind the helper functions NameScalesEnharmonicRoots and NameScalesKeySignatures are to try different enharmonic roots (e.g. F# and Gb) for a scale and return the one with the lowest cost and to try to fit scales to key signatures to try to be accurate with music theory.\n\nAre there any recursion gurus who can help me out?\n\nHere is my code:\n\n    def NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode):\n        keys = ['C','C#','Db','D','D#','Eb','E','F','F#','Gb','G','G#','Ab','A','A#','Bb','B']\n        #

I have barely any programming experience and have only done basic Python. But the workload of C++ my father is pushing is constant, he doesn't teach me C++ or even try to work through the assignments, just gives me a due date and a google doc and says to ask ChatGPT if I need help.\n\nMy code is usually an ugly amalgamation of AI-generated nonsense and my best attempt at C++ that is impossible to get working. He only gives me enough time to make something that vaguely fills the assignment requirements much less works much less I actually understand what I'm writing. I genuinely want to learn to code but I don't have the time for much else on top of school and all the C++ projects. My father doesn't explain pointers or compiling or anything and I'm just very lost but I don't have the time to learn on my own while still completing his assignments. I'm currently doing CS50x from edx but its been difficult to progress on top of everything else.\n\nHe's a software engineer but doesn't seem to understand that coding doesn't come naturally for some people. The most recent assignment was I was given a week for an advanced C++ ecosystem simulation of different environment regions, predators, prey, random chance, etc all reading from a configuration file; I don't even know how to write a basic calculator in C++ without help.\n\nIf anyone has learned programming/C++ in a similar manner by 'doing' or has any suggestions for how I can actually learn please comment! I would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

Basically, there's an \"Events\" section which features a bunch of links to Current and Past Events that the club has hosted and clicking on any of them takes you to a dedicated event page. All of the event pages have more or less the same structure. \n\nI can't imagine having to create pages for each of them manually and then route them all to individual endpoints; it sounds very backwards. I mean, there's no way the guys at Youtube are hand-crafting pages for each of it's videos on the database and then manually connecting a million routes. So what's the solution here?\n\nI heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?\n\nAlso, what to do if I wanted to add some unique flair to some of the event pages (but not all) while still maintaining most of the structure? (Say for example, one event page has a different background colour than the rest, or has a few divs here and there that the others don't have)   \nWould I be able to customise without having to break out of the system?",

No other tech stacks regardless of what the project is. Example of when this irked me a little, this last week I had to implement AI into one of the projects to read and automate docs. I wanted to use OCR, and felt like having a simple fastAPI server would've been beneficial as there are many great python packages to handle exactly what I needed but I was told to do so with react, of which packages to handle pdfs were hard to come by and many didn't support OCR from pdfs on react. It would also be nice to use other stacks and see where they benefit.\n\nI have tried other companies but I don't have a degree and every response I get is that I either need a degree or a few years of professional experience and I honestly don't believe that I'm getting that kind of experience with my internship",

I do it and it shortens the codebase significantly\n* That reused snippet doesn't do one single thing but several things, like\n   * uses http client to perform apicall external service\n   * extracts json, validates it\n   * stores some value from json to redis\n* So here we can see 3 responsibilities in single function with explicit logic. So it violates single responsibility principle.\n* I can't even come up with relevant name for that function and end up with something like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` which is bs name. I know it and I can't help myself.\n* According to that principle I should not only split this function to 3 smaller ones. I do it. And function names are good.\n* But what should I do with old one? Let's assume I keep it so now it transformed to chain function. All it does is just calls 3 new functions consecutively.\n* But hey, now old function still does 3 things, not 1. So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.\n* But hey, now we lose in reusability.

I don't know if anything like I described exists, but I've seen long-ass videos of people tinkering with or hacking rare/old electronics and explaining what they're doing and why and those are fascinating and informative, so hoping I can find something similar for programming! \n\nThanks! If you know some in a different language than Python that fits do tell me that one too.

Okay, fine whatever. Then came the \"vibe coding\" initiative. As if we don't have enough inexperience on our teams due to constant layoffs, we're now actively encouraging people to make mistakes and trust AI for the sake of speed. Healthcare company by the way (yikes).\n\nWhat happened to actually knowing things? When will people realize AI is frequently, confidently wrong? I feel like an insane person shouting on every company survey and in every town hall meeting to get these AI-pilled people to understand the damage they are doing. We have people introducing double-digit numbers of defects on single user stories now, and those people don't get in trouble (meanwhile I'm a bad person because I didn't talk to AI last week, for shame!). \n\nI have been applying to dozens of jobs, but every job I apply to is now a game of appeasing an AI reading my application. Of course the market just being crummy in general at the moment doesn't help. Most of the job postings are in developing AI tools that won't be around a year or two from now when they inevitably flop. I'm sure there are companies out there that aren't buying into the AI hype or are just too small to necessitate them, but they seem few and far between.\n\nI'm realizing I have such an appreciation for the critical thinking and problem solving aspects of the career, but as it changes I'm falling out of love with what it is becoming. I feel like I'm on The Truman Show when having to listen to these AI-pilled people. What's your approach to dealing with this? I'd love to hear perspectives from my fellow anti-AI/skeptics.

        "content": "I‚Äôm a junior software engineer (9 months in) at a Series B cybersecurity startup with around 60 people.\n\nHonestly, my experience here has been kind of bizarre, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is a normal experience.\n\nI‚Äôm in a small team that reports directly to the CEO: one senior engineer, me, and an intern. The CEO is technically our manager, but he‚Äôs basically a ghost. He gives no technical direction or help. When I ask for guidance, he just says, ‚ÄúAsk other engineers,‚Äù but they‚Äôre in completely different departments and have no idea what I‚Äôm working on. So we all just work in isolation on our own little projects. There‚Äôs no code review, no real communication, and QA is all manual.\n\nThe CEO keeps saying that since we‚Äôre a small team, we have to be ‚Äúextra vigilant‚Äù and document everything ‚Äî but that‚Äôs about the extent of his input. The funny part is, on the rare occasions when he does try to manage us, he becomes super micromanagey, nitpicking tiny details and trying to control everything. It‚Äôs weird because 95% of the time he‚Äôs totally absent, and then suddenly he swings to the complete opposite extreme. Some days I literally have nothing to do because he doesn‚Äôt assign new tasks.\n\nThere are times when I get completely blocked because I don‚Äôt have the resources or information I need. When I mentioned that to the CEO, he told me that I was ‚Äúblaming others‚Äù and that I should be more proactive. There was also this one time during our monthly progress meeting when our senior engineer fell behind on something because she was waiting for an API from another department. The CEO got frustrated and the two started arguing each other for a good minute or so about it.\n\nMy biggest concern is this: Most of the projects I‚Äôve done are small ‚Äî maybe 2,000 to 3,000 lines of code at most. They feel more like college projects than production systems, and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre even worth putting on my resume. Sure, I have learned a few things here and there ‚Äî Docker/K8s, Nginx with PM2, VM provisioning, shell scripting, a bit of frontend deployment but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm not getting enough solid experience to grow. I‚Äôve been studying 2‚Äì3 hours every night and 5 hours on weekends just to make sure I don‚Äôt fall behind.\n\nIs this kind of situation normal for early-career engineers at startups?",

Passed their tech interview and I got an offer, but the main hangup is the salary. They will likely not offer me any more than I'm already making. So I'm weighing between my current 2 choices, with their own pros and cons. \n\nCompany A (Current company)\n\n- Currently making $115k. They've been decent about raises so far, so I'd expect to reach 120-125 within a year. \n\n- Java + spring backend, angular frontend. We're a big company, so we have a lot of structure and systems setup. Docker + kubernetes, deployment pipelines, etc. I prefer this stack since it seems like most companies in my area use java + spring. \n\n- I like my current team and manager. No conflicts, we get along well, and my manager is a tech guy so he understands what I do and how to support me. \n\n- Benefits are pretty great, huge 401k match and a lot of PTO. \n\n- The main downside is it's 5 days in office. Yeah, it sucks. It's a 30 min commute so it's not as bad as some others, but it's not great when we used to be 2 days in office before. This is the reason I'm looking elsewhere. \n\nCompany B (Who sent the offer)\n\n- .NET/C# backend, React frontend, and a lot of SQL (we don't use SQL at company A). Mostly Microsoft based tech stack. \n\n- Would probably offer me 115k, but unlikely to see raises afterwards. \n\n- 4 days remote, 1 day in office, and the office is 5 minutes away. This is by far the biggest benefit. \n\n- The team seems good, but they're super small. They're down to 2 devs, the tech lead and another mid level developer. No indication on if they'll hire more. \n\n- They're not a startup, but they're midsized. Not as structured as company A, but also nowhere near the same amount of red tape. \n\n\nWhat would you do in my position?",

My mortgage and housing expenses is 40% of my budget, food is 20%, that doesn't leave much to even get ahead. I have a small 3 bed 1 bath in a poor neighborhood and I'm looking to move for a better school district and my budget is aimed at the worst houses in the market. My wife is disabled and a stay at home mom so I only have 1 income and I'm dealing with health issues myself that makes me not on top of my game.\n\nI studied hard 8 months last year for big tech jobs but when I went to apply I put in apps to all big tech companies I only got Amazon responding and I failed their initial screening due to it being a design problem rather than leetcode. Even tried applying to jobs that weren't big tech and don't get a call back.\n\nI could do a business or at least a micro saas for income but I have too much idea paralysis before starting. I could make anything with software and I make great  full stack software but I don't have a GREAT idea for an undeserved market. \n\nI could specialize in a field in CS but I am a .NET/go dev with some full stack experience. I could go to a different field like cyber sec or data engineering but I don't know a good list of ones that pay more than software development. \n\nI am regarded as an up and comer in my organization and work well and hard, but I am underutilized and underpaid. They also don't have a lot of promotion cycles so I don't feel I'm getting promoted as quick as my skills. I should hit senior level within a year or so.\n\nTLDR\nJust feeling lost at the moment. I feel starting a business is the only way to get uncapped salary but get stuck with idea paralysis and undeserved markets. I studied hard at a good university and graduated magna cum laude but I just feel stuck like I learned all that for nothing. Not utilizing enough of my skills at work and not getting paid enough and no calls back from jobs. With 60% of my pay going to a small house and food (not to mention medical bills) its tough to get ahead. ",

Honestly, getting a \"noreply\" is better than having your information sold and being contacted for the hundredth time by some random sales associate (usually speaking broken English with a generic pitch).\n\nThat brings me to the subreddit in question. The first post I came across was this one:  \n[Software Engineer - HTML/CSS/JS @ Apple | $120K‚Äì$210K | Paid Relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit/comments/1o1dgrx/software_engineer_htmlcssjs_apple_120k210k_paid/)\n\nIt struck me as incredibly generic and out of touch. I left a comment for future readers because the post felt vague ‚Äî basic HTML/CSS/JS skills, sky-high compensation, and no real details on location, employment type, or expectations. Most legitimate job postings include more concrete requirements. When they don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs usually a red flag.\n\nOut of curiosity, I reached out to one of the mods, who also claims to be the creator of the sub. While the conversation was polite, almost every question I asked was either dodged or brushed off. From what I could gather, they're scraping job listings from various sources, rewriting them into more digestible formats, and then notifying the companies afterward.\n\nWhen I asked if they had any process to clean up expired or inactive roles, how the employers are notified, or if they could post the sources for these scraped jobs, the conversation was cut short. Shortly after, I received a permanent ban from the subreddit. That, to me, is a bad sign.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt planning to apply through them anyway. I highly doubt Apple is scanning Reddit for job applicants based on comments and quick pitches. But I do care that people might be getting taken advantage of without realizing it.\n\nThe job market is already stressful enough. The least we can do is call out shady practices when we see them.\n\n**TL;DR:** The subreddit r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit posted a sketchy-looking Apple job with vague requirements and high pay. I asked the mod some basic questions about sourcing and expired listings, got vague answers, and was banned shortly after. Feels like they're scraping jobs and repackaging them with little transparency. Be cautious, this looks more like a traffic funnel than a legit job board adjacent.",

I have experience with java and spring, databases (SQL and non-sql), event systems like rabbitmq/Kafka, rest/graphql, docker, kubernetes, maven/gradle. These are most of the things I do on a day to day basis. Throw in testing (junit, mockito, testcontainers) and observability/tracing tools like kibana/datadog/grafana.\n\nBut when I apply to positions I am asked all of the above and way more. Most jobs are listed as full stack, so they require experience with angular/react. Then they want cloud experience, which is very vague imo. Do they expect you to set up ec2 instances and manage load balancers? They also want DevOps experience, but that doesn't stop at k8s/docker, throw in some helm, terraform, setup clusters from scratch if possible.\n\nAt the end of the day most of these positions seem like 3 or 4 people into 1. They want a backend engineer, a frontend one, a DevOps and sometimes even a tester/IT/infra.\n\nAnd I know those are wishlists but while applying and interviewing, I actually get asked about all these things and even get denied if I don't have experience with them. Is this the new normal? Am I just not versatile enough? The project I work on does not allow me to have experience with all these other things things, and I want to know if you would expect someone to know all of these when working.\n\nAnd to specify: I'm not applying to startups where I understand its more expected to be a one man team.",

My new manager was promoted and I was placed under him. My old one is skip manager. I was having lunch with my manager and he laughed when I said I was busy. Eventually in a meeting with him, he snaps at me and tells me to ‚Äúthink!‚Äù. I was scared and confused. Keep in mind that I have Autism and severe anxiety. Usually, I get moved to a new project every sprint and have to deliver on time or else. I didn‚Äôt really have anyone available to help if I needed them, just a few minutes of explanation on a good day. I was hesitant since I began asking for ADA 6 months prior. I decided to call again and got my ADA approved for 60 days for Autism. I told my manager that I had ASD and would experience memory lapses under enough anxiety. He told me, ‚Äúyou can over come it.‚Äù He glanced at the paper explaining my condition and didn‚Äôt keep it. 5 days later he puts me on pip and detailing poor code quality. I was shocked. He himself approved those PRs and no one else found issue with it. When I requested pip papers, he gave it to me a month later without the pages of code he showed me. My anxiety skyrocketed to a point where I took extra days off and time to recover from. He never talked to me like the others in the office, and left me out of many team meetings. He puts me on one project where I had to do big data work when my strength was backend. The POC I needed to sign off my work kept changing the solutioning for the data and my ASD brain went into overdrive to make sure I could grasp it. That took 4 weeks. I was struggling with my mental health and updated my mid year a little late. My manager only based my mid year on those 4 weeks only. Shortly after I got very ill and lost a loved one in an accident. My manager told me to compartmentalize. Day 60 into the 90 pip, I ask him for more work since I‚Äôve completed the recent work on time. He told me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working hard to find you work.‚Äù He moved our 1:1 meeting to 4:30. Once I show up to the meeting he said that I showed little improvement and had security escort me out the office. I never saw or heard from HR once. No severance, just out on the street. The ADA expired weeks ago and I was going to reapply once I saw my doctor again. I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong. I pushed myself past 100% trying to do as he asked. I compartmentalized and dedicated most of my free time to rest until work the next morning. What did I do wrong? He asked me to quit my black employee resource group, I skipped time with family, and put in an extra few hours on some days to ensure perfect code. I don‚Äôt know what I did to disappoint them. My mind would shutdown from exhaustion, but I was on medication to push me past 100%. I‚Äôm at home now recovering before I seek my next job. It was my first tech job out of college 2 YOE.",

I completely dropped applying for jobs ever since I got this current position because it genuinely just made me depressed every day, but with full time right around the corner and finding out full time genuinely is just worse in this pay with barely any pay bumps, I want to start looking for better software engineering positions out there. So here's my question: how do I start again?\n\n  \nHere's where I am at right now. I already rebuilt my resume, updated my LinkedIn and GitHub to match my current experience, and I have a personal website I already included on my resume and attach on any application. My previous internship had be working on Backend JavaScript most of the time, and my current place utilizes php, python, and CRM development whenever I'm doing programming stuff. I really prefer C# and JavaScript. Admittedly I have not worked on a personal project in a long time, but I intend to work on some C# related projects soon. Where should I be looking for positions? Is it still LinkedIn, or is there a better option? Are there any programming languages that are high in demand right now that I should focus on instead? Should I use a different version of my resume each time I apply for anywhere? I've been out of the game for a while, and I know it's only gotten worse. I'm wondering what my next step should be now that I at least have something worth a damn to put on a resume, or if I should just abandon ship and use my experience for something adjacent.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For context, I attend a T50 school in the US in my locality, in a major East Coast metro area, and am double-majoring in CS and DS. Some roles I've been applying to include the usual Software Engineer / Developer roles of all stacks, Data Scientist, Data Analyst and the few database-specific roles that pop up, and even QA, Business Analyst, and various IT roles (that I'm probably woefully unqualified for anyways since I have 0 IT experience).\n\nLet's say the absolute worst happens, and no company hires me for any role between now and my graduation this coming May. In that case, I'd be forced to either become a NEET (and maybe even officially register for some form of unemployment), or (slightly less undesirably) end up in some retail or service job - something that doesn't require a CS degree - just to have *some* work.\n\n**What's the likelihood I'd end up in this situation? And if I do, what's the likelihood I'd ever be able to escape?**\n\nNow obviously, that's a pretty terrible fate to end up in long-term. So I think I'd need some form of \"game plan\". I've already worked some of these before as a student, and some of my older coworkers there have been \"failed\" students in non-CS STEM fields.\n\nAnd since I wouldn't want to work there forever, I'd likely still be applying to \"real\" jobs on the side, and maybe even landing a few interviews if I'm fortunate, but things might not improve, and could even worsen. This current \"employer's market\" might last for a while (I heard for civil engineering it took nearly an entire decade), and unfortunately, it's possible my skills and degree could risk atrophying in the meantime. And this could kill my motivation to do LeetCode / side projects, etc.\n\nAnd what the hell are you even supposed to tell the hiring team if you do get an interview for a tech position? \"I couldn't find work out of college so I had to work at the local grocery store / restaurant\"? How are you going to convince the hiring managers to consider you over some other cracked junior who has *not* needed to resort to menial labor in order to make ends meet or prevent a career gap?\n\nAt what point should I simply admit defeat? At what point do I seriously consider reskilling into non-tech roles? (I'm already having trouble with even \"adjacent\" roles like DA and BA.) Which non-tech roles, even? I don't think I'd be able to break into law, medicine, nursing, or most trades, and even if I could, I don't think I'd have the requisite interest.\n\nFor the sake of discussion, my definition of \"winning\" would be to have enough money to move out of my parents' house in the suburbs and rent an apartment somewhere major enough for me to have a satisfactory social and romantic life. Doesn't have to be 6 figs, FAANG, or even a SWE role at all. Don't even have to actually do it, just have to *make enough money to do it*, and if the job is really local I could just spend ~1-2 extra years at home and save the earnings to be frugal.\n\nYou cannot do this by stocking shelves or flipping burgers for $15/hour. And if I'm forced to care for ailing parents on that salary while their home - the home I grew up in - goes to rot, then oh boy, things are *not* going to be pretty.",

The company itself is not a tech company, but in an entirely different industry/sector. Their tech team is small, and apparently a majority of the time I would be working on would be these Power Apps.\n\nIs this something if I take on, and do for years, would this look bad on my resume?

Moreover, would you move across the country to accept a job like this? I want to feel confident that I won't regret making a large life and career decision based on something that wasn't what I was looking for.

Maybe you're one of them? \n\nParadoxically I've heard of doctors and dentists who became programmers but never about programmers who became doctors. Once saw a Ted talk of a MD who does some coding.\n\n",

Today I handed my notice in.\n\nMy line manager told me he would double my salary to get me to stay. Then immediately after asked me what number I would need to stay. I told him I would need to think about it and we agreed to talk tomorrow.\n\nI make pretty good money already so, obviously even double is a lot of money. However, I'm not a fan of the owners and feel there is little job security there. But, short term I would gain a lot of money quickly. Without lifestyle changes I could easily save/invest an extra ¬£2000 a month.\n\nOn the other side is the defence company and the stability that brings. I get to work on cool stuff and have a solid engineering company on my cv. It's much more of a long term investment, however, my salary remains the same (with some great benefits) but my rent essentially doubles and cost of living also increases because I have to relocate for it.\n\nSo, boil it down to big money at a start up that's pretty much run on vibes and feelings or less money at a big corp but a much more solid career track?",

I already have 1.5 years of college done (my basics) so that will give me more time to focus on what I actually want to pursue as a career. Ever since middle school, I have decided I wanted to pursue computer science and since the ending of last year, I have decided I want to major in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and minor in cybersecurity. However, anytime I tell someone I want to major in computer science I get negative comments such as ‚Äúthat‚Äôs unemployment ‚Äú or ‚ÄúAI is going to take over that field‚Äù and that is just making me overthink and second guess what I want to do. I feel like majority of those people simply don‚Äôt know exactly what computer science is though and they have no idea what they are talking about but it still has me concerned. So my question to everyone on here is (if you are taking comp sci right now or particularly those who already have a career in the field) should I still pursue this field? Is it worth it? What exactly do you do? Do I have anything to worry about? ",

Are you constantly switching between technology and random jobs like KFC worker?  Do you sometimes move across the country from your family, pay for your own apartment, and work there and send money home if you can‚Äôt find work? Is there a degree or niche you found that made you constantly employable in your area and if so, how do i find what that skillset would be for my area? \n\nMy fear is not being able to just be a stable adult. Like if one day I have kids they have to deal with daddy being in Nebraska for two years and visiting every 4 months because he couldn‚Äôt find a dev job in his state. What type of life is that? \n\nI‚Äôve gotten multiple certs and no one seems to care.

I would love to do this type of work, especially looking into and being able to influence AI/AGI safety.\n\nMy background: I have a PhD in aerospace engineering that looked into modeling spacecraft trajectories using machine learning. I moved with my wife for her work to an area that has no aerospace opportunities around (southeast Michigan), and there are virtually no remote opportunities in the aerospace industry, so I've been trying to find a role as an ML engineer instead. I graduated in May 2022, then after 5 months of no luck I ended up taking an IT role at a small company where I had a personal contact because it paid pretty well and bills needed to be paid. This January I was laid off and since then I've been trying to find a position as an ML engineer or more generally as a software engineer. Previously I had 5 internships, 2 of which were ML-based. My PhD and internships primarily used Python and MATLAB, and recently I've been developing a project in C++ to learn that as well.\n\nTheoretically, how would I go from where I'm at with basically 0 relevant YOE to landing a top AI job?",

        "author": "ColorfulWay",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey r/cscareerquestions,\n\nI'm looking for a reality check and some guidance on what roles I should be targeting. I feel like I was sold a bit of a dream and am now trying to figure out the most realistic path forward.\n\nMy Background:\n\n* Education: I graduated in May 2024 with a B.S. in Business Analytics and Information Systems (GPA: 4.0). I'm now in a Master's program for Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics, expecting to graduate in May 2026.\n* \"Buzzword\" Degrees: Honestly, both my bachelor's and my current master's feel like \"buzzword\" degrees. I was told they would open doors to roles like Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer, etc.\n* Coursework So Far: My master's coursework has included:\n   * One machine learning course (we didn't have to write the code ourselves).\n   * One statistics course using R.\n   * One course on C# and full-stack web development using the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core MVC framework.\n   * A course on AWS cloud services.\n   * A software testing course.\n   * Two SQL courses, one specifically on data warehousing.\n* Skills & Projects: I have experience with Python, R, SQL, C#, and JavaScript. I've worked with Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow on the data science side. My projects include:\n   * Developing a full-stack [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core MVC web app to track nuclear outages using a RESTful API.\n   * Building a fake news detection tool in Python using NLTK and Scikit-learn, where I tested models like SVM and Logistic Regression.\n   * Designing and implementing a healthcare data warehouse in Oracle SQL.\n\nMy Dilemma:\n\nFrom reading this sub, it seems like the high-end roles I was told about (SWE, MLE, AI Engineer) are nearly impossible to get without a traditional CS degree, especially at the MS or PhD level. My degrees are from a business school, and I'm worried that pigeonholes me.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n1. Is my perception correct? Are roles like SWE, ML Engineer, Data Scientist, or Data Engineer realistically out of reach for me?\n2. Should I pivot and focus primarily on Data Analyst or Business Analyst roles, or is it realistic to target Data Engineer and Data Scientist roles as well?\n3. If I aim for DA/BA, or even DE/DS roles, what should I be doing right now to be a strong candidate upon graduation? Are there specific skills I'm missing or should double down on (especially for DE/DS)? What kinds of projects would make my resume stand out for these different roles?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",
