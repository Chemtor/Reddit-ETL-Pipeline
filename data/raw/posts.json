        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering  👋\n\nI’ve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that’s always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built [ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.\n\n# So, how does it work?\n\nToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.\n\n# Connects to everything\n\n* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!\n* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.\n* Any API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even internal APIs)\n\n# Why you'll love it\n\n* **Zero configuration:** Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.\n* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g.\n   * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`\n* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.\n\nIf you’re building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!\n\n**Docs:** [https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)\n\n**GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)\n\nA ⭐ on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

With open source, we’d likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:\n\n⁠- flexible server scaling based on demand\n- potentially lower costs\n- more flexibility in how we handle different workloads\n\nOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be super helpful as we’re evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",

The constant context-switching to answer simple questions for marketing, sales, or product folks was a huge drain on my productivity.\n\nSo, I started working on a side project to see if I could build a better way. The result is something I'm calling DBdash.\n\nThe idea is simple: it’s a tool that lets you (or your less-technical stakeholders) ask questions in plain English, and it returns a verified answer, a chart, and just as importantly, the exact SQL query it ran.\n\nMy biggest priority was building something that engineers could actually trust. There are no black boxes here. You can audit the SQL for every single query to confirm the logic. The goal isn't to replace analysts or engineers, but to handle that first layer of simple, repetitive questions and free us up for more complex work.\n\nIt connects directly to your database (Postgres and MySQL supported for now) and is designed to be set up in a few minutes. Your data stays in your warehouse.\n\nI'm getting close to a wider launch and would love to get some honest, direct feedback from the pros in this community.\n\n\\*   Does this seem like a tool that would actually solve a problem for you?  \n\\*   What are the immediate red flags or potential security concerns that come to mind?  \n\\*   What features would be an absolute must-have for you to consider trying it?\n\nYou can check out the landing page here: [https://dbdash.app](https://dbdash.app)\n\nIt's still in early access, but I'm really keen to hear what this community thinks. I'm ready for the roast!\n\nThanks for your time.",

The challenge is that I don’t have a university degree or any formal training in the field. Everything I know, I learned through hands-on experience and self-study. I’m solely responsible for the BI area at my company (with basic support from an assistant), and the company has an annual revenue of around R$1.2 billion.\n\nRecently, I developed a full Power BI solution from scratch — handling everything from data extraction and organization to visualization — to monitor the entire operation of our distribution center, which I’ll be presenting next week. I have basic knowledge of SQL and Python, and I’m particularly interested in the technical and organizational aspects of working with data.\n\nMy current role is Junior Analyst, but I’ll be evaluated for a promotion to Mid-level in October. I started in this field just over two years ago, from absolute zero, as an assistant. About a year ago, the specialist in our department resigned, and even though I was still an assistant, I stepped up to take on the role. It was very challenging at first, but over time I managed to handle the workload and deliver results. According to my manager, I’m expected to be promoted to Specialist by October 2026. Even without a formal degree, I’ve been able to solve the challenges that come my way.\n\nI’m 27 years old now, and I sometimes feel a bit late to start college. That’s why I’d like to hear your advice on the best path to land a Data Engineering position abroad. I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ve been studying and improving my skills, and I feel comfortable with the language. Thank you very much for your time and guidance.",

The challenge is that my analytical, direct approach is what made me good at the technical work, but it's not translating well to the business side.\n\nI've tried some of the usual suspects (Toastmasters, generic communication courses) but they all feel like they're designed for sales people or public speakers, not engineers. The advice is either shallow (e.g. pace, filler words) or in theory (e.g. DISC framework) which doesn't really help when your brain is wired to solve problems efficiently.\n\n**For those who've successfully made this transition - what actually moved the needle for you?** Looking for practical advice, not just \"practice more.\"\n\nAlso, I'm working on something specifically for technical professionals facing this challenge. If you've been through this struggle, would you mind sharing your experience in a quick 8-question assessment? I want to build something that actually helps rather than adds to the pile of generic solutions.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIPaUjV0Okcblh4MVkxF0kPgFww2EVQdYG7\\_cUfxQxR-Z8WA/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIPaUjV0Okcblh4MVkxF0kPgFww2EVQdYG7_cUfxQxR-Z8WA/viewform?usp=dialog)\n\nGenuinely trying to learn from the community here - what worked, what didn't, and what's still missing?",

I believe this tool/webapp can be useful for data engineering devs and teams. I am looking for the communities feedback. To be honest, I have never shared any of my work publicly and I'm a bit nervous.\n\nSo, the way PulseHook works is I have setup an api end point you can use to post from any of your scripts/jobs. You can send success and error status to this API endpoint. Also, you can setup the monitoring on the web app and enter email(s) and/or slack web hooks for notifications. If the api receives a failure status or job doesn't run in the intended duration, notification would be send to email(s) and/or slack. \n\nSo, here is the webapp link - [https://www.pulsehook.app/](https://www.pulsehook.app/) . Currently, I have not setup any monetization and its free to use.

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first).\n\n  \nIn the above case, \n\n1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).\n\n2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.\n\nI want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -\n\n1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).\n\n2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).\n\nI would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).\n\n  \nThank you for reading.",

        "author": "ephemeral404",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).\n\nNow that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.\n\n### What I liked about Pulsar:\n\n* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.\n* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.\n* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).\n\n### What's painful about Pulsar:\n\n* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant\n* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication\n* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debug\n\nWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. \n\nP.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.\n",

I like the role since I get to design, architect and build data products that are really bringing value to the business. I learnt that our company are signing a big contract with this data platform technology. This means more opportunity will be available for me inside the company. And I might transition to other projects after that the current project passes to the run phase. It is honestly exciting however I’m afraid to get locked to this technologie that it is again very niche and technologically speaking less sophisticated than other data platforms like Databricks. It does not yet incorporate lakehouse philosophie/ tools/ data formats for example. The one I’m working on it is more or less a managed spark cluster with many managed niche industry data source connectors.\nAlso, we are early adopters of this data platform but it has been showing a consistent growth signs, for example Aramco is investing on them and is starting to be used by big oil and gas actors.\n\nI want to get your opinion on this situation, and whether you encountered a similar one and what did you do? do you think it’s a good thing to continue working and growing inside my company around this niche data platform or should I get more closer to databricks projects (my company is a big one and some projects are using databricks but much smaller projects with less impact )\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

        "content": "I've been looking for Data Integration Engineer jobs in the healthcare space lately, and that motivated me to build my own, rudimentary data ingestion engine based on how I think tools like Mirth, Rhapsody, or Boomi would work. I wanted to share it here to get feedback, especially from any data engineers working in the healthcare, public health, or healthtech space.\n\nThe gist of the project is that it's a Dockerized pipeline that produces synthetic HL7 messages and then passes the data through a series of steps including ingestion, quality assurance checks, and conversion to FHIR. Everything is monitored and tracked with Prometheus and displayed with Grafana. Kafka is used as the message queue, and MinIO is used to replicate an S3 bucket.\n\nIf you're the type of person that likes digging around in code, you can check the project out [here](https://github.com/bryanbritten/hl7-integration).\n\nIf you're the type of person that would rather watch a video overview, you can check that out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3de54014865b4cb7aa59b87ec940626d?sid=271f23fd-7ade-4f82-864f-e2a288a96a36).\n\nI'd love to get feedback on what I'm getting right and what I could include to better represent my capacity for working as a Data Integration Engineer in healthcare. I am already planning to extend the segments and message types that are generated, and will be adding a terminology server (another Docker service) to facilitate working with LOINC, SNOMED, and IDC-10 values.\n\nThanks in advance for checking my project out!",

The value is different. \n\nWhat's frustrating is we recently started doing design and code reviews but they're useless and implemented in a way it just checks the box while causing the least amount of resistance. A design review is 3-5m and a code review takes about the same amount of time. I joined this company to see how things work with larger teams but unfortunately is also limiting me from helping them more. ",

We can ask for more storage via IT tickets, add compression and look into partitioning for performance. But none of those will really solve the issue in the long term.\n\nI’m wondering a couple of different things here:\n\n1) Does something like Hadoop need to be considered? Is a sql rdms the best opinion for data of this size on-prem?\n\n2) What learning resources to you recommend for understanding how to navigate this kind of thing? The all knowing gpt keeps suggesting designing data intensive applications and the data warehouse toolkit, both of which I have and neither really touches on this.\n\nAnyway, thanks to any on-prem homies who know the struggle and have advice.",

You can also search a pokemon to see the most used build for it. If it is not found in the current months meta report, it will default to the most recent month where it is found (E.g Charizard wasnt in the data set for August, but would show in July).\n\nThis is my first project where I tried to an create and implement ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) into a useable dashboard for myself and anyone else that is interested. I've also uploaded the project to github if anyone is interested in taking a look. I have set an automation timer to pull the dataset for each month on the 3rd of the month - hoping it works for September!\n\nPlease take a look and let me know of any feedback, hope this helps some new or experienced VGC players :)\n\n[https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/](https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/)  \n[https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats](https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats)\n\nTL:DR - Data engineering (ETL) project where I scraped monthly datasets from Smogon to create a dashboard for Top Meta Pokemon (up to top 100) each month and their most used items, moveset, abilities, nature etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz6hr8zwxymf1.png?width=2896&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6b5b6ca15f64665fb72dc98acd4d03d665a7b6\n\n",

This is my first time trying to do something like this so I'm honestly lost on what I should be doing.\n\nIf you’ve solved this problem before, I’d love to hear:\n\n* Which tables/fields you leaned on\n* How you handle attribution and refunds\n* Any pitfalls you ran into with Fivetran’s schema\n* Or even SQL snippets I could copy\n\nNote: This is a small time project I'm not looking to hire anyone to do",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new to data lakes and I'm facing a challenge with data replication.\n\nI've set up a data lake on AWS using S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL, and Athena for queries. I'm using AWS DMS to replicate data from an on-premises Oracle database to S3.\n\nThe problem is with **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. DMS pulls all events from the archived redo logs, including inserts, updates, and deletes. This means my Parquet files in S3 have an `op` column that indicates the type of operation (`I`, `U`, `D`).\n\nFor example, if I query my Oracle database for a specific order with ID `123`, I get a single record. But in Athena, I might get up to 30 records for that same order ID because it was updated many times. Worse, if a record is deleted in Oracle, it still exists in my Athena table, maybe with multiple update records and a final delete record.\n\nEssentially, my Athena table is a log of **events**, not the current **state** of the data.\n\nI've found a temporary fix by adding timestamp and SCN (System Change Number) columns, which lets me write complex queries to find the most recent state. But these queries are huge and cumbersome compared to simple queries in Oracle.\n\nI need a better solution for \"sanitizing\" the data. Parquet files are not designed for easy record deletion. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for this.\n\nHow do you guys handle this?\n\n* Do you just accept the complex queries and leave the old records in S3?\n* Do you run a separate process, maybe an AWS Lambda function, to act as a \"garbage collector\" and delete the older records directly from S3?\n* Do you handle this directly in your ETL jobs (e.g., in AWS Glue)? I'm worried about the cost of this since Glue charges by the minute, and this seems like it would be a very expensive operation.\n\nI'm looking for tips and common strategies for deleting or handling these duplicate/event-based records.\n\nThanks!",

The main goal is to avoid the *small files problem* when storing in **Delta Lake**.\n\nHere’s the flow I’ve come up with:\n\n1. **Raw Layer (JSON / Daily files)**\n   * Store the raw daily files exactly as received from the source.\n2. **Staging Layer (Parquet/Delta per app – weekly files)**\n   * Consolidate the daily files into weekly batches per app.\n   * Apply validation, cleaning, and deduplication.\n3. **Bronze Unified Delta**\n   * Repartition by `(date_load, app_reference)`.\n   * Perform incremental merge from staging into bronze.\n   * Run **OPTIMIZE + Z-Order** to keep performance.\n4. **Silver/Gold**\n   * Consume data from the optimized bronze layer.\n\n📌 My questions:  \nIs this Raw → Staging (weekly consolidated) → Unified Bronze flow a good practice for handling *small files* in daily ingestion with low volume?  \nOr would you recommend a different approach (e.g., compacting directly in bronze, relying on Databricks auto-optimize, etc.)?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I've been working on something called Runcell that I think fills a gap I was frustrated with in existing AI coding tools.\n\n**What it is:** Runcell is an AI agent that lives inside JupyterLab and can understand the full context of your notebook - your data, charts, previous code, kernel state, etc. Instead of just generating code, it can actually edit and execute specific cells, read/write files, and take actions on its own.\n\n**Why I built it:** I tried Cursor and Claude Code, but they mostly just generate a bunch of cells at once without really understanding what happened in previous steps. When I'm doing data science work, I usually need to look at the results from one cell before deciding what to write next. That's exactly what Runcell does - it analyzes your previous results and decides what code to run next based on that context.\n\n**How it's different:**\n\n* vs AI IDEs like Cursor: Runcell focuses specifically on building context for Jupyter environments instead of treating notebooks like static files\n* vs Jupyter AI: Runcell is more of an autonomous agent rather than just a chatbot - it has tools to actually work and take actions\n\nYou can try it with just `pip install runcell`. or find more install guide for this jupyter lab extension: [https://www.runcell.dev/download](https://www.runcell.dev/download)\n\nI'm looking for feedback from the community.

        "content": "Two years ago I had an internship where I had to create a plugin for an existing WordPress website using PHP. I was the only programmer on the team. My supervisor only knew about WordPress styling and the others were working in a completely different sector. I had applied too late for internships and didn’t want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.\n\nThe supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.\n\nNow I’m studying a higher level degree in the same field. It’s something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.\n\nThere is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.\n\nAI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.\n\nLong story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it’s been doing good. It’s like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself. That's also why I chose this path.\n",

There are no test cases or documentation, only vague comments. The variable and function names are mostly nonsensical. Every time a bug occurs, I have to spend hours stepping through the code in debug mode.\n\nHow can I safely refactor code like this?\n\nMy plan is:\n\n**Create test cases**. It's hard to write tests because the expected inputs and code-flow are unknown. To overcome this, I am planning to add detailed logging to the function. The goal is to capture its behavior with various inputs and use those logs to generate a reliable set of test cases.\n\n**Refactor the logic**. Once I have some tests, I can try to reduce the nested if/else statements by extracting logic into smaller methods and using guard clauses.\n\n\nWhat else can I do?

There was always at least one thing to redo better, in terms of consistency, readability or just for a reason they find useful in future while I didn't see it.

Got to know this from gpt)\n\nSo my question is: what am I lacking? Is coding not the right path for me, or can I improve with effort? If I can get better, how should I approach it?\n\nPlease help out a fellow new engineer. ",

The nice part, though, is that working on them has given me a clearer idea of what kinds of classes I actually want to take. I’m guessing some formal education will help solidify the concepts I’ve only kind of pieced together on my own.\n\nThat said, since it’s impossible to know *all* of CS before starting a project, do you ever feel like you end up abstracting concepts the wrong way because you don’t have the formal background yet? I usually just read articles and keep Googling until I get a working understanding of what I need, but sometimes I worry that I’m learning things “wrong.”",

A bit of background: \n\nBack in 2020 I enrolled in a 2-year online university program for web development. We started from the basics like logic, algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode and then moved on to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and React. On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. \n\nIn 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn’t finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. \n\nNow in 2025 I feel like I’m in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don’t know where to start since I’ve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation? I'm also afraid I will rely on AI too much and not learn much at all. ",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI feel pretty lost right now and could use some advice.\n\nI study bioinformatics, and to graduate I need to pass C++ and Python (Data Structures) classes. The issue is… programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.\n\nMy very first programming course happened only after I got  into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck — partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: “I failed this once, I’ll fail it again.” Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.\n\nI actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.\n\nI’ve seen the advice “pick a project idea and use it to learn,” but I’ve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it’s useless to jump into projects if you’re still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.\n\nSo I’m not really looking for project ideas right now — more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I’m really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I’m “too much of a bio/med” to ever be good at programming.\n\nIf you’ve ever been stuck in a similar way, I’d also love to hear your stories — what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.\n\nIt feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors — after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I’m just stuck and don’t want to waste another year circling the same fear.",

I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. \n\nThe protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. \n\nThey wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.\n\nI spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.\n\nWith that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. \n\nMy experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. \n\nI talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: \n\n\"What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?\"\n\nThey even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently \"Eclipse IDE\". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. \n\nAll this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. \n\nI'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock. The protect is in docker containers that I've been trying to get to work for 3 days to no success.\n\nIs this something I should worry about? And is there anything I can do to actually learn things? \n\nI genuinely feel like I should start the career all over again",

However this requires a lot of joins, and im worried its inefficient.\n\nIf it is helpful, i have attached a json style structure of my current setup: [https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18](https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18)\n\nApart from finding a users next lesson, i also need to figure out which lessons have been passed and which are locked. With my current setup i'd somehow need to mark all lessons with a lower order\\_index in the current unit as passed, then all units with a lower\\_order index in that section as passed, and all units and lessons in previous sessions as passed. For this would it be better to just have a status column in the lessons table / append that as part of a lessom dto for the frontend to know?\n\ni hope the issue makes sense, thank you guys so much in advance!",

I had a lot of visual learning because we had a really good teacher who animated algorithms, and explained it really well. I understood the basics so well back then, and I was able to write a lot of basic code and felt like I had a lot of interest toward the subject. So I went ahead and enrolled to study a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Our college had a really outdated syllabus, and would make us write code on paper, and had horrible teachers. The only thing I really kept up with was math. Right after I graduated, I felt shitty about just barely passing what I thought I had interest in. I moved to the US, and enrolled in a UX UI Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and liked what I studied. Learnt some front end development and got a job at a startup, just to get laid off a few months later. After that, I really fell off the bandwagon and never studied. I feel rusty. It's been 2 years since I got laid off, but I am gaining an interest again to learn. I dont know how much the market has progressed, I dont know how much the field has progressed, I dont know where to start, or what to learn. I learn things best visually. \n\nI want to have a step into the door to learn development, and ML, and backend dev. I want to bag a job soon too. \n\nHow realistic does this really sound? IS there any resources you all recommend? Any ways you have done it? I am terrified as much as I am excited. \n\nThanks! ",

        "content": "In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?\n\nThis is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner’s first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it’s simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.\n\nThere are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, there’s the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they’ll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?\n\nThe answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.\n\nSo, the debate is not just “Which language is best?” but also “What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”",

        "content": "Hey guys, I graduated last year with a master’s in cybersecurity but couldn’t land a job (entry level is rough) and realized I don’t even enjoy cybersecurity that much. What I do enjoy is building stuff people actually use — whether it’s a little game, a Chrome extension, a script, or an app, it honestly makes my day when someone says they’re using something I made. Now I’m wondering with all the AI hype and the tough job market if it’s still worth going deep into software engineering, because ideally I’d like to land a dev job (preferably web or mobile) while also launching my own apps on the side. For context, I know Python/JS/C/C++, built some games in Godot, made a Chrome extension and some simple web apps (mainly using django), done a fair bit of LeetCode, and I’m already comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS/SQL. The thing is I’m not sure how to take it to the next level — is it just “keep building projects” or is there more to it? Should I focus on one tech stack, try different ones, or do something structured like The Odin Project even though I already know the basics? Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot. Thank you in advance :)",

I spend about 6-8 hours at work 5 days a week, and then do schoolwork for about 2/3-5 hours a day.

What is the normal amount of experience and skills that I need in order to land an internship. What all do I need to have learned or do I need to put in the extra work to learn more. I see posts saying acronyms and terms that I have yet to learn and feel like there is gaps when it comes to me attempting a software project. Should I put more time aside in order to catch up? I know people say the more serious you are the more work you’ll put in so how far do I need to take that in this situation? \n\nAnd just to add, I do not care to put whatever time aside that I need to, in order to be successful. I’m just having a hard time seeing exactly how much time I do need to be devoting to this and if it is a necessary thing to do, or if more skills and knowledge will come to me as the  school years go on.

        "content": "Hi everyonel I'm looking to step into the world of computer science again after some time away. I apologize if this isn't the right sub to post this, but I've been lurking on here and you guys are very helpful :)\n\nSome context (feel free to skip this paragraph). I've been depressed for a while. Multiple deaths in my family during my years in university. Plus, I started school during the pandemic and still haven't really recovered from the effects of the chaos. Until recently. (I've tried really hard and gotten myself in a much better place. Yay!) But for the last 5 semesters I haven't been able to pass any of my classes. I don't know how they still haven't kicked me out yet haha.\n\nI've learned that I have a very analytical brain. I need to know the how's and why's. I can't operate on theoreticals or vague concepts. I started computer science in uni with no prior knowledge or history with it. I think that's another reason why I couldn't progress with it, because I didn't really even know what it was. The foundations, how it works... But I revisited it recently, and learned the very bare bones of it for the first time. And now I truly feel ready.\n\nI want to approach it differently though. I'm afraid starting classes again would just lead me down the same path I've had these past 5 semesters (ultimately failing). I'm a purpose-driven and visionary individual. I need to have a reason for all that I do. And that's why I believe I'd work really well in a team setting with a goal to work towards to push me.\n\nThat brings me to my question. I'd like to take a semester off. Would anyone know of any externships/ internships/ part-time work/ training/ absolutely anything where I can apply my learning in a professional environment and gain actual valuable real-world experience for tech jobs? Something for first or second year math and comp sci students because I think that's where my proficiency's at at the moment. Something remote. Or if hybrid, then near the Detroit area and even across the border in southern Ontario. On-site is not completely off the table, though not ideal for personal reasons. Unpaid, or paid (wishful thinking haha, but I'm optimistic it's not impossible).\n\nOr if you have ways/ resources I can use to find these kinds of opportunities myself. I really just want a fresh start where I can actually do something purposeful. Thank you all in advance for your help!",

But younger students (18–22) often take it literally and many are deciding not to enter the field at all.\n\nIf AI can’t actually replace developers anytime soon (and it doesn’t look like it will) we’re setting up a dangerous imbalance. Fewer juniors today means fewer seniors tomorrow.\n\nTechnology may move fast but people make decisions with feelings. If this hype continues, the real bottleneck won’t be developers struggling to find jobs… it will be companies struggling to find developers who know how to use AI.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.\n\nThis is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.\n\nThere's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.\n\nI think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nSo many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

Sure enough, I woke up this morning to an email saying they’ve decided to pass on me.\n\nAlso worth noting: most company I’ve spoken to so far has explicitly told me they don’t ask Leetcode-style questions.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.\n\nI can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I’d also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I’d ever stand out in any way.\n\nWhat surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.\n\nThat shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.\n\nI know it’s tough because “just do more tickets” feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.\n\nCurious if anyone else has felt the same? Do you feel like you’re in the grind stage, or have you found other ways to break out of burnout?",

I know this is going to sound strange, but i literally do not know what to study anymore to land a job.\n\nI have been following the standard advice to study LC and SD questions. But on recent interviews, I was not asked a single one of these types of questions. I am not going for F*AANG.\n\nI quite literally have no idea what is expected anymore in interviews. It is all over the place. Some ask hyper specific questions on language syntax that I frankly would never be able to answer without prior knowledge to the questions. Others ask other random stuff.\n\nAlso, because I had to change jobs every couple of years due to layoffs or other reasons, I do not have a expert level knowledge on any one language. I see this as an advantage given that this gives me a wide range of knowledge and perspective on things. But it does hurt me in today's styles of questions to land a job.\n\nWhat should I even be studying for anymore to land a job? You would think I would know given how many times I have gotten a job. But I have never seen it this bad before. Any advice?",

Obviously you can’t be expert on both even though resume clearly shows I’ve delivered and can explain. Interview has become a dice game. I also find that one expert keeps silence over other language expert as they don’t know anything about it and want to maintain their skill set tied to only one coding language.

Sort of things that didn’t matter then suddenly became so significantly important all of a sudden\n\n- Signed a separation agreement, in which it says they’ll pay me 8-week of severance on the next payroll 5 days after my termination date. Last Friday is that date - severance no where to be found\n\n- During the final call with HR, they said they’ll reach out to me with instructions to return laptop and access my paystubs. I’m still waiting for that email. Tried to emailed HR multiple times with no answers whatsoever, it’s like sending email into the void\n\n- Asked HR to reimburse business expense before payroll started, no replies either\n\nSo now I couldn’t contact their HR, still holding onto their laptop, no severance, lost access to paystubs. I thought as a big tech their process would be more standard, this is the totally opposite of that. Wth are these people even doing???? \n\nAnyways, any advice how i can get my severance from them when HR is dead silent?",

A good honest attitude, curiosity, team orientated and leadership experience is very desirable. Add resume items that demonstrate this, not just say it.\n2. Hiring managers are looking for passion and self learners. Show evidence, not just say it.\n3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.\n4. Take contract work to build experience\n5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.\n6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the  organization used that to assess you.\n7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals\n8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.\n9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.\n10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience\n11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.\n12. The market is so tight that experienced devs available and preferred.\n13. Its a numbers game. Most candidates are similar. So just apply a lot and wish for luck!\n14. Apply as close to the posting of the job as possible. Those are considered first.\n15. Know the company well at interview time \n16. Chances are better at smaller companies.\n17. Resumes get 8 secs of attention. Nobody will look at GitHubs. Nobody looks at cover letters. Hiring managers are short on time.",

        "content": "Why can't these recruiters spend maybe just 30 seconds reviewing resumes first before sending the OA email? Instead of wasting applicants' hours preparing and grinding through their OA tasks, only to reject us within a day of submission? Is this some kind of compliance test? If you want to filter people out, can't you just do it the easy way?\n\nI'm tempted to create an open-source list of trash companies that don't respect applicants' time. Likewise, I don't care how prestigious you are - you're a TRASH company to me if you show no respect for applicants' time.\n\n\\--- Update\n\nI might not have explained myself clearly and caused some confusion based on the comments I received. Think about two different recruiting workflows:\n\n1. AI screening -> manual screening -> applicant completes the OA -> interview process...\n2. Applicant completes the OA -> AI screening -> manual screening -> interview process...\n\nThe second approach doesn't make any sense, unless the screening algorithm gives the OA result high weight/priority (even so you can still apply AI screening without OA before the OA). It's a huge waste of applicants' time as they could have been rejected in the first place instead of wasting huge amount of time and energy grinding down the OA tasks. \n\nHowever, AFAIK, it feels like a bunch of companies have implemented their workflow as #2. Why on earth is this? Feel free to correct me if my speculation is wrong.",

        "author": "BananaBerryPi",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.\n\nI started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer.  I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a \"welcome to team\" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. \n\nI waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were \"waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer\", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes \"Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you\". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying \"hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?\". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). \n\nSo... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a \"misstep\" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. \n\nNow... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like \"oh actually, forget that\" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?\n\nHonestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a \"job\" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.\n\nTL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was \"misstep\" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",

As I go through my classes though I'm finding a hard time with getting the motivation to actually code. I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.\n\nMaybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.\n\nSo I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you? At what point do you just shift to something else?",

I also was a member of student association, organizing couple hundred+ events. I mostly worked part time (20h/week). During my 2 years of work. I moved to a team for half a year... and I did not fit. It was a really stressful period during work. Up to that point I felt I was good. After that I felt I had a lot of flaws and was not good. Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.\n\nAnd right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).\n\nSo I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...\n\nI am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.\n\nLately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.\n\nI was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern). It looked like should not work. I wanted to discuss with another colleague... After 10min of the call, I spent another hour to debug the code and check how it functions via tests. It worked well. Messaged the MID dev and I felt I wasted his time.\n\nThese questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...\n\nI just feel I do not get enough work done, I feel somewhat unmotivated and I feel I waste people's time... Now sure how to systematically fix it.",

I’m trying to figure out what makes the most sense for my career long-term:\n\n* Should I return to the same FAANG for another internship?\n* Or should I branch out (another FAANG, startup, something in SF) to diversify my experience?\n\nMy main concern is that if I don’t go back, I lose the direct hiring pipeline into this FAANG. If I do a return internship then securing a new grad role is going to be very easy. On the other hand, the role is in Toronto—so the pay is lower than US offices, and the local tech scene doesn’t compare to SF. Since I’m still early in my career, I want to maximize learning and growth.\n\nI’d love to hear from people who’ve been in a similar position: what did you choose, how did it impact your job search after graduation, and what would you recommend I do with this opportunity?\n\nThanks in advance!",

My ideal route would be to complete my bachelors with a specialization in ML and then get a masters in ML. It’s a field I have been interested in since I can remember but I’m having doubts as to the career prospects both out of my bachelors and after my masters. \n\nThe Canadian job bank in my area has categorized CS as having a “good” job outlook meaning there’s expected growth in the market. I also checked the statistics for CS in California and I was met with a similar outlook despite everything online saying the market is oversaturated and to pivot while you still can. Is this just anecdotal vs statistical evidence or is there something of note there?\n\nIt would suck to give up on CS as I genuinely enjoy it but would it be wise to pivot into something else while I still can? If so what would have good prospects? If I continue with CS how would I go about breaking into the industry with a seemingly disappearing entry point? Are internships my only hope?\n\nCS has kind of been my only plan as it’s what my father does and what I’ve grown up around.",

        "content": "It's been a few months since I graduated and it feels like my job prospects are sharply going down over time. Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.\n\nThe projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any \"real\" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it \"right\" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)\n\nI just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).\n\nI don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",

The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes “shortcuts” to speed up development. Usually they’re hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other’s toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people’s work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.\n\nOn top of that, there’s never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or “needs to be deployed ASAP.” We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it’s not a toy project.\n\nMy concern is that after 7 years, I don’t feel like I’ve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds.

        "content": "tl;dr: [This](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) is the project. The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).\n\nI've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.\n\n* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).\n* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).\n* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).\n* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).\n* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.\n* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.\n\nSo all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**\n\nA lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.\n\nThe project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.\n\nThe problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's \"in Japanese\" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.\n\nI am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about. I want a job, and I want to optimize my personal projects to help me get that job as much as I can. So I'd love some input on whether projects like the one I linked are good fits for that or if I need to shift gears and go another route. I'm totally happy either way, I just really want to know so I don't waste months of my time.",

Learn GenAI / LLM-related development (prompt engineering, integrating LLMs into applications, fine-tuning, vector databases, RAG, etc.)\n2. Double down on my existing backend/dev skills – improve depth in Java/Spring Boot, testing, microservices, system design, cloud-native concepts, Kubernetes, DevOps pipelines, observability, and scaling distributed systems.\n\nHere’s my situation:\n\n* I’m not really interested in GenAI at the moment. It feels like a hype-driven bubble, and I don’t want to learn a stack just because it’s trendy.\n* My main focus has been building solid, scalable backend systems, and I enjoy working in that space.\n* I don’t mind picking up GenAI *if it becomes unavoidable in backend roles*, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin.\n\n  \nTo be clear:\n\n* I am not the type of person who chases the latest tech hype unless it directly benefits my day-to-day work.\n* Even though I am interested in GenAI personally, right now what I want to focus more on is being employable and relevant in the upcoming years as a Java backend developer.\n* I am also focusing on a specific side-hustle which I want to turn around into a full time business in the future, so I don't have the time to pursue/learn something new from the scratch unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Will I be missing out on backend job opportunities now (or in the next few years) if I don’t learn GenAI?\n* Is GenAI integration actually becoming a *must-have* skill for Java/Spring Boot developers, or is it still more of a niche?\n* From a long-term career perspective (5+ years), would I be better off becoming a stronger backend engineer with deep cloud/microservices/devops skills, or should I invest in GenAI sooner rather than later?\n* For those of you working in the industry — are companies actually *expecting* backend developers to know GenAI, or is it more of a nice-to-have skill for specific roles/domains?\n\nI’d love to hear from people in the industry (especially those hiring or working on enterprise systems). Is the future of backend development leaning toward “every backend dev should know AI/LLM integration,” or will strong fundamentals in backend + cloud still carry the most weight ?",

Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.\n\n5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.\n\n6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.\n\n6.

Reassigns work between different team members, also without much information or thought.\n\n8. Seems to be completely oblivious to how these constant disruptions are impacting members of the team (I and other have brought these up personally, and he denied it).\n\n9.

Applied for this IT intern position in late July, went through 2 assessments (probably for pre-screening), didn't hear anything back. Position appeared in co-op portal again a couple weeks ago, so I applied once again. Maybe they offered someone the position and they didn't take the offer. Dunno.\n\nLast week they called me and asked me if I was still interested in the position. No assessment this time, maybe they remembered me from July. Asked me about transportation, location, salary expectations, when I can start (I said next week, September 8th), etc. At the end they said thank you, and that they'd be in touch very soon.\n\nTechnically it's only been like 4 business days since the call, because of the long weekend. But the start date I gave them is approaching and I need to know either tomorrow or Friday so I can cancel my classes. Even then, I'd assume there needs to be some leeway so I can actually accept the offer and they can process that, right?\n\nWondering if it's just a lost cause. I know a lot of the time \"you'll hear from us soon\" is just flavortext and doesn't mean anything. Can I get some insight?",

So anyways, I’m trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.\n\nFirstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I’ve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people’s resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that’s a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that’s something worth sharing or if maybe I’m just not ready yet to be applying to internships.\n\nAlright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I’ve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they’re not very relevant to cs so I don’t wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it’s worth adding? Lmk guys.\n\nThirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help 🙁.\n\nOk thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\nI have 10 years of experience as an SWE (mostly .NET), and I've been through an anxiety train with some personal things and impostor syndrome.\nI was laid off in July and I currently have 2 offers in hand, and another 2 final interviews... so in a sense, im probably not in a that bad situation, 4 chances in 1 month is probably great.\n\nReminder that I am based in Portugal so the salaries will just be lower. Regardless of that I feel like its a good idea to start working as soon as possible to not fill a gap.\n\nOffer 1: 70k in a USA International consulting agreement (4k net for 3 months, drops to 3k net in contract). This would be a B2B contract until the office gets setup here, which in their perspective takes 3 months. This would become a hybrid role 1x per week, but its 300km away. Besides, since its a B2B with absolutely no benefits (no insurance, no PTO, no nothing, just a monthly retainer), I would have to open tax activity and terminate my unemployment salary which I have for another 1.5 years (worth 1.3k month) and I will not get it back if they fire me (which they can for whatever reason since this is California based law with 0 rights for me). I feel this is extremely risky as they can just replace me with an offshore for cheap anytime they want, and the glassdoor reviews seem spammed with fake 5 stars, with 1 star comments actually mentioning the CEOs names.\n\nOffer 2: My ex ex company offered 2k net and its a 2x per week hybrid role, 70km away, which is better. They want me to be a tech lead and grab every backoffice and migrate to a modular monolith, with .NET and React. It is a long term contract, I have been in this company for 6 years and I needed 0 technical interviews to get an offer, just a call to my boss and he straight away gave me a contract and all his plans.\n\nI am thinking of accepting offer 2, even though its lower. My plan is to just have a safety zone and invest my free time: keep doing interviews and grind system design (which I now will in this job) and learn kubernetes.\n\nAm I doing the correct thing to play safe and secure, and jump back to something better if it shows up?",

        "content": "I've had a very eclectic, non-traditional career path, but now I'm at the point where I no longer know how to market myself. I've been interested in and learning how to write code since I was a teenager (currently in my mid thirties.) I've always done little dumb projects for myself, especially after reading Automate the Boring Stuff a while back.  I've picked up a lot of skills in a variety of tech adjacent things along the way: python (django and flask too), javascript, react, typescript, postgres, nosql, a ton of different AWS services (and less experience but still some with both GCP and Azure), cybersecurity, devops, and more.\n\nI'm currently doing freelance full stack development in Typescript and Python, building an MVP of a web app for a client. I've been doing freelance dev work since being laid off last year, and off and on for the last decade. I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. \n\nWhen I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.)    \n  \nAs an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. \n\n  \nAt another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. \n\n  \nI'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. \n\nI also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how I should market myself to stand out?",

This all sounds great but it doesn't really align with my interests.\n\nI initially joined because I wanted to have some experience and I didn't receive any calls from FAANG companies last summer(tried 2-3 positions in Google, 1 Amazon and went on an Optiver interview). The other bonus is that my current team sold the projects as cryptography related, which although not false is hardly the main thing. They ended up liking me though, so I joined as a Junior for my first ever job and was promoted to Mid 5 months later\n\nI'd like to be in a more competitive/challenging scene. This for me means either FAANG or some challenging niches in CS I've found interesting like Quantitative development (and analysis),HFT, 3D graphics\n\nProblem is that there aren't many Quant companies where I live and I don't think my resume is impressive in any way to potential recruiters from there. \n\nThis is where the Research assistant position comes in. I did a few electives after my intro Stats course and my professor liked me a lot, so he invited me to join. It's basically 4 hours a day (which could be tough to pull off, being full time at another job), includes weekly discussions on math topics that are interesting and given that he knows I work full time, he'll be considerate. I don't know for sure, but I don't think academic research in Maths is my calling \n\nQuestion now is whether a position like that would sit well on a CV (perhaps for FAANG / Quant jobs), or if it's not worth the hassle\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and reply!",

I’m currently in the training period, and I’ve realized that this isn’t really the career path I want long term. Most of the work is done in kdb/q, with some Python occasionally. The tasks are mainly developing ETL pipelines, data processing, and monitoring.\n\nI’m wondering how difficult it is to transition into another direction, for example into a Data Engineer role, if most of my professional experience is tied to such a niche technology? Has anyone here made a similar switch, and if so, what technologies would you recommend focusing on?\n\n*P.S.: This was actually my first job offer since the beginning of the year, and there aren’t really any other entry-level positions in my area, so quitting is not an option right now.*",

        "content": "Hi everyone, hope you're having a great day. I won't dilly-dally too much and I'll try to get right to it:\n\nI've recently graduated from college with a BSc in Computer Science. For the past year (exactly 1 year next month) I've been working as Frontend Developer in a super small local company. It's been pretty good and I feel like I've learned a lot. Here's the company setup: my superior/boss is also the only backend developer here (I'm the only Frontend dev) so we work closely together. However, my workload is often determined by the superior's work done (since I can't really do much outside of bug-fixing and optimizations if there's no new features) and for this entire summer it's been close to none.\n\nThis is nice in a sense that I can focus on my personal projects (which I am), but in the back of my mind I'm still worried that I'm stagnating commercially, and I think that especially in these early years of my professional experience I would greatly benefit from mentorship and I could learn a lot from other developers as well. Eventually I would like to climb the ranks etc which is simply not possible here where I currently am...\n\nWhat do you guys think? Start looking to join a big team/company to learn (working in teams, scrum, code-reviews etc) or stay here? Important to note (and a big worry for me), is the fact that my boss is expecting a baby very soon and I know that in that period I basically won't be doing anything again.\n\nAny and all input is appreciated, thank you guys!",

Being in an office staring at a screen straight for 8 hours a day not moving just trying to make the company more efficient in certain areas is already driving me crazy and i realise I want a job where I can actually work with nature or be outside working with technological equipment.\nI've done a little research into technological land surveying and GIS and was wondering if anyone has had success switching a career path with a high level cs degree into one of these areas and what the process is like. \n\nAlso, if there are other technological fields in nature that cs can apply to that may also could be good fits.\n\nGeorgia tech also offers a direct GIS masters program, so I was maybe thinking of doing surveying or some entry level GIS for a year and then applying for that if others have had experience getting a masters degree in this area.\n\nI can't be couped up in this office all day for the next 20 years.\n\n",

        "content": "There was a devops opportunity that I was offered internally by the lead of another department and it was approved. They are not getting anyone to replace me in the other department due to budget constraints. \n\nI've been told it's been approved but I am going to be on a \"trial\" period. I don't know what that entails. I guess to see how I do and then my performance will be evaluated. \n\nHere's the thing, I'm in help desk right now and I guess I'm going to be in the same office for now. I don't really like the idea of that becuase I think that still paints me as \"the help desk\" guy. We have a few people who walk in our office a day instead of making tickets, so should I be expected to help them? Or will that be up to the rest of my department now? I'm the person people go to for a lot of things help desk by default. \n\nI'm not trying to be a pain, but sometimes help desk tasks can take half of my day up, so how can a proper trial be established? Plus I need to do on the job training with Puppet which is what I will be using primarily to do my job. \n\nIt wasn't said to me that I was going to split time, but I really don't want to do that. The other department leader even said I'm going to have a lot on my plate and he doesn't think I can do both. \n\nLike it's going to be awkward if i'm just sitting there and my boss is assigning me help desk tasks while I'm trying to learn puppet. I hope this gets addressed soon. Cause at that point I would be working two jobs.\n\nI guess during the trial I will be technically under my boss but doing the work for the head of another department. The role was offered to me because of my computer science degree and because I was the only one who really took interest in working with puppet.",
