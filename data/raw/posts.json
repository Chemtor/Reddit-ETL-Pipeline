        "author": "soosmagmangos",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi guys! :) I hope it's the right place for this question.\nSo I have a databases and webtechnolgies exam on thursday and it's freaking me out. This is the first and probably last time I'm in touch with databases since it has absolutely nothing to do with my degree but I have to take this exam anyway. So you're taking to a noob :/\n\nI've been having my issues with normalization. I get the concept, I also kind of get what I'm supposed to do and somehow I manage to do it correctly. But I just don't understand and it freaks me out that I can normalize but don't know what I'm doing at the same time. \nSo the first normal form (english is not my mother tongue so ig thats what you'd call it in english) is to check every attribute of a table for atomicity. So I make another columns and so on. I get this one, it's easy. I think I have to do it so I avoid that there aren't many values? That's where it begins, I don't even know what one, I just do it and it's correct.  \nThen I go on and check for the second normal form. It has something to do with dependencies and keys. At this point I check the table and something in me says \"yeah girl, looks logical, do it\" and I make a second or third table so attributes that work together are in one table. Same problem, I don't know why I do it. And this is also where the struggle begins. I don't even know what I'm doing, I'm just doing it right, but I'm never doing it because I know. But it gets horrible with the third normal form. Transitive dependencies??? I don't even know what that exactly means. At this point I feel like I have to make my tables smaller and smaller and look for the minimal amount of attributes that need to be together to make sense. And I kind of get these right too ¡-¡ But I have make the most mistakes in the third form. \nBut the worst is this one way of spelling my professor uses sometimes. Something like A -> B, B -> CD or whatever.  It describes my tables and also dependencies? But I really don't get this one. We also have exercises where this spelling is the only thing given and I have to normalize only with that. I need my tables to manage this. \nMaybe you understand what I don't understand? I don't know why I exactly do it and I don't know what I actually have to look for. It freaks me out. I've been watching videos, asking ChatGPT, asking friends in my course and I just don't understand. At least I'm doing it right at some point. \n\nDo you think you can explain it to me? :(\n\n\nEdit: \nThanks to everyone who explained it to me!!! I finally understand and I'm so happy that I understand now! Makes everything so much easier, I never thought I'd ever get it, but I do! \nThank you <3",

This guide I found really helped me bridge the gap between all the “bookish” theory I’m studying and how things actually work in the real world.\n\nFor example, earlier this semester I was learning about the classic three-tier architecture (moving data from source systems → staging area → warehouse). Sounds neat in theory, but when you actually start looking into modern setups with data lakes, real-time streaming, and hybrid cloud environments, it gets messy real quick.\n\nI’ve tried YouTube and random online courses before, but the problem is they’re often either too shallow or too scattered. Having a sort of one-stop resource that explains concepts while aligning with what I’m studying and what I see at work makes it so much easier to connect the dots.\n\nSharing here in case it helps someone else who’s just starting their data journey and wants to understand data architecture in a simpler, practical way.\n\n[https://www.exasol.com/hub/data-warehouse/architecture/\n](https://www.exasol.com/hub/data-warehouse/architecture/)",

I know Python well, so working in Python for my initial contribution would probably let me focus on understanding the codebase itself rather than struggling with language syntax.\n- I’m attracted to many projects, but my main worry is picking one that’s not regularly used at work—I'm concerned I’ll need to invest a lot more time outside of work to really get up to speed, both with the tool and the ecosystem around it.\n\nProject choices I’m evaluating:\n- dbt-core: My first choice, since we rely on it for all data transformations at work. It’s Python-based, which fits my skills, and would likely help me get a better grip on both the tool and large-scale engineering practices. The downside: it may soon see fewer new features or even eventual deprecation in favor of dbt-fusion (Rust). While I’m open to learning Rust, that feels like a steep learning curve for a first contribution, and I’m concerned I’d struggle to ramp up.\n- Airflow: My second choice. Also Python, core to our workflows, likely to have strong long-term support, but not directly database-related.\n- Clickhouse / Polars / DuckDB: We use Clickhouse at work, but its internals (and those of Polars and DuckDB) look intimidating—with the added challenge of needing to learn a new (compiled) language. I suspect the learning curve here would be pretty steep.\n- Scikit-learn: Python-based, and interesting to me thanks to my data science background. Could greatly help reinforce algorithmic skills, which seem like a required step to understand what happens inside a database. However, I don’t use it at work, so I worry the experience wouldn’t translate or stick as well, and it would require a massive investment of time outside of work\n\nI would love any advice on how to choose the right open-source project, how to balance learning new tech versus maximizing work relevance, and any tips for first-time contributors.\n",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Hi r/dataengineering \n\nWhen building high-performance storage systems, the performance bottleneck in write-intensive scenarios often lies in the in-memory data structures. Traditional MemTables based on Skip-Lists or B-Trees, while excellent at maintaining data order, can become a performance drag under high-concurrency writes due to their complex internal node operations.\n\nTo break through this barrier, my colleague and I designed and open-sourced a brand new, high-performance in-memory KV storage engine: **Columnar MemTable**. It leverages a suite of modern C++17 techniques and clever concurrency designs to achieve astonishing performance. In our benchmarks, its concurrent write throughput reached **\\~17 million ops/s**, 3.5 times that of a traditional Skip-List implementation. Single-threaded batch writes hit an incredible **\\~52 million ops/s**, a 50x improvement over Skip-Lists. In mixed read-write scenarios, its performance soared to **\\~61 million ops/s**, leading by a factor of 4.\n\nThis blog post will serve as a tutorial, taking you on a deep dive into the internal world of Columnar MemTable to dissect the core design philosophy and implementation details behind its high performance.\n\n**Core Design Philosophy: Separate the Hot Path, Process Asynchronously**\n\nThe foundation of Columnar MemTable's high performance can be summarized in one sentence: **Completely separate the write hot path from the background processing cold path.**\n\n* **An Extremely Optimized Write Path:** All write operations go into an \"active block\" (FlashActiveBlock) tailor-made for concurrent writes. At this stage, we don't care about global data order; we pursue the absolute maximum write speed and lowest latency.\n* **Asynchronous Organization and Consolidation:** Once an active block is full, it is \"sealed\" and seamlessly handed over as a whole to a dedicated background thread.\n* **Leisurely Background Processing:** The background thread is responsible for sorting the sealed data, converting its format, building indexes, and even performing compaction. All these time-consuming operations are completely decoupled from the foreground write path, ensuring stable and efficient write performance.\n\n# A Simple Architecture Diagram\n\n[Columnar MemTable Design](https://preview.redd.it/vzchkgjz43qf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74fb77e99e8e0f228c77ed1e8b48ce92e02ee96)\n\nAs you can see, Columnar MemTable is essentially an in-memory LSM-Tree. However, because the MemTable itself has a limited size, it doesn't generate a huge number of sorted blocks (usually just a dozen or so). Therefore, in-memory compaction isn't strictly necessary. My implementation provides a configuration option to enable or disable compaction for in-memory sorted blocks, with it being disabled by default.\n\nNext, we'll dive into the code to break down the key components that realize this philosophy.\n\n**Deep Dive into the Write Path (The \"Hot\" Zone)**\n\nThe write path is the key to performance. We minimize lock contention through sharding and a clever memory allocation mechanism.\n\n**1. Sharding**\n\nLike all high-performance concurrent components, sharding is the first line of defense. ColumnarMemTable maintains an array of Shards. By taking the hash of a key modulo the number of shards, we distribute different keys to different shards, which greatly reduces concurrency conflicts.\n\n        \n      // Locate the corresponding Shard using the key's hash\n    size_t GetShardIdx(std::string_view key) const { \n      return hasher_(key) & shard_mask_;\n    } \n\n**2. FlashActiveBlock: The Core of Write Operations**\n\nAll current writes within a Shard are handled by a FlashActiveBlock. It consists of two parts:\n\n* **ColumnarRecordArena**: A memory allocator designed for concurrent writes.\n* **ConcurrentStringHashMap**: A quasi-lock-free hash index for fast point lookups within the active block.\n\n**3. ColumnarRecordArena**\n\nTraditional memory allocators require locking under high concurrency, whereas ColumnarRecordArena almost completely eliminates contention between write threads by using Thread-Local Storage (TLS) and atomic operations.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Thread-Exclusive Data Blocks:** The first time a thread writes, it's allocated its own ThreadLocalData, which contains a series of DataChunks. A thread only writes to its own DataChunk, avoiding data races at the source.\n* **Lock-Free In-Block Allocation:** How do we safely allocate space within a DataChunk for multiple threads (although by design TLS is mostly accessed by a single thread, we aim for maximum robustness)? The answer is a 64-bit atomic variable, positions\\_.\n   * The **high 32 bits** store the number of allocated records.\n   * The **low 32 bits** store the number of bytes used in the buffer.\n\nWhen a thread needs to allocate space, it enters a Compare-And-Swap (CAS) loop:\n\n        \n      // Simplified core logic of AllocateAndAppend\n    uint64_t old_pos = chunk->positions_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);\n    while (true) {\n        // Parse old record index and buffer position\n        uint32_t old_ridx = static_cast<uint32_t>(old_pos >> 32);\n        uint32_t old_bpos = static_cast<uint32_t>(old_pos);\n    \n        // Check if there's enough space\n        if (old_ridx >= kRecordCapacity || old_bpos + required_size > kBufferCapacity) {\n            break; // Not enough space, need to switch to a new Chunk\n        }\n    \n        // Calculate the new position\n        uint64_t new_pos = (static_cast<uint64_t>(old_ridx + 1) << 32) | (old_bpos + required_size);\n    \n        // Atomically update the position\n        if (chunk->positions_.compare_exchange_weak(old_pos, new_pos, ...)) {\n            // CAS successful, allocation complete\n            record_idx = old_ridx;\n            buffer_offset = old_bpos;\n            goto allocation_success;\n        }\n        // CAS failed, means another thread interfered. Retry the loop.\n    } \n\nThis approach avoids heavyweight mutexes (std::mutex), achieving safe and efficient memory allocation with only lightweight atomic operations.\n\n**4. ConcurrentStringHashMap: A Fast Index for Active Data**\n\nOnce data is written to ColumnarRecordArena, we need a fast way to find it. ConcurrentStringHashMap is designed for this. It's based on linear probing and uses atomic tags to handle concurrency.\n\n* **Tag Mechanism:** Each slot has an 8-bit atomic tag. EMPTY\\_TAG (0xFF) means the slot is empty, and LOCKED\\_TAG (0xFE) means it's being written to. When inserting, a thread first tries to CAS the tag from EMPTY\\_TAG to LOCKED\\_TAG. If successful, it safely writes the data and then updates the tag to its final value.\n* **Lock-Free Reads:** Read operations are completely lock-free. They just need to atomically read the tag and other data for comparison. This makes point lookups (Get) in the active block extremely fast.\n\n**From Hot to Cold: Sealing and Background Processing**\n\nThings get more complex when a FlashActiveBlock reaches its size threshold.\n\n1. **Seal**\n\n* A foreground thread acquires a lightweight SpinLock for the shard.\n* It marks the current active\\_block\\_ as sealed.\n* It creates a new, empty FlashActiveBlock to replace it.\n* It places the sealed block into a global background processing queue.\n* It releases the lock.\n\nThis entire process is very fast, with minimal impact on foreground writes.\n\n**2. Background Worker Thread (BackgroundWorkerLoop):**\n\nAn independent background thread continuously pulls sealed blocks from the queue.\n\n* **Data Consolidation:** It iterates through all the data in the sealed block's ColumnarRecordArena, converting it from a fragmented, multi-threaded layout into a compact, contiguous columnar block (ColumnarBlock).\n* **Columnar Storage (Structure-of-Arrays):** ColumnarBlock stores all keys, values, and types in separate std::vectors. This layout dramatically improves cache locality, especially for future analytical scan queries (OLAP), as it allows reading only the required columns.\n* **Parallel Sorting:** After consolidation, the background thread calls a Sorter (defaulting to ParallelRadixSorter) to sort all records in the ColumnarBlock by key. Radix sort is highly efficient for strings, and parallelizing it fully utilizes multi-core CPUs.\n* **Generate SortedColumnarBlock:** Once sorted, a final, immutable, read-only SortedColumnarBlock is generated. To accelerate future reads, we also build:\n   * **Bloom Filter:** To quickly determine if a key might exist, effectively filtering out a large number of queries for non-existent keys.\n   * **Sparse Index:** We sample a key every N records (e.g., 16). When querying, we first use the sparse index to quickly locate an approximate range, then perform a binary search within that small range, avoiding the overhead of a binary search over the entire dataset.\n\nAs you can see, this SortedColumnarBlock is very similar to a Level 0 SSTable in an LSM-Tree.\n\n**The Complete Query Path**\n\nWhat is the lifecycle of a Get(key) request? It searches through data from newest to oldest to ensure it reads the latest version:\n\n1. **Check the Active Block:** First, it searches in the current shard's FlashActiveBlock using its ConcurrentStringHashMap. This is the hottest, newest data and usually results in the fastest hits.\n2. **Check Sealed Blocks:** If not found, it iterates in reverse through the list of sealed\\_blocks in the shard that have been sealed but not yet processed by the background thread.\n3. **Check Sorted Blocks:** If still not found, it finally iterates in reverse through the list of SortedColumnarBlocks that have been processed. Here, it first uses the Bloom filter and sparse index for quick pruning before performing a precise lookup.\n\nIf the key is not found anywhere, or if the last record found is a Delete type, it returns std::nullopt.\n\nHere, to ensure memory safety, we need to maintain a reference count while searching the Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks to prevent the MemTable from deallocating them. However, incrementing a shared\\_ptr's reference count on the Get path is very expensive and prevents Get operations from scaling across multiple cores. Using raw pointers, on the other hand, introduces memory safety issues.\n\nOur solution uses a **thread-local shared\\_ptr** and maintains a **global sequence number**. When the set of Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks is modified (e.g., a block is sealed), the global sequence number is incremented. When a Get operation occurs, it checks if its locally cached sequence number matches the global one.\n\n* **If they match (the common case)**, the thread-local shared\\_ptrs are still valid. The query can proceed using these cached pointers, completely avoiding an expensive atomic ref-count operation.\n* **If the local number is outdated**, the thread must update its local shared\\_ptr cache and sequence number (a much rarer event). This design allows our Get performance to scale effectively on multi-core systems.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work**\n\nAlthough Columnar MemTable excels at writes and point lookups, it's not a silver bullet.\n\n**Adaptation Issues with RocksDB**\n\nThe current design is not well-suited to be a drop-in MemTable plugin for RocksDB. A core requirement for RocksDB is an Iterator that can traverse all data in the MemTable in sorted order. In our implementation, data in the FlashActiveBlock is unsorted. To provide a globally sorted iterator, we would have to sort the active block's data on-the-fly every time an iterator is created and merge it with the already sorted blocks. This on-the-fly sorting is extremely expensive and completely defeats our write-optimized design philosophy. Therefore, perfectly adapting to RocksDB would require further design changes, such as maintaining some degree of local order within the active block. One idea is to replace FlashActiveBlock with a skiplist, but that would essentially turn it into an in-memory RocksDB (haha).\n\n**Ideal Use Cases**\n\nThe current ColumnarMemTable is specifically designed for scenarios like:\n\n* **Extremely high write throughput and concurrent point lookups:** For example, real-time metrics monitoring, user behavior logging, and other write-heavy, read-light workloads.\n* **In-memory buffer for OLAP engines:** Its native columnar format makes it a perfect in-memory staging area for OLAP databases (like ClickHouse). When data is flushed from memory to disk, it can be done directly in the efficient columnar format. Even while in memory, its columnar properties can be leveraged for pre-aggregation calculations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nColumnarMemTable is an exploration and a breakthrough in traditional MemTable design. By separating the hot write path from background processing and designing highly optimized data structures for each—a thread-local arena allocator, a quasi-lock-free hash index, parallel radix sort, and columnar blocks with Bloom filters and sparse indexes—we have successfully built an in-memory KV engine with outstanding performance under write-intensive and mixed workloads.\n\nI hope this design deep dive has given you some inspiration.

I was never that fascinated by writing sql transformations but rather tooling, optimizations and infra and moved more and more to building platforms for data engineers.\n\nI now have 2 offers at hand (both pay equal). The first one is as a data engineer. I would be the only data guy in a department of 30 people and there is a large initiative to automate some financial reporting. The tasks are building dbt models with Trino. Also building some dashboards which I have never done. I would be responsible which is cool, but the tasks don’t seem to deep. Sure I could probably come up with e.g a testing pipeline for dbt models and implement that on my own to have some technical challenges but that is it. There is a department taking care of all services and development of the platform. I am a bit afraid that I will be stuck in writing pipelines when I take that job and will not be invited to tooling / infra heavy roles.\n\nThe other one is as a platform engineer where I would work in a platform team to build multi cloud K8s microservices and handle monitoring and logging etc. That seems to be more challenging from a technical perspective but I would not be in the data sphere anymore. Do you think a switch back to data / data platform engineering is possible from there. Especially if I continue with open source?",

I kind of envisioned it as a combination of n8n and tableau. Basically you use nodes to connect to data sources, transform data, and connect to ML models and graphs.\n\nIt has 4 main components: A visual workflow builder, the backend for the workflows, a widget-based dashboard builder, and a backend for the dashboards. Each can be hosted separately via Docker.\n\nEssentially, you can build an ETL pipeline via nodes with the visual workflow builder, connect it to graph/model widgets in the dashboard builder, and deploy the backends. You can even easily embed your widgets/dashboards into any other website by generating a token in the dashboard builder.\n\nMy favorite node is the web source node which aims to (albeit not perfectly as of yet) scrape structured or unstructured data by visually clicking elements from a website loaded in an iframe.\n\nI just wanted to share this with the broader community because I think it could be really cool, especially if people contributed nodes/widgets/features based on their own interests or needs.

        "author": "lilde1297",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi. I’ve been doing data engineering for 3 years now and I’m mostly self taught. I am the primary data engineer for my team, which resides outside of IT. My tech stack is currently python scripts running on cron. My IT has a seperate etl stack using SSIS. This is not an SSIS rant. This is an honest inquiry about how to proceed with the situation at my job.  \n\nMy team started using Python before I was hired and to my knowledge without the approval of the dba. I now mange the environment and I am looking to get a modern set up with Airflow running in azure on a couple VMs. The dba is not happy that I don’t use SSIS and I feel kind of stuck since I was hired to write Python anyway.  I’m also watching more people in my organization develop Python skills so I feel like it makes sense for me to align with the skills of the org as a whole. We also just aquired Snowflake and I feel like Python works better with that kind of data warehouse.\n\nNow I do understand some of my dba point of view. My team just did their own thing and he feels that was wrong. I don’t know the whole story as to why things ended up this way and I’ve heard critiques of both IT and my team.   My environment wasn’t setup with the best security in mind. I am working to rectify this but I’ve bumped heads with the dba on a solution because he never feels the security is enough and doesn’t trust me fully. I am trying to run Airflow on azure as I said and my plan is to store anything sensitive in key vault and call the secrets at runtime.   This should be secure enough to get his sign off but that’s to be seen.\n\nNow when it comes to what tool to use(Python, ssis, airflow, etc.) I feel stuck between everyone. On one hand my dba wants to say SSIS and that’s it. I’ve tried SSIS and I prefer Python. If needed I could use SSIS but I’ve brought up other issues such as my dba doesn’t use CI/CD or version control and I think that is very important in a modern setup.  Additionally the dba didn’t have other people on his team who knew and a could support ssis until recently and their still new to it.  On the flip side I know that the dba team doesn’t have any people who know Airflow or Python  so I understand when my dba says that he can’t support Python.  I know there are people outside of that team and IT who do know Python though.\n\nWhen it comes down to it I guess I’m trying to figure out if I’m making the right call and telling my dba that I’m going to use Airflow and make it as secure as possible or should I give in because ssis is what he knows? Also should he even have as much say as he does in the agency data engineering stack when he is the dba and he doesn’t develop the pipelines himself?  \n\nAlso I’d love to hear if any of you have had similiar experiences or are in companies where there are different data engineering stacks that live outside of IT.",

We employ three Lambda functions to extract, transform, and load data in our current configuration. Step Functions manages all of this. The state machine takes all the S3 file paths that come from each Lambda and sends them to the load Lambda as a list. Each Transform Lambda can make one or more output files. The load Lambda understands exactly how to process the files since we control the order in that list and utilize environment variables to assist it understand the file roles. All of the files end up in the same S3 folder.  \nThe problem I'm having right now is that our new Glue task will produce a lot of files, and those files will need to be processed in a certain order. For instance, file1 has to be processed before file2. Right now, I'm using S3 event triggers to start the load Lambda, but S3 only fires one event per file, which messes up the order logic. To make things even worse, I can't change the load Lambda, and I want to maintain the system completely serverless and separate, which means that the Glue task shouldn't call any Lambdas directly.  \nI'm searching for suggestions on how to handle processing files in order in this kind of setup. When Glue sends many files to the same S3 folder, is there a clean, serverless technique to make sure they are in the right order?",

        "author": "IntelligentNet9593",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I recently joined a small research organization (like 2-8 people) that uses several Access databases for all their administrative record keeping, mainly to store demographic info for study participants. They built a GUI in Python that interacts with these databases via SQL, and allows for new records to be made by filling out fields in a form. \n\nI have some computer science background, but I really do not know much at all about database management or SQL. I recently implemented a search engine in this GUI that displays data from our Access databases. Previously, people were sharing the same Access database files on a network drive and opening them concurrently to look up study participants and occasionally make updates. I've been reading and apparently this is very much not good practice and invites the risk for data corruption, the database files are almost always locked during the workday and the Access databases are not split into a front end and back end. \n\n  \nThis has been their workflow for about 5 years though, with thousands of records, and they haven't had any major issues. However, recently, we've been having an issue of new records being sporadically deleted/disappearing from one of the databases. It only happens in one particular database, the one connected to the GUI New Record form, and it seemingly happens randomly. If I were to make 10 new records using the form on the GUI, probably about 3 of those records might disappear despite the fact that they do immediately appear in the database right after I submit the form. \n\nI originally implemented the GUI search engine to prevent people from having the same file opened constantly, but I actually think the issue of multiple users is worse now because everyone is using the search engine and accessing data from the same file(s) more quickly and frequently than they otherwise were before. \n\nI'm sorry for the lengthy post, and if I seem unfamiliar with database fundamentals (I am). My question is, how can I best optimize their data management and workflow given these conditions? I don't think they'd be willing to migrate away from Access, and we are currently at a road block of splitting the Access files into front end and back end since it's on a network drive of a larger organization that blocks Macros, and apparently, the splitter wizard necessitates Macros. This can probably be circumvented. \n\nThe GUI search engine works so well and has made things much easier for everyone. I just want to make sure our data doesn't keep getting lost and that this is sustainable. ",

My concern is that I’ve always seen the DWH as a tool for reporting, not as a centralized source of data from which non-BI applications can be fed, but I can see that doing everything through the DWH might be simpler during the transformation phase rather than creating separate ad hoc pipelines in parallel.",

I wouldn't know if there is as I am new to ADF). \n* I have seen solutions for Zero Copy into Snowflake from Data Cloud but unsure on this as our Data Cloud is not set up.

Airbyte v0.30.1 is installed,  Docker Desktop is running and my local instance of Airbyte appears to be working fine.\n\nI've created the connections to the sFTP server and the local database, and these tested fine in the local Airbyte web UI.  In the logs and Event Viewer, I can also see the Airbyte account logging into the sFTP server without any problems.\n\nI get now stuck in creating the Airbyte Connection in the local web UI - after picking source and target, and sync mode,  it's not showing any schema whatsoever.  Even when I change the Airbyte file source to point to one specific file, it just isn't seeing showing a schema. \n\nI've checked the user account that logs into the sFTP server and it has all the privs it needs.  When I use the same account in WinSCP, I can connect just fine - and I can view, download, rename, delete, move, etc. any file on the sFTP server itself,  so I'm not sure if there's an issue with the sFTP user account privs?\n\nAny idea on why Airbyte cannot read the schema? I've been trying to look at logs in the Docker image but haven't found anything useful yet. \n\nIs there a way to more accurately debug this process somehow?",

If not, please do let me know where you think I should post it. \n\nI will do my best to explain what it is i am trying to achieve \n\nI have a sheet in excel which is used for data and revenue tracking of customer orders\n\nThe information that gets inputted into this sheet eventually gets inputted into Salesforce. \n\nI believe this sheet is redundant as it is the same information being entered in twice and manually, so there is room for errors. \n\nI will mentioned that there are drop down menus within the sheet in excel, which sometimes needs to be changed to a different value depending on the information of the order. However, there are probably only a max of 6 combinations. So really I could have 6 separate sheets that the information would need to go into for each combination if needed.\n\nI am hoping there is a way to extract specific data from salesforce and input it directly into these sheets? \n\nTypically there can be anywhere from 1 to 50 sheets that get made each day. And each sheet contains different information for each specific order. However, the information is always in the same spot within salesforce \n\nI am hoping there is a way to this automatically where I would go through each order in sales force and push a couple of buttons to extract that data into these sheets. Or a completely automated way\n\nI think I have fully explained what it is I am trying to do. But if its not clear let me know. If I am able to achieve this, it will save me so much time and energy! \n\nTIA",

        "author": "homelessleftsock",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nSome background, we have an employee dimension which holds details associated with every employee, imagine personal data, etc. \n\nOur application allows for the clients which have purchased our services to define a custom set of questions/fields, which can be set by their client admin or answered by the employees themselves. This can be a department assigned to an employee by the client admin, or just a question the client admin has defined for their employees to answer, like favourite color during onboarding.\n\nWhat I am struggling with is how to store this custom information in our warehouse.\n\nThe way the data is structured in the operational db is the following EAV:\n\n\t•\tTable A = the dictionary of all possible custom fields (the “keys”).\n\t•\tTable B = the mapping between employees and those fields, with their specific values.\n\nI am unsure if I should create a separate dimension for those custom attributes, which links to the employees dim and hold this information following same EAV pattern (employee id, id of the custom key, custom key, custom value). It will be a 1:1 relationship on the employee id with the employee dimension.\nOr I should just dump this custom data as a JSON column in the employee dimension and flatten when necessary.\n\nWhat also bothers me is that this custom attribute data can get quite large, in the billion of records and an employee can have more than 20 custom fields, so storing it in JSON seems like a mess, however having it stored in an EAV pattern will cause hit on the performance.\n\nLastly, those custom fields should also be accessible for filtering and we might need to pivot them to columns for certain reports. So having to flatten the JSON columns seems like expensive operation too.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and how would you approach this?\n",

From what I have read, in Iceberg there's a functionality called time travel that let you use the exact same query with \"AS OF your_timestamp\" to get the results of the past. It seems to me that it can be useful in generating historical trends over time.\n\nHowever, I also read that in the long term, for example when you have data that spans over years, using time travel to generate historical trends is actually a very bad idea in terms of performance and is an anti-pattern. I also tried asking AIs, which some of them told me it's fine and some of them tell me to look at Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions when building the tables.\n\nI am a bit lost here and some help and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I come from a DevOps background but am getting more and more Data Engineering tasks recently.\n\nI am trying to setup database replication to a data lakehouse.\n\nFirst of all, here are some specifications about my current situation :\n\n* The  source database is configured on relevant tables with a CDC system.\n* The IT Team managing this database is against direct connection so they are redirecting the CDC to another database to act as a buffer/audit step. Before an ETL pipeline will load the relevant data and send files to S3 compatible Buckets.\n* The source data is very well defined, with global standards applied to all tables and columns in the database.\n* The data lakehouse is using Apache Iceberg, with Spark and Trino for transformation and exploration. We are running everything in Kubernetes (except the buckets).\n\nWe want to be able to replicate relevant tables to our data lakehouse in an automated way. The resfresh rate could be every hour, half-hour, 5 minutes, etc ... No need for streaming right now.\n\nI found some important points to look for :\n\n* how do we represent the transformation in the exchanged files (SQL transactions, before/after data) ?\n* how do we represent table schema ?\n* how do we make the correct type conversion from source format to Iceberg format ?\n* how do we detect and adapt to schema evolution ?\n\nI am lost thinking about all possible solutions and all of them seem to *reinvent the wheel*:\n\n* use the strong standards applied to the source database. modification timestamp columns are present in every table and could allow us to not need CDC tools. A simple ETL pipeline could query the inserted/updated/deleted data since the last batch. This would lead us to Ad Hoc solutions : simple but limited with evolution.\n* use Kafka (or Postgresql FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED trick) with a custom Json like file format to represent the CDC aggregated output. Once the file format defined, we would use Spark to ingest the data into Iceberg.\n\nI am sure there as to be existing solutions and patterns to this problem.\n\nThanks a lot for any advice !\n\nPS : I rewrote the post to remove the unecessary on premise/cloud specification. Still the source database is an on premise IBM AS400 database if anyone is interested.  \nPPS : also why can't I use any bold characters ?? Reddit keep telling me my text is AI content if I set any character to bold  \nPPPS : sorry dear admin, keep up the good work",

        "author": "LeekNecessary3190",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've been seeing this question pop up almost every day for a year and a half, and it's always the same old story… 'I'm 17, 19 years old' + 'I feel like college is a waste of money' + 'All I want is to work' + 'How do I become a developer without a degree?'\n\nLet me be honest with you: your chances are very slim. Sure, you can teach yourself everything you need in 3 to 5 years, maybe two if you push hard, and build a good portfolio. But what's your plan to find that dev job? You think you'll ace the technical interviews? Great. But how will you even get those interviews? Your CV, no matter how much you polish and fix it, will look very weak next to someone from a coding bootcamp, not to mention a CS graduate applying for the same entry-level job.\n\nLook, I get you. College is very expensive, and they won't teach you specific job-related things like Vue or Svelte. Many people, myself included, entered this field without a CS degree. But my path wasn't easy. I managed to get dev experience at a company I was already with, and that gave me the two years of experience (2 YOE) required for them to even look at my resume for my current job. And I got that first job because I had a bachelor's and master's degree in a completely different field they happened to need. Even with all that, I sent out about 250 applications, got 3 interviews, and in the end, only one offer. And that single offer came through a referral by pure luck.\n\nThe irony is that you can indeed learn all the required skills for a fraction of the cost and in less than 5 years, thanks to all the amazing online resources available. But if you're about to finish high school and haven't entered college yet, I'm honestly very surprised that some people think skipping college is the 'easy path.' You're not taking a shortcut; on the contrary, you're choosing the hardest path. You're like a salmon trying to swim upstream – a few might make it, but the vast majority won't.\n\nIf you want to gamble with your professional future, that's your decision. You can always try to go to college after you've likely struggled a lot to find your first job. The only thing you'll lose is time, and you can never get that back. I just don't understand why someone would intentionally make it harder for themselves from the start. This field is very difficult to get into.\n\nJust to be clear, this is directed at young people of typical college age who don't have major life responsibilities like children or debt. If you're older – say 26, 31, 36 – and thinking of a career change, this isn't for you. I myself am 38 and just entered this field a few years ago. For us, the calculation is different. But for the young folks, I'm telling you as a self-taught dev: this path is a meat grinder, and I absolutely do not recommend it.\n\nSome people might misunderstand me. I'm not saying you're a lesser person for not having a degree. I'm saying that HR and recruiters will likely filter out your CV and not look at it because there are stronger ones. It's all a numbers game. Imagine a single entry-level job gets 700 applications. Let's say 350 have CS degrees, 250 have bootcamp certificates, and 100 are self-taught. The hiring manager needs to pick 25 or 35 people to interview. Why would they even start with the self-taught pile? From their perspective, it's easier and safer to pull the best CVs from the people with CS degrees. It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks the 'follow your passion' advice is a scam?  \nThis is the title of an [article ](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1nihjhc/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_follow_your/)I came across recently. My opinion is that passion is important, but your education is extremely important. Don't give up your education, which will most likely qualify you for a job, for an uncertain path.  \n",

        "content": "I've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way that I got my start, the way that many of my most talented friends got their start, was not a 16 week boot camp, although I'm not saying there's no value there, having a goal, and moving through each of several key areas in a full stack sdlc, they do well enough. \n\nIf you are trying to learn all the things you need to know in order to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all of those pieces together in your mind, and it can feel like you are learning HTML, but it looks like crap so then you learn CSS, but now it looks good but it doesn't do anything so you learn JavaScript, and now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like react or angular but then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so that it's not hard coded so you learn some back end framework, now you got APIs but you're still hard coding so then you learn how to stand up a database, and all along the way there's all of these choices, decisions  to make,  pros and cons, and it's always changing. \n\nI've went through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on rails, c# and .net, spring boot and Java, the MEAN stack with angular 1, and then angular 2 which was not even the same thing is the first, the MERN stack, All the little frameworks in libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object oriented versus functional or whether it's graphql vs rest, and it keeps changing it keeps going one thing that's simpler the next gets more complicated, and if you don't have some central thing that you can use to glue all these concepts together they come and go and you've never really learned much, you learned kind of how to touch kubernetes one day and then you've never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you do because you are actually on something worse than k8s, but I digress. \n\n\nIf you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice for you after being a software engineer forever is to do these things: \n\n1. Think of the coolest most badass thing that you can think of that you would like to go try and build. \n\n> Take this long as you need here, this is the most important part, it really has to resonate as you know what holy shit I would actually like to build this and you start getting amped about it, that energy is going to get the through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together because you can look back and say oh yeah I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mix-ins combined with the other features of the language I just dropped playing CSS and LESS overnight, oh yeah I've heard of tailwind, I have to have dabbled with it, it's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly, etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.\n\n2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it out of, because I promise you the chances that you are going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea by analysis paralysis is going to be astronomical.\n\n> Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, patterns etc for whatever it is that you're trying to build, I recommend a full stack JavaScript stack or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge on complexity and the learning curve just starting out, mainly because it reduces you having to learn two languages when context switching from the front end to the back end if you're looking to be full stack. People ask me what is the best programming language, and I always just tell them it's the one that you've spent 5 years learning, you can do just about anything was just about any language out there, some of them are hyper specialized like erlang or rust or golang but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share, if it's popular that means that people are hiring for it, it means the people like it and that their support out there for it. Whichever you pick you'll be fine, you're getting an education either way.\n\n3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you\n\n> Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what they're imagined idea of it would look like, until they just start there building out the UI learning how to make a mock-up and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you. \n\n4. You are going to change your mind about things, people who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from 6 months ago and say to yourself what was I thinking here, then you're not growing.\n\n> Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or begin to paralyze because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale so now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12 factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale why you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join, these are just the growing pains, reading there's so much reading out there, there's so many opinions, different patterns different hills that people will die on, pick yours, looks like building out your own custom set of opinions, and I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck, that's the nature of it. \n\n> Lastly if you find that you're passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure that you still want to go on that direction but you're thinking okay there's this whole other direction that actually really cool that's fine, the likelihood that you are going to change is just as likely is the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner, I've not been bored in almost two decades I've been programming, each day it's more the same but nothing of the same, no two days are alike, and you get the express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely, \n\nSo if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build and immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day even if it's just updating the readme every single day until you pick a framework, start building that part of your resume right away, show your active, try to open a pull request on an open source project, go try to build your hacker rank, have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do, it'll make all the world to do this together for you, best of luck to you out there.",

I regret taking that brea cuz Im not gettinf anywhere and everyone from my major is attending master.\n\nEven now, I can’t solve half of the easy LeetCode problems in a reasonable time and barely manage mediums. I applied for a uni project before taking a break, they accepted me and sent a long tutorial to prepare for the interview. I wanted to do it badly, but I procrastinated, got headaches trying to follow the guide lines, and now it’s probably too late.\n\nI’ve started several projects (I enjoyed frontend) but never finished them. Job applications are going terribly, and I score low on logic tests. It makes me wonder if I’m wasting my time. I really want to be a programmer, I want it so badly, but I’m starting to think maybe just maybe I’m not meant to be one, maybe this is not meant for me.

We’re doing capstone now, and if we actually pull it off, we’ll likely have an internship in a few months. Then, if I’m lucky, I’ll probably graduate—but my degree would feel useless because I honestly don’t know what to do with it.\n\nI’ve spent months overthinking what’s next after graduation. I used to love this program—especially web development, dsa with Java, database management, and digital logics—but that was during 1st and 2nd year. I lost motivation because every semester we had to shift into a totally different topic, just after I’d started enjoying the last one. I was at my peak during those years, then crashed hard when the subject switched to things that didn’t interest me, like PHP and all that.\n\nAnyway, now I feel like I’m back at zero, taking a refresher, and I’ve realized that school never really taught us how to actually apply what we learned. They just gave us small projects, and I thought I was doing great—but then I asked myself, “What’s next?” Honestly, I think I’ve learned more teaching myself and watching tutorials than I did in school. But even that hasn’t been enough, because my brain can only take so much information, and I can’t juggle multiple things at once lol.\n\nReality just hit me recently, and now I’m frantically searching for possible careers I could get into with so little knowledge and no real projects to show. Please don’t judge me—I already do enough of that myself. I just really need help and advice: what should I dooo??\n\nPeople have told me to just focus on one thing, and I did—I’ve been learning web development these past few weeks because I used to really like it. But then I see a lot of people saying beginner web developers won’t be needed anymore since AI is already as good as senior devs. Now I’m slacking again, questioning whether web development is even worth studying. I thought it would be a good starter since it’s beginner-friendly, but now I really don’t know what to doooo.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks, everyone! I'll keep your advices in mind.

These little projects were enough to land my first programming jobs.\n\nThings seem to be quite different now. My son will soon approach the teenage period, and with the current state of the industry, I’m hesitant whether it’s worth involving him in this field.\n\nApparently, none of the average HR folks today would get impressed by a similar portfolio. You are supposed to develop an “app” just like “X”, that “solves something”, using the cloud infrastructure of a big corporation and the latest front-end framework, pushed by another corporation. This comes with a significant investment in a particular toolset, and requires heavy scaffolding, possibly assisted with LLMs. On the job market, you are not a “programmer” anymore. You are someone who is familiar with a very narrow set of tools, and need to market yourself accordingly.\n",

Months 7–12 → I build 1–2 serious projects (e.g., a full web app, an app with an interface), put everything on GitHub, and start applying.\n\nWith this path, would I reach a credible junior level?

However, this will result in circular dependency since Buff class knows about unit, and Unit class need to know about Buff.\n\nI could use a interface or abstract class to only expose a certain part of the implementation detail, it still feels messy because the fact that usage is circular doesnt change. I thought of having a external class that owns unit and buffs, so theres no circular dependency, but it doesn't feel satisfying, because logically, unit should own buff because that buff applies to it and itself only.",

        "content": "Hey, I’m a 2nd year Compurer Science student and my studies already take up a ton of time and energy. Most of my day is basically just me sitting behind my laptop grinding through uni work so I can keep my grades up.\n\nAt the same time, I also have the ambition to build my own projects, either to make money from programming or at least to create tools that are genuinely useful to me. The problem is I haven’t even managed to start a project yet. I struggle with discipline and time. After a full day of studying, my brain just feels fried, and at that point I usually need to do something physical instead. I’m pretty active and I love sports, so I go to MMA once a week and try to squeeze in short workouts on other days. Honestly, without sports I’d probably go crazy.\n\nAnother factor is that I still live at home. My family expects me to spend a lot of time with them, helping out aroud the hosue, hanging with my sibling, etc. I feel guilty if I ignore them, so usually when I get back from uni I end up just chilling in the living room instead of working on a personal project. On top of that, my little brother has been sick for a few years and can’t really leave the house, so he needs more of my time and energy too. I hope he gets better soon, since that would have a good impact on both our lives.\n\nI’m the type of person who really likes having structure and a routine, so part of me feels like moving out nearby could help me manage my time better. But then that also makes me feel guilty for “leaving” my family.\n\nMeanwhile, one of my classmates (and a good friend) has the same ambitions as me, but his routine is very different. After studying all day, he takes break at home, then spends the rest of the evening grinding on a personal project until he goes to bed. He basically lives on his own, doesn’t care much for sports, and spends almost all his time in front of a screen. I can see it working for him, he’s making progress and hitting his goals,  but I also suspect it’s taking a toll on his health. Still, I can’t help but compare myself to him and admire his discipline.\n\nSorry for the info dump, but I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone has advice on how to balance studies, family, health, and personal projects, I’d really appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if people got drop some project ideas or just routes i can take. I only looked into automating stuff in my live. But maybe there are far more intersting usefull and lucrative ideas (altho i doubt people would tell this one if they know it :))",

It’s honestly embarrassing to admit, but after a three-year course, all I really know is just the basics of web development — HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, bit of nodejs and mongodb . Writing this makes me feel ashamed because I don’t know what I did with all this time.\n\nNow I’ve got around 8 months left before graduation. For my project idea, I was planning to build a simple web app a platform to connect local organizations, community groups, and citizens, where people could find local events, volunteering opportunities, or community updates in one place. My thought was that at least I could learn something while trying to finish this project.\n\nBut when I presented it, my teacher wasn’t impressed and honestly, I don’t blame him. Looking back, I can see the idea probably didn’t sound very impressive the way I explained it. He said:\n\nI should add AI integration. And more importantly, he told me: *“Web development is dead. You should switch to mobile development. It would be better for you. Everybody knows web dev\"*\n\nNow I’m stuck. I know I wasted so much time, but I want to at least use these last months to learn and build something. My main question is: is web development really “dead” and not worth doing anymore? Or is it still okay to stick with web dev for my project, since that’s all I know right now?",

Kinda looking to see what’s out there to get away from the on-call lifestyle and EU support.\n\nI’ve started to take an interest in Databases/Data Analytics (really anything working with data), particularly MySQL to start. I took some simple database courses years back in college and thought they were fun, and from just browsing, the work hours seem pretty concrete and work/life balance is pretty nice (from what I read).\n\nI would say i’m about ~15 - 20 hours in following a Udemy course that i’m nearing finishing. I just started doing some online “practice” like AnalystBuilder and I can confidently say I feel like maybe 1/2 of what I learned through udemy courses stuck lol. I’m not discouraged, but I am curious what to expect if I keep going down the rabbit hole.\n\nFirst off, i’m curious to what actual Data Engineers/Analysts think about starting to learn SQL now that AI had changed the game imo. I could imagine if AI scales like it has been in the last few years, in less than 10 years part of data analysis will be fully automated (like everything else probably). Whats the panic level in the industry if any? I know some engineering jobs are more resilient.\n\nMore relevant to me and my learning process:\n\nHow long would you say it takes to really grasp and understanding of syntax? To me it all seems very overwhelming, I have a feeling a lot of you will say you’ve been working with it for a decade and still reference the docs every day for simple stuff lol, but I mean for it to “click” when reading a question, instead of having to revisit material to jog your memory.\n\nWhat was the best way you learned? Videos? Real world problems (websites for practice), actual real world data? I’m open to suggestions, but i don’t want to waste my time with doing things like AnalystBuilder if there are better ways to get a real glimpse into the day in the life if that makes sense and will prepare me for an actual job.\n\nI am a college grad in Computer science (CIS), so i’m willing to bet just like all other CS jobs, its a brutal job market, are certs absolutely needed? Or should i focus on building projects? Wondering what sets people apart from the hiring process according to those in the industry.\n\nIf theres anything else i’m neglecting to see with all of this, feel free to give advice or words of motivation as well!",

I couldn't do much from scratch.\n\nSo my question is: How do I get better and \"impress\" my colleagues?

It felt like the right choice since it’s practical, has lots of learning resources, and can give me a good foundation before I move on to advanced topics.\n\nNow I’m a bit over halfway through, but I’ve started to lose some motivation. I notice that with AI  can do many tasks if you know and understand how things work . Besides AI can do many other task easily outside of programming.As I think ahead 5–6 years, I wonder how much more advanced AI will become, and it makes me question whether my efforts are meaningful, and is it right career path\n\nOn top of that, I work full-time. After work I’m usually tired, but I push myself to learn because I enjoy coding and want to do something on my own way which keeps me motivated. Recently  though, I’ve been feeling burnt out and a little depressed, because I fear that after investing all this time, If I can not do something, I will feel lost. As I had decided to pursue this path as a long term career, so this doubt is weighing heavily on me.\n\nI’m not learning this for a job and job is optional  (I know the market is saturated ).\n\n• What should I do? \n\n• Should I consider  changing career path or should I stick with it ?\n\nPlease help me to figure it out because I could not make any decision.\n\nI would really appreciate your honest opinions and advice.\n\nP.S.

I have around 2 years of professional experience (plus personal projects), and my degree is in Industrial Engineering, not CS, unfortunately.\n\nI’m currently exploring job opportunities in the EU and I live in Turkey as a EU citizen. From what I’ve seen, Go related roles are quite limited and often target senior/lead engineers (likely for teams migrating to Go). Because of this, I’m considering shifting to Java for backend work, since it seems to have a much broader job market.\n\nAt the same time, I’m also tempted by C++. There aren’t many developers specializing in low-level coding, and I feel that makes it a valuable skill in the long run. On top of that, I really enjoy thinking about systems, hardware, and OS-level concepts (not recommend assembly :) ), though I have very limited knowledge since I don’t come from a CS background. This makes me wonder if transitioning to C++ would be worth compared to Java.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences, whether it’s about job market trends, learning paths, or the trade-offs between going deeper into Go, switching to Java, or investing in C++.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have thought up of a way on how to code already, but I don't know if it's the most efficient or if it's even a good thing(?) I'm basically using ChatGPT as my instructor/tutor. I'm in 2nd year college right now as a BSIT software dev specialty, and I kind of messed up during the first year because I couldn't learn much since I got carried by my group for the rest of the year and I didn't really learn how to code. We're using java at the time and so I'm learning java right now because that's our syllabus.\n\nI'm now trying to learn how to code by myself and I'm trying to catch up hopefully in a couple of months ( Only have 2 months left before the 2nd semester in which we'll have to code again) I asked ChatGPT to teach me coding starting from the beginning all the way to whatever, I don't know what I don't know yet so I just asked him to give me a syllabus that we'll be following.\n\nAm I doing well or is what I'm doing counterproductive? Any advice is appreciated; I figured out that it's better to ask for professionals/people with experience regarding this type of stuff rather than soloing it all the way.",

        "content": "Firstly, I'm tired of endlessly reading books/tutorials on languages. I switched three resources for C++. The last one was the most recommended - C++ primer, 5th edition (or whatever edition covers C++11). After authors told me about auto and decltype() in SECOND chapter, I dropped it, because... No. Just no. Why would they teach me this, if they even couldn't provide me some real-world examples of its usage? The worst thing is that I know C++'s basics, so reading any book on C++ becomes mostly a torment for me. And yet I can't just \"skip to the interesting part\", because I never know what I'm gonna miss unless I read that. :) And the most important: I'm just tired of doing nothing. Yeah, there are these little exercises in each chapter, but I wanna learn programming to make software, not to accomplish those exercises. That means, I would like to start building something as soon as possible.\n\nI have some experience in C, C++, C#, Python. The last language I used was python. Python did let me start building as soon as possible (thanks to python's docs and previous experience in C-languages). I mostly liked it, but I'm pretty sure that I don't wanna tie my life to it. I tried building a text-only roguelike with it, but I struggled with the structure. Not that I'm saying this is python's fault, just sharing what I made so far with it. I made the main game loop (fight system, basically) and classes of characters (warrior, mage, etc). Each character has max health, max mana, level, some spells and growths of health and mana with each level (like growths of attributes in DoTA 2). Stopped and decided to rewrite the whole thing, because it felt like the structure got too messy. The largest barrier in making it is import cycles existence and relations between classes.  \n\nAlso I had to work on C# for two weeks. I made a GUI calculator with it, which uses the worst but (it seems) working algorithm of evaluation. C# let me start building right away too, thanks to my previous C++ knowledge. I also found Microsoft docs really helpful. \n\nI have ~~experience~~ knowledge of old C++, which is compatible with C (raw pointers, C-strings, C-arrays, etc), and knowledge of just a few things that comes only with C++, like vectors/stacks/queues and classes (basics of all of them).\n\nFinally, I would like to provide my vision on languages that I'm interested in OR have ever tried. Note that I don't consider web at all (and even electron or whatever way to use JS for software developing). I'm not interested in it.\n\nC++: seems too low-level to just let me start building things, plus it has terrible ecosystem with all of these build systems, their generators (CMake, Meson) and unpleasant ways to get 3rd party libraries.\n\nRust: seems too low-level to just let me start building things. It does have better ecosystem, but I guess there are just no resources on it for newbies like me.\n\nC#: tied to windows... Not that I hate it, but coding on windows just feels wrong, plus I've never found something better than bare GNU Emacs when it comes to text editors, but it works fine only on native linux setup. There is .NET SDK for Linux, but... I'm not sure. I sort of can't believe that it's actually good and is being used in production, knowing what Linux to Microsoft is.\n\nJava: ...Not sure when it comes to future... I heard that there are no new projects on Java...\n\nPython: I don't see myself using it, knowing where it's being used mostly (I would like to make standalone software). Also, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be much harder to find a job because of how popular Python is.\n\nI ask you to give your views on what I should and shouldn't do and your views on the languages I listed above. Thank you!",

Although it is very interesting the sir that teaches us this subject told us it is not much use in coding and getting a internship and most of my class didn't understand what's going on this subject and they didn't seem to care about it so I have to put extra hours just to understand what the meaning of syntex and what  half-adder,Full-adders, ALU are  and some time goes to resolve the errors and hit and trial with language . So my question is should I learn assembly language and other computer thing to a good extent or just study it to pass my exams. ",

I'm a little more familiar with Python since I specialize in AI and had some focus on data science courses. I'm ok with Data Science technologies like R and Python but I'm not really as interested in analysing data as I am with AI. So I know where I want to go from here. I've found some things I need to focus on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but let me be honest I really am overwhelmed and lost where to go from here. There's just too many resources, frameworks, technologies and I don't know how to start from scratch.\n\nI feel like I wasted my past few years in Uni even though my GPA is decent because I usually forgot most things I learned after the course is over and never really applied it to projects. To add on, I'm just learning how to upload projects on github. I like solving problems and experimenting with AI especially back in one module I learnt on Computer Visions and Natural Language so I know I'm interested in that. So before I graduate, I really want to focus on building up skills and making projects.\n\nBut here's the problem I hate reading theory and going back over basic foundations because I already understand the basics and it's boring to do pointless tutorials on websites like FreeCodeCamp or the likes. I'm currently just starting with smaller projects like [practisepython.org](http://practisepython.org) and learning CLI projects on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but even those are not going to help me learn AI models and technologies. I'm aware I can't just jump to that without practising coding on smaller projects like what I'm doing but I would also prefer to  learn while doing some challenging projects that are not too hard but at the same time forces me to learn new things along the way. For example, I just started trying to build a chatbot using langchain documentation but even setting up the dependencies are a pain in the ass.\n\nI really want to learn and develop my AI skills before I graduate  in a very time-efficient manner so I would appreciate on any advice, tips, resources that are not theory heavy/focused or boring tutorials.

I'm on a tighter time budget as this is something i can only do outside of work, so \\~8 hours tops per week. Do you have some advice how to improve with such time constraint?

The main thing I'm worried about is getting hit with those obscure \"random trivia\" questions (the kind of ones you see on LinkedIn that always seem to be trick questions) during an interview.\n\n* I am most familiar with Python (using it for 3 years), but I haven't been that successful with projects for it. A lot of the time I burn out on projects and they go unfinished. Still, I think I have a relatively deep understanding of the language, features, and ecosystem.\n\n* Over the past year and a half I've been using TypeScript and React for projects. I think it's been way more successful than the Python so far. I followed a course for it and I have some projects I'm really proud of. React is very complicated, though, and it seems I'm expected to know more about how it works under the hood (virtual DOM, rendering, lifecycle, performance, etc.).\n\nBased on what I said about both these things, can I even put either of them on my resume? Do I need to have more languages than this? Any advice?",

It has been wonderful and I enjoy learning about it but the problem is that I feel so lost and stupid. I have tried my hardest to understand how things works. I took the quiz and got F on it which made me feel unfit for Computer Science major. I am aware of commitment and determination but I also feel stressed whenever I try to code for myself or solve the problems (Most of my assignments are typically due in three days. My professor assign us lab for us to work on our own on Thursdays.). I am afraid of failing Computer science and the professor. To make things a bit more difficult, I can't seem to retain the information that the professor had lectured and I don't want to look away from my interpreter to just miss some information. (I have hearing loss, or in simple words, I'm deaf that have access to the sound. My community college has provided accommodations.).\n\nI don't know which flair to use but I could really use some advices. I am really terrified to fail CS and I have been interested in programming for a while but did not know where to start until the first day of CS in community college.\n\nI also have been thinking of science major (I have a strong interest in science same as computer science, but I don't want to switch the major just yet.) since it seems to be a lot easier for me due to taking a lot of chemistry classes in HS. It does sound like I am lazy.\n\nSorry for the vent or rant. This has something been on my mind and I have been talking to my friend and family but I feel like this subreddit may help me to see things differently and understand differently.\n\n  \nThank you for taking the time to read the post. :)\n\n(If this post violates to any of rules, please let me know and I will gladly to delete the post and take it to other appropriate subreddit to post on!)",

        "author": "MrGiggleFiggle",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "One of the hardest parts of learning for me is understanding how to set up my folder structure and the options in the package.json and tsconfig files. I solve one error and another pops up.\n\nTools: vanilla typescript, vite, tailwind, node express, ejs\n\nBased on my understanding, I have to `tsc` client and server since the browser and node can only read js.\n\n**Package.json**\n\n      \"scripts\": {\n        // for development\n        \"watch:ts\": \"tsc -w\", // tsc server files and output into server/dist\n        \"dev:server\": \"nodemon server/dist/app.js\", // start server and listen on port 3000\n        \"dev:client\": \"vite\", // takes care of client, compiles ts and tailwind.\n        \"dev\": \"concurrently \\\"watch:ts\\\" \\\"npm run dev:server\\\" \\\"npm run dev:client\\\"\",\n    \n        // for production\n        \"build:ts\": \"tsc\",\n        \"build:client\": \"vite build\",\n        \"build\": \"npm run build:ts && npm run build:client\",\n        \"preview\": \"vite preview\"\n      },\n\nI had a hard time outputting a dist folder when I ran `watch:ts`  because I had `\"noEmit\": true` and `\"emitDeclarationOnly\": true` in my tsconfig.json file.\n\nAfter I solved this (using chatGPT), when I run dev:client, I get `Named export 'SupabaseClient' not found. The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.` But my package.json has `\"type\": \"module\"`, and tsconfig has `\"module\": \"ESNext\",` so why am I getting a commonJS error? I feel like I have to understand a history of js. I know I probably have to look through the typescript docs or package.json docs but I don't know what to look for in the first place when I run into these errors.\n\nI don't really understand the difference between dev and build either. In dev, when I change my code and save, it automatically updates with new js files? But isn't that just the same for build when I have to prepare for deployment?\n\n***Where can I read up on how the whole ecosystem works so I'm not running into one problem after another? I think that the js environment changes so frequently that youtube videos become outdated. I also don't want to rely on youtube videos because they don't usually explain why. And if I'm not using the exact technologies/frameworks they're using, then I'm not really understanding.***\n\n***If I were to use cooking as an analogy, I don't want to follow a recipe but rather understand the chemistry behind certain types of food combinations.***\n\n**Folder structure:**\n\n    my-project/\n    ├─ package.json\n    ├─ tsconfig.json\n    ├─ vite.config.ts\n    ├─ server/\n    │  ├─ dist/\n    │  ├─ index.ts\n    │  ├─ views/\n    │  ├─ routes/\n    │  ├─ controllers/\n    │  └─ database/\n    ├─ client/\n    │  ├─ index.html\n    │  ├─ src/\n    │  │   ├─ main.ts\n    │  │   ├─ DOMfunctions.ts\n    │  │   └─ supabaseClient.ts",

The HIRE Act 2025 proposes a 25% tax on offshore spending, which would generate about $40 billion annually. That figure comes just from U.S. spending in India, before even considering other countries. Instead of disappearing overseas, that money would be reinvested here at home, funding apprenticeships, reskilling programs, and workforce training. In practice, that means more Americans getting the chance to learn in-demand tech skills, land better jobs, and actually compete for the roles that are currently being offshored.\n\nWith the new $100K H-1B fees, companies will likely push even more jobs offshore. That’s why the HIRE Act matters, it’s the only effort on the table to regulate offshoring and redirect that money into building up our own workforce.\n\nMoney-hungry U.S. companies keep chasing lower costs overseas instead of putting resources into developing Americans and strengthening the US economy.\n\n[HIRE Act 2025 (PDF)](https://www.moreno.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-HIRE-Act.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

        "content": "When I was younger, my family moved constantly. I was always the “new kid” and extremely introverted. People decided who I was before I had a chance to show them. Later on in life at internships and then at work I still carried that same feeling of “im just not good with people.”\n\nHere’s what nobody told me: social skills are NOT fixed.\n\nEven if it feels awkward at first, you can train them the same way youd train a muscle or learn a language. Back then, I literally took notes on how the “social naturals” in class or at work interacted - how they spoke up in meetings, how they introduced themselves at networking events - and I practiced those behaviors until they felt natural.\n\nIf you’re worried that being quiet or introverted means youll struggle in interviews, networking, or team projects: it’s not a life sentence. You can change it with practice, and the improvement compounds just like technical skills.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has deliberately “trained” their social skills for career situations? What worked for you?\n\n**EDIT:** wow didn’t expect this to resonate so much 😭. someone in the comments said “no one ever has actionable advice” so I wanted to share what i have considered as my secret trick for maintaining my social skills which is this app called Gleam, it gives u daily guided practice and its been the easiest way for me to continuously practice towards improved social skill and confidence :)",

        "content": "After my last layoff from a full time job, I decided for the first time to actually stop ignoring the recruiters messaging me about W2 contract roles and actually see what it's about. I ended up getting a role through one of the major firms in tech. I'm now 2 years in after a few renewals, and oh my god, I didn't know what I was missing.\n\nIt's probably just because of the type of person I am. I hate \"team building\" bullshit and people who treat work like a social club. I want to be left alone so I can do my work, though I'm good at working as part of a team and collaborating when needed. But work is work to me, I don't want to be friends and get together for a beer.\n\nI don't have to go a bunch of the company meetings and townhalls. I don't have to meet with a manager each quarter to discuss my \"career goals\" because nobody cares. I just get my work, do it, and get my weekly paycheck that is significantly higher than my full time pay was, even accounting for paying for the insurance I get through the firm. Nobody cares when I clock in and out, as long as I get my work done. There's no less job security than there was at my full time roles where rounds of layoffs would come every year at least.\n\nThis is the only job I've ever had where I am not constantly bombarded with a bunch of \"extracurricular\" bullshit that eats away at my soul and burns me out.\n\nOh yeah, perhaps most importantly: **I got the job after two interviews: a phone screen with HR and a technical discussion with my team, with no leetcode or DSA interrogation rounds.** Just a discussion of my projects and experience. \n\nI have friends who have been doing this for years and they have similar experiences to me. I feel dumb for not having tried it sooner, because I bought into the idea that it was \"lesser\" or was afraid I wouldn't have good enough health insurance.\n\nAnyway, YMMV, but just wanted to provide a counterbalance to the people who run down contract work. From what I have found it can be a very viable option.",

I had been at my current position for almost 2 years (started as a contractor in November 2023, then was hired directly in November 2024). Today I was suddenly laid off, and although I've been laid off before, this took me by surprise. There was no warning, and from what I'd heard, it sounded like my team was actually doing pretty well - My team was contributing to things that were being delivered and sold; also, just last week, our manager had said people like what my team was able to get done, and people were actually considering sending another project to our team. I went in to work this morning as usual, and then my manager took me aside into a conference room and let me know I was being laid off.  He said it's just due to the economic situation and has nothing to do with my performance. And I had to turn in my stuff and leave immediately. My manager said if there are more openings (maybe in January), he'd hire me back.\n\nAs I had been there only a short time, I was still learning things about the company's software & products, but I was getting things done.  I'd heard things about the industry as a whole, but it sounded like we were doing well, so this feels like it came out of nowhere, as I was not given any advance notice.  My wife and I have been planning a vacation (finally) too; we bought tickets & everything to leave not even 2 weeks from now.\n\nI'm getting a bit frustrated with the industry's trend of repeated layoffs. And naturally, companies end up seeing a need to hire more people again eventually..  I like software development, but sometimes I wonder if I should have chosen a different industry.",

        "content": "6 years ago (I was 34), I went switched careers by taking a coding bootcamp. Prior to the bootcamp I had no coding experience. I did a few short-term contracts before getting my current role, where I've been for 5 years.\n\nI work for a small company with 12 developers. 9 of the developers are senior developers, and I am not included in that. I get tickets out the door and complete tasks. I think I generally do a good job, but I feel like my coding skills are still weak. At my job there is no real mentoring, company structure, training, or development. I feel mediocre because I can't contribute at the same level as a senior dev and I've been doing this for 5 years. I also feel like the actual coding part does not play to my natural skillset (I never coded as a kid, I didn't do well at math) and so I find I'm not picking up naturally (things light architecture and system design). \n\nThis week my company said that everyone must be on track to be a senior developer, and must become a senior developer in an allotted amount of time (specifics of this haven't been provided yet). \n\nI know you might suggest that I do a bunch of side projects and weekend work, but I've got young kids and honestly no time for learning outside of work. I like my job, it pays the bills, but when I compare myself to the seniors I work with, I know I will never be as good of a developer.",

        "content": "After 6 months of navigating this shitty job market I got a fully remote job at a midsized biotech for 130k base salary with no bonus or other comp. I’ve been working here for about a month and a half and its been pretty great; the work-life-balance is nice and the culture so far is chill. My team is developing a brand new product for the company which is pretty exciting, but that also means there’s risks.\nThe product could flop, maybe the culture shifts once its released and we are supporting client, or maybe the product gets cancelled, i get laid-off, and my resume shows me working on some zero impact project. The work is pure Java with some Vertx.\n\nA recruiter reached out to me about a role i was previously rejected on. Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:\n130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)\nThe catch is it’s 4x a week in office and currently a 30-45 minute commute to the most touristy part of the city. The company had a recent round of layoffs as well so im not sure if it’s really the much more stable apart from the product being more mature.\n\nObviously, i’d feel bad leaving a company within a few months especially one that i really like, but is it dumb to pass up such a pay raise?\n\nAny advice or additional considerations is welcome.",

I’ve never caused carry over or an immediate defect since joining the team so I had no problem, and I send every question I ask since my tech lead keeps telling him I’m not technically independent.\n\nAfter two sprints, my manager was like “yeah I don’t have anything to say about this, I’ll look into what you can do to get to exceeding expectations. Make sure you’re more vocal about your accomplishments from here on out.”\n\nSo just like that, I went from being underperforming and on the verge of being let go for 7 months straight to doing fine. I guess my tech lead was overwhelming him with so much negative feedback that he thought “man, this guy must be having people straight up coding for him every sprint.” Absolutely not. My work is my own work. I never caused carry over. I do not have people code for me. I ask for help by saying what I tried first. \n\nBut this whole experience has really made me feel stressed and unstable in this position. I’m doing the work load of a senior developer with one year of experience currently, and my tech lead wants me to do that while approving pr’s (no problem) while fixing random problems with the application( problem) , while volunteering for extra work (beyond what I can do). And if I say a “bad question” this guy goes straight to my manager. What is a bad question? Whatever pisses him off after his boss gets done yelling at him apparently. \n\nEdit: oh yea, and I do technically have autofilled, easy placeholder goals. New manager didn’t know and i didn’t know, but I have performance goals like “say how you upheld company values”\n\nAnd what I get another manager? What if he isn’t a good one and just believes whatever my tech lead says? What if, while doing my senior developer workload, I end up carrying over ONE user story(now my tech lead actually has an excuse to get me fired, my manager will be the first person he messages.) \n\nAnd yes, I am going to apply for more jobs, but I’m also not vested(employer contributions to my 401k aren’t settled) until I hit the two year mark. That’s a little bit away. But this has all left me with so many questions.\n\nIs this normal? \n\nWhat just happened? \n\nShould I go all in on applying for other jobs? \n\nShould I wait to vest? \n\nDo you think I’ll get fired before I vest? \n\nIs software engineering stable long term because this feels pretty unstable for me and I want to get married and have a stable income. \n\n",

Nobody really cares whether you are working from the office or from home.\n\nBecause I felt I had started a little late, I set clear goals for myself and committed to following them with full focus. The company provides resources for learning, so I used every single one of them. On top of that I bought my own courses, set up AWS accounts, and practiced daily. I even had an old server lying around at home. I spun it up with Ubuntu and started building a homelab on weekends.\n\nExcited about my progress, I shared everything with my boss, hoping for feedback and guidance. Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as “too ambitious” and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.\n\nAt first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.\n\nMy plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.\n\nWhat I have realized is that ambition makes some people uncomfortable, but it also attracts the right kind of people who genuinely want to see you succeed. I am grateful that I found one of those people here.\n\nEdit: I have been axed. Received email. I had just put my son to school in August. :)",

For the third or fourth time in a row I've done 3, 4, 5, or 6 rounds with different companies (mostly smaller-medium sized), as far as I know passed the technicals (or at least gotten 85-90%) and still gotten rejected in the final round. The one piece of feedback I got was that they were looking for an engineer who was \"more product focused\" (wtf does that mean). It feels like a completely different world interviewing now compared to when I last did it (2020). The crazy number of rounds and never ending technicals that even if you pass, don't really seem to mean anything anymore. Have never felt this lost in a job market before, not even as a fresh graduate.",

        "content": "So I'm a CS and data sci double major at an average state school with an average CS dept, in my senior year. I have some internship experience, but from joke roles where I barely do anything (and barely get paid anything). The people there (and my friends) say I do good, but I don't think so. My resume has been reviewed and I'm told it looks excellent, but I feel like I blow up a lot of it and that the whole thing is this shitty cardboard Potemkin village set that'll just collapse with one nudge. Some of my resume stuff is literally just stupid ChatGPT stuff. I feel like I'm likely to fail any technical interview or OA I'm given, and while I'm actively trying to correct this, I think it's genuinely too little too late. I can barely remember a lot of the stuff I've learned a few years ago (including pre-GPT). I believe if I were where I currently am but 1 year ago, I'd actually be really cracked and have better success with internships, but now it's too late to apply to most of those.\n\nI'm realistic about my goals and don't expect to ever break into FAANG or anything of that tier in my lifetime. I knew I wasn't FAANG material since high school. But all I want is to be able to live on my own away from my shitty Asian parents. I've applied to tech roles at non-tech companies, SWE-adjacent roles rather than pure SWE, etc. On average I'm speaking with one real human per month, but as I move into full-time recruitment rather than intern recruitment, I notice signs of this slowing.\n\nI feel average no matter what I do. And in this job market, you cannot be average. I feel gravely ashamed of myself for being so average when I was smart in elementary school. (Long story but I got kicked out of middle school, which could explain my inability to succeed or be \"at the top of the pack\"). In many ways I honestly regret even majoring in CS, but I concede many other fields, e.g. the hard sciences, might've been even worse choices for me, and had I chosen those I wouldn't likely even have semi-stellar grades to brag about. And since I'm so far ahead in the game, it's literally too late to even do so. Plus my parents refuse to pay beyond 4 years of tuition and think delaying graduation is stupid (and to be honest they're probably right). When I suggested pivoting to nursing or the trades, they just laughed in my face over how poorly I'd do in those jobs (and again, they're right, I genuinely am physically weak and would struggle in those roles).\n\nIf things don't get better by next summer after I graduate, I honestly wonder if I should just spend all of my money on bus tickets to some random city in the Midwest and live on the street there. Maybe blow the rest on lottery tickets since at this point there's almost no difference. Sure beats having to shuttle to and from my crummy parents' house. I sometimes wish I could turn back time and obey my parents more so I wouldn't be in this situation, but then I realize even that wouldn't have helped.\n\nI know that ideally, this year I should be going crazy with everything, but at this point I'm saddled with so many course and other responsibilities (including some dismaying parental conflicts) that I think there's a genuine possibility that my grades could even plummet below 3.6 GPA. Also, my parents are also begging me to consider a Master's, but I really don't even know if I should do so - what if even with a Master's I fail?\n\nFor further context I'm Chinese American, have an autism dx, and grew up under a Protestant Christian background. So what should I do, and how hopeless do I seem?",

It's been sometime since I used this.  I would say I know this language 5/10\n\nPHP: I used this for a couple of years as old job had a monolith, I actually didn't mind this language and was really easy to pick up, no concurrency or like just a straight crud app with a LAMP stack.

I would say I know this language 5 maybe 6/10\n\nJavaScript: Used it for a couple of years from what i remember it was promise chain hell, have done some stuff with it recently on a full stack node.js app but it has so much crap on top I am not a fan, I tend to almost write Java like code in Javascript. I would say I know this language 3/10\n\n  \nI really want to get a deeper knowledge of one of these languages and make it my main one, I feel almost a tie between C/Python/Golang.   \n  \nC for just sheer simplicity I'm sure it will be segfaults out the ass in the beginning but would be fun to get that low level and just be me talking to the computer's memory, then again it may break me. Could open opportunities for hardware or os programming.\n\nPython I feel fast and free with this language, just having to remember at times when func params are copied etc. Fast to work with but many others have called it slow, also nice that it's the default language of AI so very versatile.  \n  \nGolang easier use of pointers and mem management, simplified concurrency programming, I haven't done much beyond crud so hard to know just how efficient this language could be if I go a little deeper. Also seems that lots of jobs openings.\n\nSorry if this post is a little rambley I'm just out of work and wanting to enjoy programming again for fun, so just thinking aloud. If you made it this far thank you would love to hear your opinions/takes and even fun projects within each language?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nI have a complex situation, I'm from California but I've mostly been living in the UK for the past few years (with sponsorship). I've been offered a role at a startup that wants me to be UK-based but they don't have their sponsorship license and aren't rushing to get it. They think the process will take 2-3 months.\n\nSo, they want me to start as a US-based contractor. Problem is, they're only offering me $8,333/month. That barely covers my costs, let alone they expect me to pay for the visa (almost $7k) and they expect me to pay my own travel back and forth for their monthly in-person in London (they said they'd pay my flights in the interview).\n\nI pushed back and they offered $10k/mo, but this is still so low. I had been excited to work there, the UK salary they're offering is decent, but this is just demoralizing. I'll basically have to dip into my savings to work for them, they don't seem to understand the costs that a contractor incurs. The CEO gave some chat about bootstrapping it with limited cashflow, but it's a spinoff from an existing company that's been around for 70 years, so unless he has mismanaged that company they should be able to offer decent comp.\n\nAlso, they were aware from when I started interviewing in July that I would not be based fulltime in London due to my caring responsibilities in California. I don't even have a flat in London at the minute. They said they'd cover flights and I'd cover accommodation. The market is bad so okay. But I have my mom's dog to care for in California and I live an 8 hour drive from a big airport, so I need parking or an uber from a relative's house or something -- essentially getting to/from airports will cost as much as an economy flight. The UK salary offered is 80k, which will seem low here but trust me, it's not bad. I don't have a ton of experience.\n\nThat's the other weird thing, I don't have a ton of experience, but they think I'll be fine in essentially a CTO role for this startup. I'm the sole SWE. So on the one hand 80k GBP is not horrible in the UK for my experience level; on the other hand given the amount of responsibility it is low.\n\nBut anyways, the main issue is what to do about the lowball contractor rate for California. I can't afford to live on that and fly to London and pay the visa. They could get the visa sponsorship in 10 days, but they're not willing to rush, so I'm essentially eating that cost while they dilly dally.\n\nBut the market is so crap and I don't have much experience so I feel I have to take it. Any advice would be super welcome. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’ve been working for 10 years as a software engineer and I feel stuck. \n\nI have a degree in architecture (but never worked as an architect) and I did 3d art professionally for almost 15 years prior to making the switch.\n\nI was basically aiming to become a technical artist by adding some coding skills, but overshot it, first becoming a “creative technologist” and then landing a software engineering role. \nSince then, I worked exclusively for startups, most of which folded. By the time I realized I should have been applying for big companies, the layoffs started happening. \n\nMost of my roles revolved around WebGL which feels like a really weird niche. I don’t really consider myself a graphics engineer, but I do work a lot with shaders, GPGPU stuff, can read some whitepapers and such. I have some vague understanding of how GPUs work, but not enough to understand cache coherence, never worked with geometry shaders etc. WebGL felt like a path of least resistance - there’s no need to understand compute shaders when they don’t exist. Also, what these “cloud viewers” need, usually isn’t that advanced, one can get a lot of mileage by just knowing how to write shaders and understanding what draw calls are. \n\nSo instead of growing in that direction and trying to become a bonafide graphics engineer, I thought that it would be easier and better to become a front end engineer that has some graphics chops.\n\nI’m not entirely sure if I succeed at this. I’ve had a job where I was mentoring people on react and typescript in addition to doing graphics, was making architecture decisions and such. I’ve had one where I made a Final Cut Pro clone with react. But ive also had some where I’d get laid off once the graphics need was gone, and there were other dedicated FE engineers. \n\nI think because 3D meshes may feel alien to a backend/full stack engineer, i ended up doing some computational geometry as well. But again like WebGL, what I did felt amateurish - it did the job, but was typescript, not c++ or rust. Sometimes it would run in the browser, sometimes in node, but far from using something like open cascade. As in, I wasn’t able to combine mature systems in a serious language. But I was able to implement my own half edges, quadtree and such, surgically, to solve a problem. \n\nI’d grind leetcode and do well in interviews, which is how I landed my best jobs, but this seems like it’s over now. I did poorly at an AI interview earlier this year. \n\nObviously this is all IC type of stuff, which I do like, but I’ve been exposed to different management styles. Some times it was a free for all, no code reviews, anyone can nuke the master branch, no standup, no retro, just me and my CEO sitting side by side, while our CTO is missing in action. Other times it was really anal agile for the sake of being agile. My favorite situation was when a place that lacked structure got a very good technical program manager. She introduced processes gradually, each time outlining what we were struggling with and then offering a solution. This got me interested in management in general, but I wasn’t able to really pick up much. I worked with some engineers who transitioned to managers, and they were just way more on top of these things. Worked with some that remained ICs but were still super organized. \n\n\n\nI am lucky to be employed atm and I actually really like my job. If all goes well I may just get unstuck on my own. But having been through the grinder, and since this is another startup, I may be back to where I started. \n\n\nSo, what can I do to be employable in the next ten years, even better, to thrive?\n\n\nIf I were to leverage my architectural background, how could I do that? By far the two shittiest jobs that I had were in two construction tech startups. I’m still not sure what happened there, I thought I’d bring some domain knowledge to the table, in addition to useful coding skills, it didn’t happen. \n\nIs there anything that the 3d art is good for? I feel like the ship for this has sailed 10 years ago. I had a massive imposter syndrome after my first creative technologist job. I did not reach out to my bosses friend who worked at META, and instead bent over backwards to land a job as a FE engineer. I recently saw a talk by this lady who was a UX designer there, where she says how she has no idea how she got hired there in the first place as a graphics designer. 10 years ago I met a person at a hackathon in SF, same profile - a 3d artist looking to break into tech. I don’t think they ever became a software engineer, but maybe even better - a VR evangelist for Mozilla.\n\nHow could I utilize this if at all? Go “by the way, I have an eye for color and composition”? “I can speak the same language as both your 3d artists and your engineers”? Who am I even trying to convince here, a 20yo CEO probably doesn’t care about some 3d renderings from 20 years ago no matter how good they were for the time?\n\nMaybe just pick up figma and say “look I do UX/UI too”?\n\n\nIf I were to put all my money on the IC path, what should I focus on? More graphics? More web (full stack)? Try to become an expert on rust?\n\n\nWhat about going back to school, what field would even make sense?\n\n\nSorry about the stream of consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Lots of little details here so bear with me. \n\n\nTech lead, 13 YOE, F500, WFH 95% of the time. Only need to go into the office for select VIP meetings. \n\n\nI am 9 weeks into \"maternity leave\" (aka 6 weeks to heal from major abdominal surgery plus 6 weeks unpaid leave) and I am getting anxiety about the end of it looming - mostly about dropping off my baby into daycare. First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.\n\n\nThis part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).\n\n\nI have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.\n\n\nAn additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a \"solution architect\" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal. \n\n\nSo I guess my questions are... Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? Am I crazy for contemplating how I can make it work? Any suggestions or advice in general? ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello, \n\nI realize I might get clowned for asking this, but I do genuinely think hearing peoples' perspectives will help me.\n\nI have been working as a Software Engineer at a relatively large (for a startup) startup for 3 years now (was 22 then, am 25 now). I work on pretty low-levelled stuff with C, like Linux kernel stuff, network stuff, etc. I started as an intern right out of college making $25 an hour, but gradually moved up each year to $140,000 per year which I make now.\n\nMy team is really chill overall, and I am good friends with a good-sized portion of the team members. I do think that I have learned a lot already throughout my \\~3 years at my current role, but I know I could still learn more here if I stayed. But it would have to come from myself searching out new opportunities actively within the organization, as the work I have been getting has been kind of the same for a while, and I do feel kind of monotonous at times. However, I also fault myself for not being more proactive and asking my boss for more interesting work, I realize I've been kind of just doing whatever they needed me to do, without advocating to be given what I think would be most interesting/ best for my learning. Lastly I should mention that I do lots of work with an overseas team so sometimes I have to do late night meetings and stuff which is not exactly preferable (though I'm sure that's not necessarily something that is avoidable, and might happen at any other job).\n\nThe situation I am in is, I have just received an offer from AWS as an SDE II, at around \\~$330,000 total compensation. I wasn't really seeking it out, I just got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, and thought I'd give it a shot and see how the interview process went. And then, yeah I just kind of Forrest Gump'd to an offer. So yeah it all kind of happened sort of fast for me, so I have mixed emotions. Obviously, the money is more (though the startup I work at might get acquired, I think we do have potential offers etc., but I am not entirely sure as the management hasn't directly told us). But I am trying to decide what is best for my career. While I love my current team, I do think that I could gain a lot from expanding my horizons. And working at Amazon might also allow me to open new doors. The team I was offered to join is pretty similar to what I am doing now (systems level and network stuff). But I also would potentially have more opportunities to move around within the organization (eventually) and try new things, which is definitely not really possible with my current company. Also I think I might want to try living somewhere else some day (been in the Bay Area really my whole life) and obviously it might be easier to do that if I had other offices at my company I could go to (not really an option at my current company).\n\n  \nSo I guess I just want to hear what people would do in my shoes, it is surprisingly a little difficult to decide. I do think I know what most of you are going to say but I just thought it would be good to seek the guidance of the forefathers/foremothers, the pioneers who have walked this path before me.

I have good business understanding on requirements , debug and fixing codes, develop custom applications though i use help on internet i can still write code.. Currently, they are asking dotnet core, react/angular, web api , microservices (this is completely new to me), design patterns. I did learn web api now, but still not a pro. Studied whats DI , dotnet core but there’s no hands on or project experience on these.\n\nI find it tough to match the latest technologies and get into a project or move to new company. Can you guys guide me on how to improve myself in dotnet and get up to date? Or any suggestions to shift to different skill that helps my career. ",

I'm jobless again and I've recently received feedback from what I suspect is an automated system that one of the things they prioritize is tenure. I think as I approach 8 years in, advance in my career, and seek more senior roles, this is going to become problematic.\n\nMy history looks like this:\n\n* Job 1 left after 1 year 6 months\n* Job 2 left after 1 year 7 months\n* Job 3 laid off after 1 year 10 months\n* Job 4 laid off after 1 year\n* Job 5 laid off after 1 year 3 months\n\nJob 3 was Twitter. I would have stayed there indefinitely if it hadn't become a train wreck and I and everyone I knew was let go. Since then each job has been a place I enjoyed but my employer makes the decision for me that me and many others can no longer work there.\n\nOn one hand I empathize with the desire for a candidate with longer tenure, but it's starting to feel rigged. I generally get good feedback from my managers and then I'm blindsided by what I assume are decisions made above them. It's a bit slow-going finding a new job after my most recent layoff and I'm wondering how much this might be holding me back. In addition to feeling quite jaded at this point, it feels rigged in the sense the industry has decided that employees are easily disposable and long term hiring decisions are not important, but they also want heavily tenured and battle-hardened engineers.\n\nI tend to get significantly above-average pay packages at these places compared to the industry median (but not necessarily compared to the company) and they have all been remote roles, so I wonder if that puts a target on my back, i.e., \"high-risk high-reward,\" but the last two companies aren't what I'd call \"big tech\". Against my better judgement I've included \"company-wide layoffs\" next to my last three roles because I worry employers might balk otherwise, but I wonder if there's anything else to be done in my situation, and what this all has cost me.",

The work isn’t great:\n\n* We don’t control the end-to-end user experience; our system is just a plugin within a larger website and thus are always dictated what to do.\n* The bar feels low compared to larger tech companies like Amazon; the team is fine with high latencies and error rates.\n* Rigid “standard practices\" around system design and strong pushback to do anything out of the usual.\n* A lack of professionalism in how colleagues and managers communicate and interact.\n* Limited customer base - A max of 1000 individuals, \\~0.1 TPS request rate.\n\nHowever:\n\n* The pay is great, **\\~110k euros + 100k USD stocks** (of the larger parent company which is performing great) equally vested over 3 years. I'll lose the stock if I leave now. The total comp comes out to **\\~140k** per year.\n\n**Squarespace**, based on my research, would likely offer better work, standards and culture.  \nHowever, the compensation is interesting.\n\nThey offer the same base salary (**\\~110k**) but instead of stocks, they offer **300k** options spread over 5 years at a strike price of $1 per share.  \n**If** the valuation triples as per the company vision, this will potentially grow to **900k** translating to a profit of **600k** profit **if** the company goes public.  \nThe catch is it is still paper money and doesn't mean anything without the company going public.\n\nI'm confused on what to do.",

Layoffs are non existent in this sector. \n\nHow would you rate this decision of mine ? \n\nPS - I am from India btw. ",

My former coworker / manager still works there, and I was curious if there was anything wrong with asking them for a reference or just anything that could have improve my chances. I already asked them if they’d be okay with giving me a reference earlier this summer and they agreed, I just didn’t know if it would be weirder if it was for the same company. And if it’s completely fine, how should go about asking them ? Thanks!",
