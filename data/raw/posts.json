        "author": "roey132",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.\n\nAs an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.\n\nTakes from my first project:\n\n1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff\n2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.\n3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.\n4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)\n5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.\n\nExample of my worst experience:\n\nI tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI.\n\n  \nLink to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\\_batch\\_data\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\n\n\\*Note\\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)\n\nHope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",

        "content": "Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.\n\nBut 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. \n\nI ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. \n\nI’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. \n\nI don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it. ",

There isn't even incremental processing of the facts, or anything for that matter. There is no SCD implementation. The only thing I have built a knack for is handling business logic. I feel like I am only picking up bad practices at this job and want to move on. \n\nI would appreciate some help in getting some direction on what skills or certifications I could pick up to move forward in my career. \n\nWhile there are lots of resources available on some concepts like Dimensional modelling on the internet, I am having a little trouble piecing it all together. Like - how are the layers organised? What is a Semantic Model? Does semantic modelling layer sit on top of a dimensional model? \n\nI would really appreciate it if someone could point me to some case studies of different organisations and their data warehouse.",

I am also an elder millennial and my family were especially early internet adopters, so I have been using the internet since 1997. My middle school had a weeks work of lesson plans teaching us how to coax relevant results out of Altavista and Lycos using quotes, booleans etc.\n\nHowever, I find that the internet is increasingly unusable and I have become a bit too dependent on CGPT. Like, I straight up can no longer find answers to questions. I can't even find webpages or documentation that I know exists, I just can't remember the URL. The old standby of adding \"reddit\" to the question doesn't work either, any post older than a month is all \"obtuse rubber goose up your nose with a rubber hose\" redacted slop.\n\nI can't find answers to questions on stackoverflow and a lot of documentation for python packages is essentially unusable (pyarrow, airflow core not provider packages). I have tried getting a subscription to a premium search engine (Kagi). It's marginally better than google but still extremely frustrating. \n\nSo, like....how do you get unstuck in the year 2025?

        "author": "Advanced-Average-514",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.\n\nWhen I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).\n\nBut, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.\n\nMy hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.\n\nAnyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too.\n\n  \nTLDR: I'm getting paid 72k with, working 40 hours a week, good benefits, not a ton of stress, 1 year of full time DE experience, should I be looking for more?",

        "author": "koldblade",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is mostly a question for experienced engineers / leads: was there a time when you've regretted going open source instead of building something in-house, or vica versa?\n\nFor context, at work we're mostly reading different databases, and some web apis, and load them to SQL server. So we decided on writing some lightweight wrappers for extract and load, and use those for SQL server. During my last EL task I've decided to use DLT for exploration, and maybe use our in-house solution for production.\n\nHere's the kicker: DLT took around 5 minutes for a 140k row table, which was processed in 10s with our wrappers (still way too long, working on optimizing it). So as much as initially I've hated implementijg our in-house solution, with all the weird edge cases, in the end I couldn't be happier. Not to mention no breaking changes, that could break our pipelines.\n\nLooking at the code for both implementations, it's obvious that DLT simply can't perform the same optimizations as we can, because it has less information about our environments. But these results are quite weird: DLT is the fastest ingestion tool we tested, and it can be easily beat in our specific use case, by an average-at-best set of programmers.\n\nBut I still feel unease, what if a new programmer comes to our team, and they can't be productive for extra 2 months? Was the fact that we can do big table ingestions in 2 minutes vs 1 hour worth the cost of extra 2-3 hours of work when inevitably a new type of source / sink comes in? What are some war stories? Some choices that you regret / greatly appreciate in hindsight? Especially a question for open source proponents: When do you decide that the cost of integrating between different open source solutions is greater than writing your own system, which is integrated by default - as you control everything.",

The Kafka cluster\nis provided by an external company, which also has a UI to see some data and\nsome metrics.\n\nNow, the more topics we have, the more our devs want to debug certain things and analytics people want to explore data. \nSo the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not \npossible. We have now explored other methods to do \"data exploration\":\n\n\n* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType \"decimal\" (wtf?)\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)\n* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways\n* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and \nconfiguration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and \nrequires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)\n* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.\n\nFor you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit \nsurprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature \nand widely adopted. \nAny tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic \nformat? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?\n\nA little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the \ndata as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, \nwhile using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow \nare big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability. I know that the \nArrow Java Implementation, can , supposedly,  deserialize Avro directly into \nArrow. But not the C/Python Implementation.\n\n",

        "author": "sanjayio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello Data Engineers 👋\n\nI've been scouting on the internet for the best and easiest way to setup **dbt Core 1.9.0 with Airflow 3.0** orchestration. I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.\n\nI'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. \n\n**Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.\n\nSo let's get started. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)\n- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. \n2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.\n3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.\n4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.\n5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.\n\n## Running Airflow Locally\n\n1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.\n2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.\n3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.\n\n## Running dbt Core Locally\n\nCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core\n\n```sh\npython3 -m venv dbt_venv\nsource dbt_venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nOptional, to create an alias\n\n```sh\nalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'\n```\n\nInstall dbt Core\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres\n```\n\nVerify Installation\n\n```sh\ndbt --version\n```\n\nCreate a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users/<yourusernamehere>/.dbt` directory and add the following content. \n\n```yaml\ndefault:\n  target: dev\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: postgres\n      host: localhost\n      port: 5432\n      user: your-postgres-username-here\n      password: your-postgres-password-here\n      dbname: public\n      schema: public\n```\n\nYou can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.\n\n```sh\ncd dbt/hello_world\ndbt compile\n```\n\n## Cleanup\n\nRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Generating fernet key\n\n```sh\npython3 -c \"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"\n```\n\nI hope this tutorial was useful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments section. \n\nHappy Coding!",

Our billing team has built a huge internal system that pulls data from various databases and ultimately generates invoice PDFs. Over time, it's become a very complex structure with dozens of Excel sheets, formulas, macros, and calculations.\n\nThe process often feels clunky and inefficient, especially because a lot of data still has to be copy-pasted manually between files.\n\nSome people have suggested rebuilding the whole system in Python, but I think that’s overkill for our needs, and we don’t have a large enough IT/dev team to maintain something like that.\n\nHowever, we do have a few strong data science people on the team, and I’ve been wondering if this could be a good case for Microsoft Fabric.\n\nCould we use Fabric to build a large data lake of all our datasets?\n\nHow would we keep these datasets updated in near real-time to avoid all the manual copy-pasting?\n\nCan Fabric somehow \"host\" the existing Excel logic, or would it be better to use Fabric to clean and prepare the data, and then keep the final invoicing logic in Excel?\n\n\nThe Excel-based system does work, but it's fragile and hard to maintain. We’re looking for ways to simplify data preparation, automate more of the process, and reduce errors.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or if anyone has gone through something similar!\n\nThanks!",

At that time, the ML/DS teams used AWS CLI or Boto3 to retrieve Parquet data from S3 for EDA or model development.\n\nHowever, as more data started being stored in Iceberg tables, the ML/DS teams began using Spark applications to access them. While using Spark for EDA isn’t a big issue, it becomes more complex when training models with PyTorch, since combining Spark, Iceberg, and PyTorch introduces additional complexity due to the JVM and Python interoperability.\n\nIn general, when ML/DS teams want to train models (mostly written in Python) using data stored in Iceberg tables, what are the common ways to load that data from Iceberg into their Python(Pytorch, ML) workflows?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I'm working on a POC using Snowflake as our data warehouse and trying to keep the architecture as simple as possible, while still being able to support our business needs. I’d love to get your thoughts, since this is our first time migrating to a modern data stack.\n\nThe idea is to use Snowpipes to load data into Snowflake from ADLS Gen2, where we land all our raw data. From there, we want to leverage dynamic tables to simplify orchestration and transformation. We’re only dealing with batch data for now so no streaming requirements.\n\nFor CI/CD, we’re planning to use either Azure DevOps or GitHub, using the Snowflake repository stage and we currently have three separate Snowflake accounts, so zero-copy cloning won’t be an option.\n\nThe files in ADLS will contain all columns from the source systems, but in Snowflake we’ll only keep the ones we actually need for reporting. Finally, for slowly changing dimensions, we're planning to use integer surrogate keys instead of hash keys.\n\nDo you think this setup is sufficient? I’m also considering using dbt, mainly for data quality testing and documentation. Since lineage is already available in Snowflake and we’re handling CI/CD externally, I'm wondering if there are still strong reasons to bring dbt into the stack. Any downsides or things I should keep in mind?\n\nAlso, I’m a bit concerned about orchestration. Without using a dedicated tool, we’re relying on dynamic tables and possibly Snowflake Tasks, but that doesn’t feel quite scalable long-term especially when it comes to backfills or more complex dependencies.\n\nSorry for the long post but any feedback would be super helpful!",

My ingestion experience consists of exporting CSVs from our source systems to SharePoint, then connecting to Power BI and transforming there. I got buy-in from management for a centralized data solution in AWS. We reached out to a couple of engineering teams and received two proposals. The first one proceeds with our original intent of building a warehouse in Redshift, while the second one aims for lakehouse architecture using S3/Athena/Iceberg/Glue. I had not even heard of a lakehouse before starting this project.  \n\nWe record our work across multiple cloud software and need to merge them into a single source of truth. We also need to store historical snapshots of our data, which we are not able to do currently. While structured, this internal data is not large. We do not generate even 1GB of data annually. I understand that such a data size is laughable for considering a managed warehouse. However, we plan on ingesting JSON files spanning hundreds of gigs every month. While I am sure that we will not need most of the data in those files, I still want to keep them in their original format just in case. Since I have been unable to peek inside these files, I will be exploring this data for the first time. I feel that the production data will only be a few gigs. We are also reconfiguring our Jira projects, so I worry that field deletions and schema changes would convolute a warehouse implementation.  \n\nWhile I would like to build this myself, I have no coding experience and we work with healthcare data so we would need security expertise as well. Thousands of dollars per month is out of the question at the moment, so I am looking for a cost-effective and scalable solution. I just wonder if Redshift or S3 + Athena is that solution. Oh, and we would hire an engineer to manage this solution.  \n\nThanks in advance for your time!",

As I work in a company who is reluctant to adopt new practices, and resistant to suggestions I feel a bit stuck on how to pivot.

I would say that my experience in these areas is expert level, although they do not lever any of the modern skills I see required in most job specs. I work with extremely messy data and in most cases it is a challenge to create clean analysis from this, which is why I find myself spending more time gathering the data than actually providing the end user with analysis.\n\nCan anybody provide suggestions on some specific things I can focus on portfolio wise that would help me move into DE.

From my understanding, parquets are formatted in a way to not load excess data when querying items inside nested structs as of 2.4sh.\n\nOtherwise, the alternative is splitting apart the data into 30-60 tables for each data type we have in our Iceberg tables to flatten out repeated fields. Without testing yet, I would presume queries are faster with nested structs than doing several one-many joins for usable data.\n\nThanks!",

I would really like to make sure that the transition/changes we will be implementing are not in fact introducing some anti-patterns...   \nIs there any better/more clean way of tackling it?  \n  \nThanks!

        "author": "SnooDogs4383",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks, I recently joined a consultancy where we manage data solutions for clients. My team primarily works on Databricks, and I was really impressed at first with Delta Live Tables (now called Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline) and Photon. It felt super intuitive, until I saw the $200 bill just from me testing it out. That was kinda absurd.\n\nAround the same time, I was optimizing a server for another team and stumbled onto DuckDB. I got pulled into a DuckDB rabbit hole. I loved how portable it is, and the idea of single-node compute vs. distributed jobs like Spark made a lot of sense. From what the DuckDB team claims, it can outperform Spark for datasets under \\~5TB, which covers most of what we do.\n\nThat got me thinking: Why not build a data platform where DuckDB is the compute engine, with the option to later switch to Spark (or something else) via an adaptor?\n\nHere’s the rough idea:\n\n1. Everything should work locally—compute and storage.\n2. Add adaptors to connect to any external data source or platform.\n3. Include tools that help design and stress-test data models (seriously, why do most platforms not have this built-in?).  \n\nI also saw that DuckDB Foundation released a new data lake standard that seems like a cleaner way to structure metadata compared to loose files on S3.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n* Databricks just announced **Lakeflow Connect** to integrate with lots of SaaS platforms.  \n* MotherDuck is about to announce **Estuary**, which sounds like it’ll offer similar functionality.  \n* DuckLake (MotherDuck’s implementation of the lake standard) looks promising too.  \n\nSo here’s my actual question:  \n**Is there room or real need for a local-first data lake platform?** One that starts local for speed, cost, and simplicity—but can scale to the cloud later?\n\nI know it sounds like a niche idea. But a lot of small businesses generate a fair amount of data and don’t have the tools or people to set up a proper warehouse. Maybe starting local-first makes it easier for developers to play around without worrying about getting billed every time they test something?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts. Is this just me dev dreaming, or something worth building?",

What you guys suggest doing? If I decide doing full CDC with a different architecture such as streaming, will bq have the same cost for doing full table scans trying to find the updated record? Is it bq just bad at this given its date-partition structure? Any suggestion to this one man de team\n\n",

Their inventory data was spread across 3 different databases, production schedules were in Excel sheets that people were emailing around, and quality control metrics were...well, let's just say they existed somewhere.\n\nThe real kicker? Leadership kept asking for \"real-time visibility\" into operations while we are sitting on data that's 2-3 days old by the time anyone sees it. Classic, right?\n\n**The main headaches we ran into:**\n\n* ERP system from early 2000s that basically spoke a different language than everything else\n* No standardized data formats between production, inventory, and quality systems\n* Manual processes everywhere where people were literally copy-pasting between systems\n* Zero version control on critical reports (nightmare fuel)\n* Compliance requirements that made everything 10x more complex\n\n**What broke during migration:**\n\n* Initial pipeline kept timing out on large historical data loads\n* Real-time dashboards were too slow because we tried to query everything live\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* Staged approach with data lake storage first\n* Batch processing for historical data, streaming for new stuff\n\nWe ended up going with Azure for the modernization but honestly the technical stack was the easy part. The real challenge was getting buy-in from operators who have been doing things the same way for 15+ years.\n\n**What I am curious about:** For those who have done similar manufacturing data consolidations, how did you handle the change management aspect? Did you do a big bang migration or phase it out gradually?\n\nAlso, anyone have experience with real-time analytics in manufacturing environments? We are looking at implementing live dashboards but worried about the performance impact on production systems.\n\nWe actually documented the whole journey in a whitepaper if anyone's interested. It covers the technical architecture, implementation challenges, and results. Happy to share if it helps others avoid some of the pitfalls we hit.",

But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.\n\nWe have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. \n\nNow, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually \"loading\" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. \n\nSo, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline).

        "content": "Hello guys,\n\nI built for my clients a repository containing a boilerplate of a data platform, it contains, jupyter, airflow, postgresql, lightdash and some libs installed. It's a docker compose, some ansible scripts and also some python files to glue all the components together, especially with SSO.\n\nIt's aimed at clients that want to have data analysis capabilities for small / medium data. Using it I'm able to deploy a \"data platform in a box\" in a few minutes and start exploring / processing data.\n\nMy company works by offering services on each tool of the platform, with a focus on ingesting and modelling especially to companies that don't have any data engineer.\n\nDo you think it's something that could interest members of the community ? (most of the companies I work with don't even have data engineers so it would not be a risky move for my business) If yes, I could spend the time to clean the code. Would it be interesting even if the requirement is to have a keycloak running somewhere ?\n\n",

I also did quite a bit of devops stuff, but mostly maintanance and bugfixing not developement. \n\nAnd now i am little unsure on where to move forward. I am kinda worried about ai pushing down headcounts and i would wanr to focus on things that are a little more ai resistant. I am currently planning on continhing as a data eng, i mostly read that cloud stuff and architecture is more future proof than like basic etl. And my question would be related to this, since cloud services are well documented and there are many examples online, would it truly be more ai resistant. I understand the cost and archjtecture aspect of it but how many architects are needed.\n\nI am internally also conflicted with this idea because there came tools before that were supposed to make things simpler like terraform yet they didnt really reduce the headcount as far as I know. And than I ask myself what would be different in LLm tools compared to ton of past tools even like IDEs\n\nSorry id the question is stupid i am still entry level and would like to hear some more experienced viewpoints.",

        "author": "Away-Violinist3104",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks – my friend and I have been thinking a lot about the communication overhead between business stakeholders and data engineers when it comes to building data pipelines. From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.\n\nWe’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:\n\n* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).\n* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.\n* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.\n* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.\n* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve \n\nThis way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.\n\nWe’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another \"imagined problem\".\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?\n* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?\n* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?\n\nAny perspectives would be appreciated!",

        "content": "Hey, I would just like to open by saying this post is extremely biased and selfish in nature. Now with that in mind, I work at a bank as a Student Data Engineer while doing an Msc in Data Engineering.\n\nMy team consists of my supervisor and myself. He is a Data Analyst that doesn't have much technical expertise (just some Python and SQL knowledge but for doing basic things).\n\nWe handle data at a monthly granularity level. When I was brought in 11 months ago, the needs weren't well defined (in fact they weren't defined at all). Since then, we've been slowly gaining more clarity. Our work now mainly consists of exporting data from SAP Business Objects, doing Extract-Transform in Python and exporting aggregates (typed cleansed joined data). This is in fact what I did. He then uses the aggregates to do some dashboarding in Excel. Now he started using Power BI for dashboarding.\n\nI suggested moving to an Airbyte->DW->DBT ELT pipeline. I'm implementing a POC for this purpose. But my supervisor asked if it would be better to use Alteryx as an ETL tool instead. His motives are that he wants us to remain a business oriented team not a technical one that implements and maintains technical solutions, another motive of his is that the data isn't voluminous enough to warrant the approach I suggested (Most of our source excel files are less than 100k rows with one being less than 150k rows and another being at more than 1.5M rows)\n\nMy motives on the other hand are why I said this post is selfish. I plan to use this as a Final Year Project. And, I feel like this would advance my career (improve my CV) better than Alteryx which I feel is more targeted towards Data Analysts who like Drag-and-Drop UIs and no code quality of life approaches.\n\nOne point I know my approach beats out Alteryx in is auditability. It is important to document the transformations our data goes through and I feel that that is more easily done and ensured with my approach.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Am I too selfish in what I'm doing or is it ok (considering I'm going to soon be freshly graduated and really want to be able to show this 14 month long experience as genuine, real work that will be relevant to the type of positions I would be targeting) ?\n2. How do I convince my supervisor of my approach ?",

Like, what made the switch from “I’m just reading stuff” to “I actually understand what I’m doing”?\n\nMost advice out there is the same laundry list: spaced repetition, Pomodoro, flashcards, blah blah. But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?\n\nI think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.\n\nPersonally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was.

        "author": "peterlinddk",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I don't know if this will reach those who need it the most, but I've seen a lot of posts from people being confused as to which programming language to choose, asking how long it will take to learn something, asking when you'll have learned enough to learn more or get a job. But unfortunately those questions can't really be answered - but fortunately it doesn't really matter!\n\nRemember that a programming language is *a language* \\- and just like other languages created by humans, they are used to convey ideas to other humans. The computer doesn't care about the language you program it in, it only understands machine code, so the moment your program compiles you are basically free to throw away the source code. Except you don't do that, because you might want to change things later, or have someone else look at the code, another human, or a large language model, that also (tries to) understand language.\n\nSo learning a programming language is a lot like learning any other language - there are syntax rules, grammar, different classes of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and there are all the words in the language. A lot of them added by other humans, and in most cases still being added.\n\nIf you managed to learn English (or whatever other secondary language you learnt) by reading the definition of the grammar and syntax, committing all the special cases to memory, and memorizing every single word, well, then maybe that will also work for you when learning programming! - But most of us didn't learn it that way, we picked up a few words, understood the sentence-structure, partly, tried to use the language, spoke and wrote, and made a lot of mistakes. And gradually we got better and better, learned more \"rules\" and even more exceptions to those rules, and picked up a lot of new words as we went along.\n\nNobody has ever \"completed\" learning English - for one the language always changes, and always has, and also there are simply to many words, to many dialects even, to ever learn everything.\n\nSame goes for programming - you will probably never complete any language, there will always be something new to learn, or something that *you* use so rarely that you forget about it, and have to look it up on the rare occasions that you *do* need it.\n\nBut that shouldn't discourage you from learning other languages - if you have to travel to France or Spain, you'll probably need to learn some French or Spanish, and you might even like it so much that you decide to stay and learn more - while still keeping your English, maybe forgetting a bit more than before, but never mind, you still know how to look it up!\n\n\n\nThere are some grammar rules that you'll never understand, but somehow manage to use anyways. A lot of languages have gendered words, with very unspecific rules about why a specific word is one gender, but you'll get used to it \"sounding wrong\" when you use the wrong one. Same in programming, you might not be able to fully comprehend async or lambdas or closure, but just use it to write code where it \"sounds right\". A number of books and blogposts will try to invent rules to remember, but often they are even more difficult to understand, and also quite often simply wrong. So you'll get by and just \"do programming\" always feeling that you don't fully understand everything.\n\nLike you don't fully understand everything in the languages you write or speak - like you haven't meticulously memorized every single word, but somehow still use them. \n\n  \nAnd some people find it easy to adapt to new languages, while others keep talking the dialect of their hometown even after having lived everywhere else their entire life. Sometimes you hear or read a word, and immediately understand it, other times you'll struggle your entire career with the spelling or pronouncination of some. The experience is different for everyone, and there is no set speed for how anything takes anyone else to learn.\n\nI hope that those of you fixating on languages will read and understand this - and maybe stop worrying so much, and get going using the languages - the programming languages - to actually build something. Not important original masterpieces, just small stories where you use the language as you are learning.",

But I feel like it’s just unavoidable. \n\nAt the same time with all the LLMs going around and vibe coding, I see students who vibe code websites under a day which would take me at least a few days to create all while them not even having a grasp of what the code is about.

I’m really interested in building a solid career in the IT field, but with so many programming languages out there, I’m a bit confused about where to start and which one to focus on.\n\nSo far, I’ve been exploring a few basics, but I want to know:\n\n* **Which programming language should I prioritize** for a good future in the IT industry?\n* Should I focus more on **web development, app development, data science, or something else**?\n* Is it better to master one language or learn a bit of multiple ones in the beginning?\n\nI would really appreciate suggestions or guidance from those who’ve been through this journey or are currently working in the field. Any roadmap or personal advice would help a lot!\n\nThanks in advance!",

How likely is it that they will give me some leetcode problem (its not a multi million company its a smaller company)... how do I prepare for it now? Will they even ask me some technical questions again if they already asked me some?

Looking for advice on the best next step in my programming journey.\n\n**Background:** 37 y/o attorney with a Bachelors from Duke but in a non-STEM field. Spent the last 3 years doing MIT's undergrad Computer Science curriculum as well as the Odin Project. I would say I have an intermediate-level understanding of a lot of the concepts you would typically learn in an undergrad CS curriculum like OOP, DSA (basic concepts like DFS, BFS, linked lists, etc. as well as some slightly more advanced concepts like skip lists, VEB trees, linear programming, etc.), basic hardness proofs, discrete math, basic computer architecture, etc. Unfortunately because I went the entirely self-taught route, aside from portfolio projects I don't have any sort of credential to demonstrate this knowledge (for this reason, I'd recommend people avoid going that route if they can help it).\n\n**Goals:** At a minimum, I'd like to be able to sit for the patent bar and potentially leverage that to work more with clients in the tech industry. The dream scenario would be to make a career switch to software engineering but given my age and the state of the market I know that is extremely unlikely, so more focused on how I could leverage this for my law practice.\n\n**Path I'm Considering:** Am I crazy for thinking that Western Governors University is a logical next step for me? It's inexpensive, it seems like I might be able to grind through the curriculum pretty quick, and then I would at least have the Bachelors in CS box checked. The downside is that some of the stuff I read elsewhere on Reddit makes it sound like a diploma mill. But other online bachelors are much more expensive and might take me over 2 years to finish, and at the end of the day they are still online degrees so not sure they would even carry that much more weight anyway. \n\nI'm also really intrigued by Georgia Tech's OMSCS, but surprisingly it sounds like it would *not* be enough for me to sit for the patent bar because it's a Masters not a Bachelors. However, if I could knock out WGU in the next 6-9 months I could apply to GT in the Spring if I decide I want to go that route, so that's maybe another benefit of taking the WGU path.\n\nFor those who have gone to WGU or who are knowledgeable about the various options for an online bachelors in CS, is WGU really so much worse than other online programs that it is worth the extra time and money to do another program? Or am I right for thinking that it makes sense for someone in my position?\n\n",

        "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been on reddit for a while, mostly just reading and learning from other people's stories. But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.**\n\n**Warning: wall of text.**\n\nI graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.\n\nI started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.\n\nAlso, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.\n\nOver time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.\n\nWith how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet. I'm still afraid to apply for senior roles.",

I live in one of the biggest cities (Poznań).\n\nOver the past four years, I’ve been teaching myself programming, primarily working with the React stack.\n\nDue to some health challenges, it was tough to commit to a full-time job, so I kept going through freelancing and one-off projects while continuing to improve my skills. Eventually, I realized freelancing wasn't the right long-term path for me, so I decided to pursue full-time employment.\n\nWhile doing some research, I came across tons of discouraging posts claiming that landing an entry-level dev job is almost impossible these days. Most of these were about the US market - not the EU - so I was wondering:\n\nIs there a big difference between the two in terms of how hard it is to land a job and what kind of skills are expected?\n\nI get that a lot of these comments probably come from people who gave up before actually breaking into the industry - but they still made me very anxious.\n\nI’m not chasing amazing benefits or a six-figure salary - I just want a stable job doing what I enjoy, with room to grow and improve.\n\nNot gonna lie, doomscrolling through programming subs has left me feeling genuinely depressed this past week, I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nAt one point, I even started questioning whether I should switch fields entirely, just because it felt like I might end up stuck in the job-hunting loop forever.\n\nIs it really that bad these days, even if you've got the time and space to grind and stay consistent? \n",

I’ve been programming for about two years and just started my first job as a backend developer a couple of weeks ago.

I feel like I’m writing terrible, unstructured code because I have no idea if I’m even heading in the right direction. I can’t properly test anything, which makes me feel even worse. I’ve been so stressed that I’ve cried and even started doubting if I made the right career choice.\n\n**My main questions:**\n\n1. How do you approach projects with unclear requirements when you’re working solo?\n2. How do you make something at least *somewhat* testable when you don’t have any infrastructure or environment to rely on?\n3. If you’ve experienced this kind of anxiety or burnout early in your career, how did you handle it and regain some confidence?\n\nAny advice, personal stories, or even just “this is normal, breathe” would mean a lot.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "As the title states, I would call myself a C++ programmer because it’s the main language I use.  Of course, there are others I use, like C, Java, TS, python, etc.  but I have stuck to C++ for so long because after graduating (I’m in my final year of CS bachelors), I want to work in systems programming/high performance systems programming (particularly computer graphics).  As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc.  \n\nBut, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases.  Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong.  Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it.  No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.\n\nOf course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on.  My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff.  I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff.  But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with it\n\nSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++? Or is there a good alternative to C++?",

        "author": "franzz4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:\n\n**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.\n\n**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.\n\nAfter learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?**  \nFrom what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:\n\n* Python\n* Java\n* C#\n* Go\n* Rust\n\nI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",

It will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right? The program might keep running and have an unexpected bug/crash deep down the road unexpectedly. \n\nI have asked some LLMs and they recommended this macro:\n\n    #define SAFE_FREE(ptr) do { free(ptr); ptr = NULL; } while(0)\n\nThis seems safer *to me* compared to calling free directly, because I already forgot to set pointers to NULL after freeing them. I like this idea, but I'm not immediately using it because I'm a noob and am suspicious.\n\nI came here to ask this: Is there a catch here? Is there any downside to always using this macro, rather than always writing 2 lines manually?\n\n`free(ptr); ptr = NULL;`\n\n",

(although text is preferred)\n\nI don't mind if it starts from the basics, that would be fine as a little refresher and to see what java does differently than other languages, I can always skip what I already know.\n\nAlso its a small annoyance, not really a problem, but I don't like sites that offer free resources or tutorials and stuff but then force you to create an account. Although if its worth it for what they offer and they have good resources that's fine, but I just don't like having to create 5 different accounts for a bunch of different services.  \n\n\nI know its unlikely anyone will know it but a while ago (might have been on a different subreddit) there was someone who posted a website they were making to teach others java and it was pretty nice, plain text, some examples with syntax highlighting, but no adds or images that I had noticed, just text.\n\nIf anyone happens to know remember the site it would be neat if you could comment the link thanks.\n\n\nEdit: \njust as context for the type of site I would (ideally) like to look for. I really liked beej's programming guides which I found through another reddit post but unfortunately there is no java guide as of yet.\n",

And from that backend (let's say it's hosted for free on Vercel), I should be able to make automatic daily API calls with a cron job and store that data on a database that can be used whenever I make a request from my frontend? \n\nSo in short, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the front end back end interaction. From my understanding, it's basically: Github Front End HTTP request to Back End hosted not on github, then the backend sends back some queried data from the database that is automatically updating every day?\n\n",

I can make APIs and I understand HTTP to a good extent and all that stuff, I can make CRUD APIs if I wanted. But I also have this itch to make more complex projects, things that will teach me more than just language or library features. For example, I want to try to make a mini Express.js with the Node HTTP module, but when I try to think of how I would even start this project my mind just goes blank. I feel like I should know this, but I don't.\n\nI've been building APIs in raw Node.js, so I think I should at least be able to come up with some sort of abstraction around the HTTP module, kind of like what express does with app.get() and more. But for some reason, I can't. It's like I can understand HTTP, custom middleware, routing, and serving static files, but when I want to make something a step-up from basic CRUD APIs, I feel like I'm back to square one and I actually haven't learned anything. And it isn't just about this project, it's in general. For example, if I go to the \"Project based learning\" github repo and check out the Node section, it says things like \"Build a real-time Markdown editor in Node.js\", \"build a web framework\", \"build a real-time serverless GraphQL API with WebSockets on AWS\". I feel like I should maybe have SOME idea as to what things I would need to do, but I can't even think of one and if I do then I'll realize it's not a perfect solution and then I have to go back and think about it.

Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.\n\nThe AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.\n\nThis wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.\n\nWhat really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.\n\nI’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.\n\nI’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? What are you doing to adapt? How are you thinking about the future of our field?",

        "content": "After 13 years in software development, I was laid off this past April. And while it hurt, it also felt like a strange kind of relief.\n\nThe last few years were brutal with constant pressure, toxic teams, and impossible deadlines. I kept telling myself I still loved coding, but the truth is, the spark has been gone for a while. I’m burned out, drained, and the thought of jumping into another dev job just fills me with dread.\n\nI want out, not out of tech necessarily, but out of pure software development. I’m tired of the grind, the endless new frameworks, the feeling that my work is just disappearing into the void.\n\nBut I feel stuck. My whole identity has been “software developer” for so long. I don’t know how to reframe my skills, or even what I’m qualified for outside of coding all day. Starting over is scary, and I don’t know where to begin.\n\nHave any of you made a big pivot after burnout or layoffs? What roles still leverage your technical background, but offer something more sustainable, more human? I’m looking at things like solutions architecture or tech-focused product roles, but I’m open to anything that doesn’t suck the life out of me again.",

I’m starting to seriously question whether this path is even viable anymore, at least in the near term.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking:\n\nIs it worth pivoting to a different career entirely?\n\nWhat industries (tech-adjacent or not) are more resilient or growing right now?\n\nHas anyone here successfully transitioned out of SWE, and what did that look like?\n\nHow do you even start exploring a new path when you’re already burned out and disillusioned?\n\nShould I just try to wait this market out, even if it means stagnating longer?\n\n\nI’d really appreciate any perspectives, especially from people who’ve made a similar pivot — or are considering one.\n\nEDIT - Backstory: I landed a Junior SWE role back in 2021 for an established crypto company that lasted a year. (I quit for various reasons.) I considered myself a mid-level dev at this point. According to my superiors, I did an excellent job throughout. Upon re-entering the job market, I blew through my savings while adding 9 Google Certifications, with no success. Now I'm a car salesman just to make ends meet.\n\nI am also working part-time for a seed-stage startup. I am not being paid as they are pre-funding.",

However I don't live and breathe code. I do what I need to, to do an excellent job at work, but I do not spend my free time looking forward to exploring more tech stacks and debugging.\n\nI’ve heard a lot of advice, from people who are successful, saying those who really succeed in tech — or land the best internships and long-term roles — tend to be the ones who are deeply passionate and treat coding as a hobby. I've seen them first hand. These were the people who are multi times top hackathon winners throughout school, continuously drilled hard into building an amazing portfolio, and some even started their own company before grad. All this sets them up for getting the best internships and raises the bar skyhigh for the rest of us.\n\nI've received the literal following words of advice from a staff engineer (self-taught since little, loves it like his hobby) at Shopify: \"If you are not passionate about the knowledge and craft, get out of here you will burn out too easily\"\n\nI would like to ask for everyone's honest opinion, for example :\n\n* You are the very passionate and driven, and have seen how others who just \"work to live\" tends to do (will they get pushed out?)\n* Or you are not in the  \"live and breathe code\" camp, and are willing to share how you find it and how you find balance",

        "content": "I am interviewing for the first time in >10 years. After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.\n\nPrior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.\n\nIn conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say \"oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here.\" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. \n\nThere are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).\n\nRegardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. \n\nI'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc? Are there companies that I should be looking at? \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and for any feedback or advice you can offer. Best of luck out there on your interview loops!",

        "title": "Differences I see from my experience in Defense, MAANG and Big tech industries.",
        "author": "Broad-Cranberry-9050",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\nIm 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent 3 years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after 3 months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses.  I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.\n\nHere are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:\n\n# Onboarding:\n\nDefense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.\n\nFAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.\n\nCurrent: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.\n\n# work life balance:\n\nDefense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a \"extra time\" bank and use it as future PTO.\n\nFAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.\n\nCurrent - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a \"work late\" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.\n\n# Expectiations:\n\nDefense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.\n\nFAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.\n\nCurrent - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was \"if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance\".\n\n# Time and meetings:\n\nDefense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.\n\nFAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.\n\nCurrent - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.\n\nEdit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was. \n\n# Interview:\n\nDefense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like \"what is OOP?\" or how I would design a simple code.\n\nFAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet. \n\nBig tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you think AI will be replacing you as an engineer, you are probably wildly overestimating the AI, or underestimating yourself. Let me explain.\n\nThe best AI cannot even do 10% of my job as a senior software engineer I estimate. And there are hard problems which prevent them from doing any better, not in the least of which is that they already ran out of training data. They are also burning through billions with no profitability in sight, almost as quickly as they are burning through natural resources such as water, electricity and chips. Not even to mention the hardest problem which is that it is a machine (or rather, routine), not a sentient being with creativity. It will always think \"inside the box\" even if that box appears to be very large. While they are at it, they hallucinate quite a good percentage of their answers as well, making them critically flawed for even the more mundane tasks without tight supervision. None of these problems have a solution in the LLM paradigm. \n\nLLMs for coding is a square peg for a round hole. People tend to think that due to AI being a program that it naturally must be good at programming, but it really doesn't work that way. It is the engineers that make the program, not the other way around. They are far better at stuff like writing and marketing, but even there it is still a tool at best and not replacing any human directly. Yes, it can replace humans indirectly through efficiency gains but only up till a point. In the long term, the added productivity gained from using the tool should merit hiring more people, so this would lead to more jobs, not less.\n\nThe reason we are seeing so many layoffs right now is simply due to the post-pandemic slump. Companies hired like crazy, had all kinds of fiscal incentives and the demand was at an all time high. Now all these factors have been reversed and the market is correcting. Also, the psychopathic tendency to value investors over people has increased warranting even more cost cutting measures disguised as AI efficiency gains. That's why it is so loved by investors, it's a carte blanche to fire people and \"trim the fat\" as they put it. For the same reason, Microsoft's CEO is spouting nonsense that XX% of the code is already written by AI. It's not true, but it raises the stock price like clockwork, and that’s the primary mission of a CEO of a large public company.\n\ntl;dr AI is mostly a grift artificially kept afloat by investor billions which are quickly running out",

I like my current team, but there is little to no room for growth here.\n\nWhat’s pushing me to seriously consider the offer is that there might very likely be an involuntary layoff coming later and the severance for those is roughly 2 months of salary.\n\nMy main concern is: What if I can’t find a new job within 6 months? The market feels shaky, and I’m not sure how long the job search might take, especially given my relatively short experience.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? Would you take the package, or is it too risky right now? What factors should I weigh before making a decision?\n\nEdit: If I do take the package, my plan is to grind Leetcode full-time and look for a better role. I’ve already been preparing the last few months after realizing there’s really no path for promotion here and there was already 1 round of layoff happened earlier this year. That said, I’ve been inconsistent due to my full-time workload. Taking the package feels like a rare opportunity to fully focus on job hunting and leveling up, but I’m still nervous about the risk of not landing a new role within 6 months.",

I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. \n\nThe good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.\n\nThe bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email.   \n\nI am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how \"real\" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nI plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long. So I guess I'm in that phase where I feel too old and outdated to do anything else but still too young to retire... but doing nothing is becoming scarier by the day.",

Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve. I'm stagnating, and have been for a while.\n\nThe problem is that I need to make more money. And I don't know where to start. I'm looking for other roles but I'm getting no bites. I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews. But I did flop the ones I got, other than my current job, of course. \n\nNow, the question is this: if I want FAANG to look at my resume a year from now, what do I have to do? Hell, it doesn't even have to be FAANG. Any tech company would be enough. Or even any reputable company even. How can I save myself from being out of a job in a year and having to spend 6 months looking for another one?",

Always put up with long nights, long code reviews, etc. The whole nine yards. But, in the real world, working hard doesn't mean jack shit if it doesn't produce good results. Or, at least, the results your boss wants in the timely manner that they please. So I was always on the disappointing end of my boss. There was never a time when I was good enough for him. I always felt... mediocre. And this isn't to pin anything on my boss or whatever. I'm just saying that I wasn't able to live up to his expectations.\n\nI lost a lot of sleep over the fact that I was just never good enough; I was never off of work mode, due to the anxiety and the constant self-deprecation. There were even nights when I'd run to the toilet for a quick vomit session due to the stress.\n\nThere was always something to complain about. Something to say about my not being good at this or that. \"Why did you do it like this?\" and \"You definitely had AI write up this code, didn't you?\" (no, I didn't). Despite it all, I still tried. I tried my darnedest. I grit my teeth and took everything as feedback and always thanked him. I always tried applying what I was told. I always admitted when I fell short, never pushing back or disrespecting my boss due to my feelings or ego being hurt. I always took everything on the chin. But it always ate at me. So, of course, I snapped. I told my boss that I was quitting cold turkey. Why? It was the only way out of the intense burnout that I could see.\n\nTo my surprise, he didn't want me to quit. But of course. It costs money to find, hire, and train a new engineer, and it's risky when you don't really know what that new engineer could be capable of (or not), as opposed to the engineer that you already have and are familiar with. So I'm not surprised. But I've known my boss for a while now. Me revoking my quitting was not going to solve anything for *me*. Maybe it would've in the short-term at my job, but I know that things would've just gone back to how they always were. That's how life rolls. So I doubled down and told him that I was not open to changing my mind.\n\nI'm going to be moving back in with my parents as soon as possible. Don't know when that is yet. I'm still... going through the motions. But, for now, I'm jobless. I'm in a weird place right now, emotionally, where I feel very relaxed and liberated in that I no longer have to put up with the stress that I did at work. But, at the same time, I'm afraid of whether or not I'll get work at all anytime soon. I'm afraid of whether or not this was a good call.\n\nBut, the way things were, I knew the one answer that I needed at the time: A break from work. A long break. A few months would be nice.\n\nRegardless, this is where I'm at right now.\n\nHow's *your* work life? lol",

The work is more niche (GPU driver, kernel debugging).\n* Option 2: Higher paid position at a different company where I'd be working on a modern C++ codebase (the company is smaller and isn't as well known but the staff is apparently quite elite). After one year they allow remote work + give a significant raise in salary.\n\nThe key issue here is that the first role is almost exclusively focused on debugging driver/GPU issues and there is little to no implementation to be done. I imagine that I would become something of a linux kernel / GPU driver guru after some time of doing this kind of work.\n\nThe other role pays better (especially after the one year re-negotiation) and allows for remote work but it's more of a regular C++ SWE engineering implementation job, after a year this would be \\~45k euro at google (net of tax) vs \\~75k euro (net of tax) at the other company.\n\nMy two questions to people who have experience in the industry are:\n\n1. Would having google in my CV have a significant impact on my career compared to experience at some other company?\n2. Could doing no implementation and essentially only debugging be dertimental to my engineering skills or actually help me grow? I will add that I already know C++ pretty well so I don't believe I could grow all that much in terms of pure C++ skills.\n\nI would really appreciate some input.",

No complaints there.\n\nBut for real design or new features? It’s like pair programming with an overeager intern who refuses to say “I don’t know.” It’ll confidently scaffold something that compiles but is subtly wrong in ways that bite you later. Error handling missing. Boundaries between services fuzzy. Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.\n\nIt’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.\n\nI’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. \n\nAnyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc.

For the past 1.5 years, my old manager asked me to work with another team which is more Data science/Data engineering related. It's more backend and data science-oriented. I didn't have any prior data science experience, but the codebase was manageable, and most of my tasks involved fixing bugs or building straightforward features without  deep DS knowledge.\n\nRecently, my manager asked me if I wanted to change my job title to reflect my current role, I agreed. But to officially \"transfer\", I had to pass a Python coding test. I was surprised since by this point I'd already shipped multiple features, fixed a shit ton of bugs, but went ahead anyway.\n\nThe first test went super badly lol, questions about two-sum, basic string manipulation, pandas, and numpy threw me off. I felt terrible and asked for a retake. I studied pandas thoroughly as that was the one thing I had no experience in, but the second test didn't even have pandas questions, it had a simple fizzbuzz-type problem, some question regarding numpys again (which I got right, but I hadn't converted the original array to np.array, which got me a zero lol), For the fizz buzz type question, I messed up badly by using `if` instead of `elif`.\n\nI asked for one last try. The third test (10) questions were incredilby easy, I thought they felt pity for me lol, then came question 11 and 12, 11 had pass some argument or something to a parser, I honestly didn't even understand the question and 12 had me converting a sentence to numbers, like tokenization. I got the logic right, but couldn't remember the syntax for removing punctuation. Unfortunately, CoderPad doesn't give partial credit, so I failed again. Now I'm seriously doubting my abilities. In my mind, its like I can just look up this information ( syntax about removing punctuation) is it really fair for me to get a zero on this?\n\nEven though my manager has had no complaints and my performance reviews have been good, I'm suddenly experiencing major imposter syndrome. Missing these simple questions is making me spiral. I'm worried that without the title change, I won't get promoted, or worse, might lose my job.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. The self-doubt is really impacting my productivity and emotional state\n\nEDIT: My day to day doesn't really involve lot of coding nowadays, its mostly shipping features from existing codebase and just migrating it with some minor adjustments. Fixing bugs and talking with the stakeholders to see what kind of results are they expecting. Even when I do this, I can always test/debug, but its pretty much not possible to debug on the 'coderpad' tests. ",

If all hands presentations are any indicator, my company is really drinking the \"Pivot to AI as a business model\" Kool Aid.

I make great pay, well above 6 figures, have 5-6 weeks of PTO, great retirement benefits and health insurance, all that boring but great stuff. But for all of my 5 years, I’ve always had an on-call rotation.\n\nIn this current position, it’s 9am-9pm, Monday through Sunday, once every 4 weeks. Most times, nothing happens. But the reality is that I have to always be ready for something to happen. I’ve worked in 3 different positions since graduating, and all had on-call rotations. It feels like it’s everywhere for systems engineers.\n\nIt feels so aggravating at times. For one out of every 4 weeks, I can’t go out to dinner, I can’t go to a concert, I can’t have a few drinks, and I can’t go do fun weekend activities, because I have to be within 15-30 minutes of a response time in the unlikely event that something goes wrong.\n\nUsually, everything is fine, and there are no issues. Which, I’m grateful for. But it feels tough when my friends want to plan to go to the beach with our boyfriends on a Saturday, and I have to say no because I need to be somewhere with WiFi in case things go awry.\n\nIt feels like such a champagne problem; I’m making more than double what any of my other friends make, and I have more money saved for retirement than most people 10 years older than me do. So it feels incredibly entitled to be bitching about this. But I feel like I’m constantly avoiding fun things during my “free time” because I need to be ready for a server to go down that most likely will not go down.",

Every framework or library we produce aims to reduce the amount of work we have to spend to achieve some result.\n\nThe western world represents  15-20% of the population, and we can imagine the remaining 80% catching up will keep on producing more and more engineers as years go by, especially as long as IT is considered the holy grail of sure employment and high pay.\n\nWith software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ? A moment where, full stop, we'll have too many CS trained people, and every extra million trained CS graduate will mean an extra million CS trained person not working in a CS related field.

Can you recommend something, either for just React for now, or for React + Node? I was thinking of anything I can complete within a few weeks, ideally not much more than that.\n\nSo far I've been considering Meta's [React Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-react-specialization) on Coursera, or maybe IBM's [JavaScript Programming with React, Node & MongoDB Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/javascript-programming-with-react-node-mongodb?specialization=meta-front-end-developer), also on Coursera. Someone else on a different subreddit recommended the [Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, which looks comprehensive and touches many modern technologies I am not familiar with, but which could be overkill for someone who is already a developer, I guess.\n\nPlease, I know it might be a boring question, but can you please offer some guidance? Again, what I want is:\n\n* Learning about React and Node (or, first one thing and then the other one) \n* A reputable certificate to add to my resume and Linkedin profile \n* Ideally, an endeavor that requires not more than a few weeks (a couple of months would be my absolute max)",

Web dev is good and pays the bills, I'm comfortable enough that I can afford a trip every now and then while taking out the gf, but I'd much rather work with something I can see and touch.\n\nThe obvious suggestion is blue-collar work, but I'd like to use my programming experience somehow, and was wondering what gateways / courses I could start getting into to facilitate that transition. My experience as web dev is solid, but things like micro-controllers and such I have any (although I have worked with C++).\n\nAnyone can suggest a potential gateway for that? I have a degree in Systems Engineering and I don't mind learning and working, I've done it all these years, but I really want to transition into a role that requires me to be more present and still pays well/decently.

Right now i know basic python ( functions, for loops, numpy, matplotlib, dictionaries, etc). in other words, a beginner. So my question is as follows: given that i will have to teach myself the CS fundamentals, what’s the best path to take? What languages do I need to know, and what resources would you recommend to effectively learn them? As for projects, after my class is done, i will create a LA calculator and a mass-spring model( differential equations). This will integrate my math knowledge with coding, and will be good for me to put on GitHub. Beyond that, i know there’s Leetcode, which is good because i learn best by doing practice problems. My stretch goal is to get a summer 2026 internship in CS, no matter how small. I know that since i’m late to the party, i will have to start small. this is fine by me, i just need my foot in the door.

Don't really like the job and my team isn't technical at all.\n\n# Option 2: Move to Canada for Waterloo’s in-person MEng (includes a co-op term)\n\n* **Cost:** Tuition plus rent and living costs in Waterloo, so I would burn savings (but I can afford it)\n* **Upside:** Waterloo’s name carries weight, and the co-op cycle should drop me into genuine dev roles and help me build a network in Canadian tech\n* **Downside:** Two years of full-time study at age 24, plus the chance I still end up fighting for the same entry-level SWE spots afterward. And the job market is not great so it's a risk.\n\n# About me\n\n* Canadian citizen, CS undergrad (was originally in DS and had my internships in that)\n* Part-time work with two early-stage US startups\n* Contributing to AI research in my spare hours to bulk up the résumé\n* Goal: Land a software engineering job in Canada or the US within the next couple of years\n\n# Anything else I should weigh before picking comfort now versus a riskier move that might unlock better opportunities later?\n\n**What would you do if you were in my shoes?**",

I've recently discovered that AI is really cool and it goes way beyond using chat for my homework assignments lol, so I've been researching a lot about careers in AI and found that I was particularly interested in ML!\n\nI majored in AI my freshman year at Purdue - West Lafayette, and now I've transferred to Rutgers - New Brunswick for the rest of my college career majoring in Data Science. I'm planning to graduate in 3.5 to 3 years, and so far, I'm on track to do so.\n\nMy most relevant courses are a data engineering in python course, a general OOP course, calc 2, stats 2, and discrete math. I have an unpaid \"internship\" at some fintech startup this summer where I used \"python and AI agent tools to automate workflows\", but we don't really do anything so that's basically just resume filler.\n\nMy main \"experience\" is from doing projects on my own. I listed them below:\n\n1. I made a linear regression model from scratch and trained it on the WHO life expectancy data, and found it matched scikit-learn's model pretty much exactly.\n2. I fine-tuned an open-source LLM on better completing inspirational English quotes and pushed it to HuggingFace.\n3. I'm currently working on this but I'm almost done; but I'm implementing the transformer architecture described in the research paper \"Attention is All You Need\" from scratch.\n\nI have heard usually people start off as data engineers/scientists and work their way up to becoming an ML engineer, and I know that you need knowledge with cloud services, containerization, generally good engineering practices, etc. etc. I'm sure you need solid DSA skills too.\n\nGiven my background, I was basically wondering what my next steps are here. Obviously I'd love to secure a more relevant, paid internship, but beyond that, what do I need to do in order to achieve my end goal? What things should I focus on at what times in order to best optimize my career path for the future?\n\nI'd really appreciate whatever advice you guys give, because I really want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. Thank you!",

        "content": "[US Based] Got my BS in SofDev and Security from a not well-known school, and I’ve started applying like crazy. I got a couple responses, but nothing guaranteed of course, as I’ve got no real world experience. So, my question is, what could I do moving forward to pad up the resume? \n\nI’ve seen people say they could care less about certificates, but surely some have to have some sort of value.(?) For example certs in AWS, Kubernetes, Oracle, cloud, etc. for gaining detailed familiarity on tool and environments an organization might use?\n\nI’ve seen the usual recommendation of creating something that is impressive and unique to show off your talent. I definitely need to get to this as my university’s assignments were not very impressive, but I also like the idea of getting something tangible like a certificate.\n\nMy current company is kind of tech related and offers all the study materials for free for practically all certs available. I just have to pay for the test I think. So, paying for a cert is not an issue. \n\nCertificates won’t make me a mid-level dev, but it will show initiative and that I’ve done what I can on my end.\n\nLastly, do FAANG certs help to get into FAANG? I know FAANG is not the only place to aspire to be at, but I just wanted tho throw that out there.\n\nAny advice? \n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nJust for some background--I live in the US (specifically in California) and currently have NO degree. I've been working in Aerospace/Defense world for about 11 years now, starting as an electronics technician then working my way into a hardware test engineer role, designing test fixtures and circuit boards, writing test procedures and test reports and documentation, things like that. At some point in that test engineer role, I basically got test automation software development thrust upon me since the company I'm at doesn't take software particularly seriously. But I absolutely fell in love with it, it's completely changed my life. It's like I finally realized what I want to be when I grow up, you know?\n\nSo that was about 2.5 years ago that this flame was lit, and since then I have been obsessing with software. Self-studying all the time, learning design patterns, trying new stuff. Getting pretty good at it, in my opinion, while also doing it professionally. I convinced my employer to let me move into a software role (eventually--it was a VERY slow move) and now I'm basically a software test engineer--as in, I write all the software that we use to test our hardware. I also do some stuff with CI pipelines now, though that's quite new to me AND to this organization. I may be starting a new position soon as an SDET at another Defense-like company, doing much the same thing, but much more exclusively software, and within an organization that takes software a lot more seriously.\n\nAll this to say that I have a couple of years of experience at this point, let's say. But I have no degree, and that makes getting jobs outside of the Defense world generally difficult (And I'd really like to get out of defense at some point). I've been working on my degree--slowly--at my local community college. In about a year-ish, I will be eligible to transfer somewhere else and I have some options and I want some advice from other people who've been in the software world longer than I have.\n\nThe way I see it, I have three viable options here:\n\n* **CSU Monterey Bay** offers an online computer science degree and is a more traditional route from a more reputable institution and may look better on my resume (I could also preserve my pretty kick-ass GPA, which makes me feel good as a historically piss-poor student). This is my plan currently.\n* **Southern New Hampshire University** may be a quicker means to an end here, and offers even more flexibility and is also cheaper, but potentially less reputable than a traditional institution like CSU-MB.\n* **Western Governors University** is like SNHU but on steroids. I can probably knock out 80% of the curriculum in a couple of weeks if I just go hard at it, because I really do know a lot of this stuff already. But it doesn't strike me as particularly reputable.\n\nGiven my experience, what do you think? Should I go with a WGU or SNHU type of school to check the box faster and be done with it? Or should I stay on my current path of going to the CSU, despite that it would take me something like 4 years from now (even after two years of community college) to get it? I'm 36, so not terribly old, but I also have kids and stuff, so getting done sooner would be nice so that I can have that time back sooner, but I also don't want to take shortcuts that will bite me in the ass later.\n\nSorry for the long post! I always have -vvvv flagged haha.\n\n**TLDR:** I have lots of overall technical experience and about 2.5 years of direct software experience, seeking a degree--should I go the long route with a reputable traditional institution or something fast and loose like WGU/SNHU to check the box?",
