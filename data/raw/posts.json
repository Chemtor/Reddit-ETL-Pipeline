        "content": "I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nWhy are companies acting like jerks?\n\nLast week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”\n\nSeriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?\n\nHere’s what I’ve noticed:\n\n* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.\n* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.\n* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.\n* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.\n\nDo you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?\n\nI’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\n\n\\-----\n\n\\[EDIT\\]\n\nI'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",

        "content": "I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:\n\n- Application scalability, availability, and security.\n- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.\n- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.\n- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?\n\n- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. \n\nI've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *\"Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.\"*\n\nHowever, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.\n\nData lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?\n\nEven simple stuff like \"what is a 'feature'?\" took some time to wrap my head around. *\"Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?\"*\n\nAnyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering. When they wander into your lane and start stepping on your toes, try not to get too upset.",

        "content": "hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.\n\n# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.\n\nYour work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.\n\nLLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.\n\nSo the danger isn’t the model.  \n**It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.**  \nOr their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.”  \nOr a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.\n\nYou won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.”  \n  \nThe next few years look the same:  \nIndustry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning—  \nStill out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.\n\n# How you can win this fight\n\n  \nRight now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.\n\nThe most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.\n\nIt’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago.  \nAnd now it’s your turn.\n\nYou don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.\n\n**Be the scout.**  \nThe one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. \n\nIt’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…”  \n→ Yes, and let’s do it safely.  \n→ Yes, and let’s make the most of it.  \n→ Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.\n\nBut “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” \"falling behind\" \"missed opportunity\" \"company risk\". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.\n\nSo don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.\n\nFrame it as:  \n**“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**\n\nThat’s who companies want.  \nThat’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in.  \n  \nAnd while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps you guys keep your jobs.",

Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.\n\nThat's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.\n\nNow the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.\n\nIt's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.\n\nRant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.\n\nTLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything\n",

I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came.

It’s just unfortunate timing.\n\n\nI genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.\n\nHas anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?\n\nHow did you propose it?\n\nDid you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?\n\nDo you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?\n\nIs this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?\n\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.\n\n\n",

Share your experience about the field! (please) Would love to hear how you got started (Education, early career), what worked what didn’t, where you’re at now and what someone looking to break into the field should look out for now.\n\nIk this is a lot so thank you for any time you put into responding!",

We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.\n\nAnd two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.\n\nTo make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. \n\nWe are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance.

What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.\n\nWhere I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.\n\nHowever, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view.

        "author": "Past_University_7144",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I come from a self taught background, and have been in my F200 “Data engineer” role for about a year. I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.\n\nThen through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.\n\nFast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:\n\n- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team\n- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design\n- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud\n    - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos\n- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting\n- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasks\n\nNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.\n\nI guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated. I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who has felt out of their depth in early-ish career.",

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.\n2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.\n3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.\n\nI am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3. If I choose s3, can I store the data in s3 tables instead of csv or parquet and what would be the advantage of it?",

We ingest data into the bronze layer from a wide variety of sources: APIs, Excel files, third-party applications, etc. Because of this diversity, we struggle with establishing consistent naming conventions.\n\nFor example, many datasets don’t have a straightforward business concept like `CustomerSales` or `OrderDetails`. Some are operational logs, others are reference datasets or ad hoc data pulls. This makes it hard to define a universal naming strategy.\n\nIn the gold layer, we use standard prefixes like `dim_` and `fact_` where applicable, but we often have tables that don’t neatly fall into dimension or fact categories. These are still critical to downstream consumption but are harder to categorize and name.\n\nI'm looking for:\n\n* Examples of naming conventions you’ve successfully applied in medallion architectures.\n* Resources or documentation that helped your organization design naming standards.\n* Tips for balancing flexibility and consistency when working with heterogeneous data sources.\n\nAny advice or pointers would be appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance.",

I decided to roll my own instead of using an existing one like Pandera / dataframely because I found that all the features I needed were scattered across several different existing validation libraries. At minimum, I wanted something lightweight (no Pydantic / minimal dependencies), DataFrame-agnostic, and that has a very flexible API for custom checks. I think I've achieved that, with a couple of other nice features on top (like generating a schema from existing data, filtering out failed rows, etc.), so I wanted to both share and get feedback on it!

        "content": "**TLDR:**\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).\n\nRegarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:\n\n* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.\n* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.\n* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.\n\nHugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).\n\nThis is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",

        "author": "Adrien0623",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey!\n\nI recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.\n\nIn my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.\n\nHere’s a high-level overview of the current setup:\n- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.\n- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.\n- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).\n\nWhile this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:\n- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...\n- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.\n- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.\n- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.\n\nTo address this, I’m considering the following changes:\n- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.\n- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).\n- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.\n- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.\n- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.\n\nGiven the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:\n\n1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?\n2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?\n3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?\n\nThanks a lot!",

He's quite proud of this, and wants every pipeline to use Talend.\n\nMy fellow engineers have found workarounds that minimize our exposure to it, and are basically using it for orchestration only, so the boss is happy.\n\nWe finally have a new use case, which will be, as far as I can tell, the first streaming pipeline we'll have.  I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”.  (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).\n\nOf course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing.

Now the pipeline runs itself, and sentiment and category labels get applied without any manual touchpoints.\n\nIt’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s consistent, fast, and gets us 90% of the way with near-zero overhead.\n\nIf you're working with survey data, CSAT responses, or other customer feedback streams, this might be worth exploring.

        "author": "Existing-Mousse3509",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.\n\nI'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.\n\nTo give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.\n\nNow, about the two offers:\n\nOn one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.\n\nHowever, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.\n\nThe second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of \"Data Scientist Analyst\", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.\n\nThe positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.\n\nThat’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.\n\nSo I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.\n\nAgain, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",

Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.\n\nWith just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (\"did the nightly job run?\") and execution health (\"did it finish within 4 hours?\"). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings:\n\n    from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking\n    \n    # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout...\n    dag = DAG(\"nightly_dag\", ...)\n    \n    # Enable tracking with one line!\n    enable_telomere_tracking(dag)\n\nIt integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.\n\nCheck out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.\n\nWould love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",

Is single-node processing a dealbreaker, or do most of your datasets fit on one machine anyway?\n\nHappy to answer any technical questions about the implementation.

I currently have a dictionary object that I just set some first level data in. I save this dictionary object several times as a file up in a bucket. This tracks information about the process such as\n\n\n\na. did i log into the API successfully\n\nb. how much data is available\n\nc. how much data did i download successfully\n\nd. did the api report any license changes when queried.\n\n\n\nThis is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. \n\nI then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room.  I dont save the metrics in another datasource.\n\n\n\nHowever i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs.  And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. \n\nI am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database. I have GCP so i can use pub sub, I also have access to a simple postgresdb to publish to. \n\n\n\nI do like that my stack is simple (json file to bucket) but i also know that I am not getting information that I want.\n\nThoughts on how I could improve on this? I dont mind adding something to the stack to support it. Adding something like Sentry would be my last choice at the moment as I am trying to keep the reporting stack closer in house. I am mostly looking for nice incremental improvements I can make that aren't re-stacking everything.\n\n\n\nA few other notes\n\n\n\n\\- These are cronjobs running in a linux box\n\n\\- No airflow, airbyte, dagster in the stack at the moment\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My original plan was to use an AWS Lambda and configure Event Source Mapping to automatically invoke the Lambda when new events are written to the Kinesis stream.\n\n  \nHowever, I've started wondering if this will cause performance issues as this could end up creating 120+ connections (1 invocation per shard, I have 30+ streams which each have 4 shards) to Postgres. One option could be to use RDS Proxy or PgBouncer. However, I think the \"easier\" solution could be to just write a continuously running script that creates a psycopg ConnectionPool and just run this in ECS as a service.\n\n\n\nHow would you solve this?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve \"weekly\" or \"monthly\" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it? Either way can someone give me some educational texts to support your opinions for this scenario?",

For compliance purposes (where reliability is critical), **should we persist data immediately upon ingestion, before any transformation?**\n2. In this role, do we **own the data transformation/normalization** step as well? If so, **where does that happen in the flow** — pre- or post-Pulsar?\n3. Given the use of Pulsar and focus on real-time ingestion, can we **assume this is a streaming-only system**, with no batch processing involved?\n\nWould appreciate feedback on whether the above architecture makes sense for a compliance-oriented ingestion system, and any critical considerations I may have missed.\n\nEdit: FYI I used chatgpt for formatting/coherence as my quesitons were all over the place and hence deleted my old post which has questions all over the place\n\nusing chtgpt for system design is too overwhelming as its givign so many design flows, say if i have a doubt or question and ask it then it gives back a new design flow, so its geting little exhausting. I am studying/understanding from DDIA so its been little tough to use chatpt for implemnetation or system design it due to lack of my in depth technical aptitude to sift through all the noise of answers and my questions too\n\nEdit 2: i realise recruiter telling me theres also an **aerospike cache** , which i am not sure where its used, considerign its cache, so for retrieval so it means once pulsar writes to ceph at that stage?",

I was just doing it because community contributions help us in our job promotion.\n\nEach week, I focused on one programming topic, teaching them the mental framework for solving problems and reviewing how they coded. I wasn’t expecting big changes because they were busy with coursework and exam prep and didn’t have much time to practice between sessions. To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.\n\nThis experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials. I used to think problem-solving was different that you had to grind endlessly to “figure it out.” In college, I spent countless hours on Codeforces (eventually reaching ~1900 rating and I remember feeling soo excited) and told others, including my brother to just practice more. Looking back, I wish I had given better advice not just solely focusing on practicing a lot of questions but thinking and improving the approach we take for solving any problem",

I am looking for gift ideas that will encourage and tap into that \"coding desire\" but aren't necessarily \"learning to code\" yet.  These can be games, books or anything of the sort, maybe even android apps but it would be nicer if it was something physical.  So far the only thing i've really thought of is redstone books / guides so he can do some minecraft logic.  However, I would prefer something more physical. These don't need to be directly coding related but anything that will stimulate that tinkerer, programmer, problem solving mind.  Bonus if it is coding related but I'd settle for something that scratches the programming itch. \n\nI know of scratch, but as he doesn't have a computer, I think ill save that one for a little later when he does.\n\n\nedit: Whoa, this blew up fast. Thanks everyone for your answers, there are some great suggestions.. including just getting him a computer (which I agree - but I have to convince his mum on that one first!).  I am going to go through everything suggested and see if there's some we can do together and some for him to do on his own.  Haven't decided on anything yet but there are some wonderful suggestions, might be coming back to this list for his birthday next year too!",

        "content": "Now, I may be biased because I'm all for learning to code, but holy Christ the amount of times that I have given AI a chance, it has done nothing but hurt me emotionally. I have NO IDEA how those \"no-code\" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.\n\nSo, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. \"Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each <li> element in it's own little border side-by side\". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each <li> element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. \"They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code\". I paste the supposedly \"corrected code\" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, \"Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version\", and it's not the correct version.\n\nAnother example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of \"seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?\" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating. How does someone who knows NOTHING do this and not go crazy?",

I work part-time in a supermarket. Now I'm starting self-study of JavaScript almost from scratch. I know HTML and CSS quite well, but using neural networks has dulled my brain a little. Now I almost completely abandon AI and study everything using Internet resources and open courses.\n\nI want to become a Fullstack developer. learn JavaScript (and JavaScript frameworks (React/Vue/Bootstrap)), learn how to use Node.js, Python, etc. for the Backend. I am slowly going through the Codédex courses now.\n\nI would like to ask for useful materials or tips for a beginner, how much to study per day, for example. Thanks in advance!",

How can people argue like this when there are literally thousands of conflicting opinions online about what should be **basic** OOP stuff?\n\nIn math, you have a **clear** definition. In geometry, you have **clear** definitions of theorems, axioms, and so on. But in programming? Everything feels so vague, like I’m in a philosophy or theology lecture, not studying a field where precision should be the highest priority.\n\nSeriously — **where’s the original source of truth** for this?

I recently dropped my major to a minor despite having only 2 classes left due to the sheer amount of stress it put on me and also not fitting in the box that the department wants me to fit in. At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies. For the record, I am self-taught, and of course there are gaps in my knowledge, but should anyone really care what tools I use or what I do and don't know so long as my own goals are reached? I'm more than willing to learn specific langs, frameworks, or concepts if it means I understand how to tackle a problem better, even if not in a lecture hall trying not to gouge my eyes out from sheer boredom. To be fair, I also freelance, but even still, I absolutely despite making things for the primary purpose of making a profit. Am I rambling or writing a word salad? Probably, I'm a little sleepy right now.\n\nTL;DR I like to play with my toys in my sandbox after building them, and I will never understand the culture that if you're wanting to do CS, you better want a job, because apparently people who just do it as a passion or hobby are seen as less valuable or don't have a place in the field (at least that's how I perceive it).

So I stuck with it.\n\nBut while trying to learn JS, I kept seeing videos and posts saying stuff like “do CS50 first before anything else.” So I started that, and I’m about 3 weeks in now. And honestly... it’s kinda overwhelming. There’s just so much info, and everyone seems to have a different opinion on what you should do or learn first. It’s hard to know what actually matters.\n\nMy goal is pretty simple: I just want a remote job in some decent western country. Even if it pays minimum wage (like $15k/year in the US or something), that would still be a big deal for me. I live in a third world country, and things aren’t great financially. I really want to help my family out as soon as I can.\n\nBut yeah, I just don’t know what I should be doing right now to actually get closer to that. People keep telling me I’m young and not to stress but I am stressed.

I'm in a rough financial period in my life and I'm trying to learn about this and maybe land myself another job. I dunno if age is an impediment as well.

I have no idea, I'm just a newbie. I'm a digital artist and can actually draw pretty well, this was one of the major reasons I thought of becoming a game developer because I love story telling games. I just needed a small advice if anyone can guide me what should I start with. I'd be very grateful for your advice.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. \n\nI had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.\n\nIn linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank  based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor.  I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems,  but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \\*any\\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation.\n\n  \nIn discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me.\n\n  \nIn intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.\n\nI ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.\n\nI have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school.  I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year,  but  I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS  degree curriculum  on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.\n\nWhen I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming  and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. \n\nwhen I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as \"how to draw a 2d triangle program\"  opens up a new journey  learning the  opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.\n\n\n\nI have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. \n\nI then go back to an \"intro to java/python/c# course\" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.\n\n\n\nI'm not quite sure how to move forward. \n\n  \n",

        "author": "mosahel",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello,\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, I started with programming and all this tech stuff at the very beginning of 2024. I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.\n\n\n\nThen I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.\n\n\n\nI’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.\n\n\n\nSo now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.\n\n\n\nRight now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects? I really want to make the most of this last year so I don’t end up with no job at the end, but I could use some advice—even just on what to learn, what order to tackle things, or how to structure my study time.\n\n\n\nIf anyone’s been in a similar situation, or has tips for making the most of this final stretch—whether it’s about Java, backend projects, passing those backlogs, or handling the stress of not knowing what’s next—I’d really appreciate any guidance.\n\n\n\nThank you!",

This is a pattern whereby managers, after initialization, are registered into a centralized registry as pointers to themselves. If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.\n\nHere's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location? Also, you can suggest another approach if necessary.\n\nAny help or guidance is absolutely appreciated!",

        "content": "Hey guys!\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to sincerely thank all of you for taking your time to read and respond to my post - your help truly means a lot to me!\n\nLet me start by telling a bit about myself; I'm currently a junior Data Engineer, working in a firm based in the EU - the first job I've ever had since graduating with my bachelor's last summer. I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.\n\nOver this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.\n\nThe stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.\n\nI won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.\n\nThat said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.\n\nSo now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:\n\nWhat books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a \"cracked developer\"? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.\n\nThrough this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.\n\nAs I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",

Long story short: Yes, it's super easy and great for prototyping but I simply can't stand the syntax and some other features. Probably too settled down in C-like languages.\n\nHowever, I still want to learn something new. Just for the sake of learning tbh.  \nSince I'll (probably) stick with some personal CLI tools for automation and simple tasks I don't need languages with sophisticated GUI or ML support.  \nCode should be running with little to no effort on both, Windows and Linux (MacOS is nice to have, but not a must)\n\nMy first idea was to check out Go, since it's syntax and overall featureset seems appealing to me. Same goes for Rust although the borrow-checker is... \"something different\"\n\nQuestion now:  \nDo you have any input on why to go (or not go) whith the one or other language? Might something be more suited for my purposes? Any pros and cons that I might be missing?",

I'm honestly just hoping to land any position that relates to my degree now.\n\nThe only job I’ve had is working at Burger King for a year. I know I messed up not doing internships during school. Skill-wise, I know HTML, CSS, some basic JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I’ve been working through The Odin Project but I’m only around halfway through the Foundations section. It’ll probably take me well into next year to finish the whole curriculum and ideally I’d like to be working before then.\n\nI know this kind of post probably shows up here a lot, and I’ve done a bit of googling and researching already. I guess I just want to feel more certain about what all my options really are, given my situation and in todays market (since it seems to shift around quickly).\n\nAfter researching, I'm wondering if I should just get my A+ cert and try to land a help desk job for now. I’d honestly prefer not to go that route, but if it’s the most realistic way to get a foot in the door, I’ll do it.\n\nSo basically I’m wondering:  \n– Is it still worth trying to get an internship now, even after graduating?  \n– Are there other entry-level roles besides help desk that I can realistically land with my degree + skills in 2025?  \n– Given where I’m at, what should I focus on most right now?\n\nAny advice or personal experience would be really appreciated. Just trying to get a better sense of direction. Thanks",

I'm now trying to build some more advanced tools, but I've totally hit a wall with the backend stuff and I'm hoping you guys can point me in the right direction.\n\n**Here’s my problem:** Some of the tools I've already built make API calls directly from my JavaScript. I just realized this means my API keys are completely exposed for anyone to see in the \"View Page Source,\" which is a huge security risk.\n\nI need to fix this for my existing tools and also learn how to build my new tools correctly from the start. But honestly, I have zero experience building a \"proper\" backend with something like Node.js or PHP from scratch.\n\nSo, my main question is: **For a beginner on a WordPress site, what's the simplest way to handle this securely?**\n\n1. **Can I do this inside WordPress itself?** Like, is it a good idea to use a PHP snippet in my theme's `functions.php` file to create a simple, secure endpoint? Or is there a trusted plugin for this?\n2. I've also heard about **\"serverless\"** tools like Cloudflare Workers or Netlify Functions. Are those a good fit for a beginner? Can they even work with an existing WordPress site just for these specific tasks?\n3. If you have any **links to guides or tutorials** for someone in my exact situation, that would be amazing.\n\nAny pointers you can give would be a massive help. Thanks so much for reading!",

Forced to grind Leetcode for interviews, and when I ask the senior if he had to do this he said “ nah I never had to grind Leetcode to start in 2010.\n\nThen one day I put together a soft skill resume with my content/sales/communications skills and got 5 interviews in the first week.\n\nI took one company for 4 rounds for a sales guy job 100% commission selling boats and jet ski’s.\n\nThey were genuinely excited about my tech and content and communication skills.\n\nThey offered me a job and have a proper mentorship pipeline.\n\nI was hanging out with family this last week and my little 3 year old nephew was having a blast.

On top of that, the May and June numbers were revised. 19,000 jobs were added in May and 14,000 jobs were added in June.

        "author": "FredWeitendorf",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.\n\n(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)\n\nLet me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may \"know\" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.\n\nNumber one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?\n\nNumber two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.\n\nThird most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they \"get it\"? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.\n\nNone of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.\n\nHere are a few common examples:\n\n* Sending very flowery, \"fake personalized\", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.\n* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.\n* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to \"stand out\" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.**\n* Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**\n\nWhat these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**\n\n(cont. below: what to do instead)",

Absolutely wrong mentality to have if you want to be good\n* **No passion**, people that go through bootcamps are just in it for a job. You will never find passionate software developers (the best kind) that go to these things. I know I know its not always right to require people to \"live\" their jobs. But from a quality standpoint these are the best hires. Bootcampers are never like this. They also have 0 curiosity, things like learning the codebase is implied! But because bootcampers don't care they don't do this.\n* **Spoonfeeding**, A part of being a good developer is resourcefulness, strong debugging, googling skills, and just figuring it out. If you know, you know. Especially with the massive resources online. Even before AI. A bootcamper can't do this, they need to actually be taught and spoon feed everything. Why do you think they paid for a bootcamp for info that can be found online for free! Because it takes effort to do it on your own! which they don't have.\n\nBootcampers and self-taught should not be in the same camp. I'll take self taught driven person anyday over bootcamper\n\nEdit: I actually didn’t expect this to blow up that much…crazy. I did say there are exceptions. But people still raging",

        "content": "I just spent the last few days writing a small scraper that pulled **527 active “AI Engineer / Research Engineer / ML” roles** from LinkedIn, Wellfound and a few private talent boards.\n\nAfter cleaning the dupes and mapping salaries to USD, the list only kept roles that pay **$180k – $550k total comp** (base + equity).\n\nHere are three quirks that jumped out to me (but may have been obvious to you):\n\n# 1. People who can move models from “demo” to “live” get paid the most\n\nNearly three-quarters of roles put “make it run in production” skills ahead of pure math or paper writing.\n\n* About 40% flat-out ask if you’ve ever taken a notebook proof-of-concept and turned it into a real web service that can handle thousands of user requests per second. If you can turn a cool model into a button ordinary users click you jump straight into the top salary tier.\n\n# 2. Series-B companies outbid Big Tech\n\n* The median cash + equity offers at **30-150-person, Series-A/B startups** was **$308K** – which actually turned out to be 16% higher than FAANG-level postings in the same sample.\n* My take-away? Chasing a brand name may actually cap your upside right now... the hotter money is in venture-backed startups racing to productize.\n\n# 3. They want applicants with a public footprint\n\n* More than half of the roles demanded a public Github, Kaggle gold or published paper.\n* Several even ask you to attach **“relevant Colab / HF Space links”** instead of a cover letter. Y**our next project GitHub repo or HuggingFace demo is a résumé multiplier** so make sure it's polished.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper I posted a YouTube video with the dataset linked in the description. Let me know if you want the link so I don’t break sub rules.\n\nHope these data points help you steer your learning / job search – curious what other patterns people spot",

        "content": "So I graduated from a decent Masters in CS program in the US. It used to be a top 20 school for CS when I was applying. My plan was to focus on ML exclusively. Do a thesis on it and all.\n\nHalf way through the program I lost interest in it entirely.\n\n1. ML is a lot of maths. I don't have any problem with Maths. But the maths in ML is more Statistics kind of Maths instead of Calculus or Trigonometry or co-ordinate geometry. Whenever they used to mention something related to Calculus I used to find it interesting. Whenever I used to hear the word Expected value or F-statistic or Hypothesis testing or Student's t-distribution, I was like \"God I hate this so much\".\n2. ML doesn't feel like CS. You learn some mathematical concept and based on that you set some parameters. You run some experiments and based on the outcome adjust things further. It's not deterministic. Even at the highest level ML doesn't feel like established science. I was reading two papers the other day. One was saying that 2/3rd of the weights in a transformer can be eliminated without reducing it's accuracy. And the other was showing that LLMs can be trained on a much smaller subset of the training data without compromising it's quality. Which tells me that people who originally built these things were also guessing the parameters of these models.\n3. It feels like Mathematical/Statistical modeling. Again I choose to major in CS for a reason. If I wanted to do Maths, I would have done Maths. If I wanted to do statistics, I would have done statistics. I am more interested in Algorithms. A lot of the statistics curriculum was designed during the 1920s or around that date I feel. A lot of the theory in statistics was developed to tackle problems in a manufacturing/industrial sector. Like if you advertise saying your chocolate bars have 70g of nuts, how do you statistically prove that they have 70g of nuts without opening and melting every single chocolate bar you manufacture. All of these sampling theories, Chi-Square test and stuff we created for that I feel. Almost all of the ML classes I took in college were trying to explain the concepts using statistics which killed my interest completely.\n\nSo half way through the masters, I ended up pivoting hard towards traditional CS subjects like Compilers, Operating Systems, Networks. I never did a thesis to get the degree. I just completed the 30 credits requirements and graduated.\n\nNow I have worked for 7.5 years as a back-end/systems engineer. Currently I am unemployed. I can either spend a month preparing for Backend interviews or studying ML.\n\nI tried reading through Introduction to statistical learning. But just after reading 100 pages I had to put that book aside. I don't enjoy it at all. I feel like I had to force myself to read it.\n\nBut then again I am worried if I will become unemployable if I ignore ML/AI. Does anyone else feel this way?",

After graduation, I completed an unpaid full-stack internship, which was mainly frontend development. Since then, I’ve been actively applying to jobs across different types of companies including startups, large firms, remote, on-site and hybrid roles. Despite sending out around 50-70 applications a day, I rarely hear back. Ive even been reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, and barely anything.\n\nI’ve revised my resume countless times. I’ve learned Spring Boot and am currently working on a backend project to showcase that. I also practice LeetCode daily.\n\nOut of desperation, I joined mthree in June, which is supposed to be a training-to-placement program, but they haven’t started training me yet. Feels like a waste of my time.\n\nAtp I feel like im doomed and unemployable. I've applied for QA, support, SWE, data scientist, even HR and solutions engineer. I just dont get it.\n\nFor context, I’m applying throughout the U.S. and a bit in Canada (dual citizen).\n\nWhat the hell do I even pivot into atp? Ive already tried applying for adjacent tech roles.\n\nEdit 1: Since people are commenting on the 50-70 jobs, I know 50-70 sounds intense but I apply to jobs in both Canada and USA. I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to. I also avoid easy apply and apply directly on sites.\n\nEdit 2: Here is my resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adhrvKm0kb0D_pN9hHNyOuiS30Tti5w/view?usp=sharing\n\nSome comments regarding my resume:\nMy resume is a simple Word document. I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.\n\n\nEdit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:\n1. Contribute to open-source projects\n2. Bold technologies in projects/internships\n3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)\n4. Get rid of mthree experience\n5. Reduce technical skills\n6. Remove GPA\n7. Stick to applying locally and not country-wide or cross country because they will filter you out.",

I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long.

When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks. She said at her old company they were able to build an architecture, build complete features in 1-2 hours and an entire system in less than a year for all the departments that was even HIPAA compliant.

        "content": "I'm based in the US. For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.\n\nDuring my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.\n\nLately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.\n\nHere's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I'll be looking into doing a Master's program and getting internships that way. I'll also try to monetize my app and leverage my skills to see if I can start turn it into a business.",

        "content": "one year experience. here's what's going on that I don't like:\n\n1. no breaks between sprints. No dedicated time for learning, or interval sprint for learning, yet there are hours of learning requirements that basically end up requiring overtime to get done.\n\n2. short \"technical onboarding program\" was not useful for what i'm doing on my team\n\n3. Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small  team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. \n\n4. Disorganized leadership. \"everyone in the department do the same amount of points\"(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.\n\n5. Seemingly little interest in growing me as a professional or if I even like it here. Getting 60 bucks for a bus ticket to a tech event required a whole written document. Not a lot of social opportunities and I have no time too anyways. Asked to be in specialized training programs for cloud skills and got ghosted as usual. Main focus is how I can use gen ai to do more of their work.\n\n6.Still have no goals in workday. Don't know if I'm doing well or not and am afraid to ask at this point. But bright side is I'm learning a LOT, do work with aws, and do code every day. \n\nIs this all just normal and should I kinda suck it up and stick with it or would I most likely just be better off somewhere else?\n\nI can’t switch teams or managers.\n\nEDIT:,\n\noh yeah this is important but I never wanted to do software dev my entire life. I’m getting an mba. Technical leadership is my goal at the moment. I just want a tech basis first, that’s why I have certs in ai and the cloud. I just want to be able to grow in a place that is optimal for my growth and doesn’t like, burn me out.",

I'd be pretty content to take an $80k/year TC package doing, say, PHP if it meant I didn't have to go through months of screenings and assignments competing with 200 other resumes.

I ended up working in technical presales (very strong focus on AI Platform) for 1.5 years and realized having a sales-oriented role is not really my thing, and I was risking building a career that could only lead to commercial roles, so I decided to look for software engineer openings internally and externally.\n\nFound an opening for A DIFFERENT big tech role in AI software engineering (based in EU, Eastern Europe) and decided to pursue that opportunity. I am quite happy with my choice, but most of the managers discussed this choice with are telling me that AI will come to replace many SWEs and I need to consider this, as if they're saying 'you messed up with this one'.\nI mean, they're people that do not really come from engineering and spent their life in salesy roles but these words combined with the gloomy outlook I'm seeing here online have me concerned that I should have just swallowed my dislike for business talks and stick to my already privileged position, even if it's not aligned to my liking and the career path I imagine myself pursuing.\n\nWhat do you think?

During this time I’ve been building passion projects and working on a side hustle that’s generating 20k/year (and growing) relatively passively. After 1.5 years I started applying around April/May of this year, had a few phone calls and 1 in-person, 1 final round, and 2 leetcode rounds (passed 1 for a major finance company but didn’t continue the interview process due to location of job) , but otherwise haven’t gotten any offers. I don’t mind studying leetcode (I like them but haven’t done them in a while) but I’m just not sure if my career gap will hinder my progress in breaking back in. I’m nearing 2 years and though my side hustle is gaining income, I’d still like to get into another SE gig now that I’m refreshed. I have another project I’d like to continue working on but I’m considering studying for leetcode again but not sure what my prospects would look like considering the time off I’ve had in this current market….like would it be worth it? This other side hustle I’m building has the potential to make me thousands per month somewhat passively so theres opportunity cost in pursuing another job in this climate. Anybody out there have similar experience? I don’t think it should be an issue if someone decides they want to take time off at some point but recruiters might not agree with that. I had been grinding and working while going to college for years (switched from EE to SE resulting in more time) and never had a real break in my life. ",

In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. \n\nTwo months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. \n\nVery recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. \n\nI went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally.  But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description.  It is very not palatable, I feel that I am an object, and honestly this smells of misogyny.",

My second manager made an 8 point per sprint requirement and said I didn’t have to do it, then it became a performance issue when I didn’t do it. Very confused. \n\nNow the thing is I “ask too many questions” and am not technically independent. \n\nI’m tired. \n\nI do all my stories. I never caused carry over or even a defect. I always take notes after asking a question so I never ask the same question twice. I have multiple certs. Was in a hackathon. If I’m struggling so much, how am I completing all my work before the deadline? \n\nWhen I ask a question, I always say what I tried first. I never ask without trying and saying what I tried because that’s annoying. \n\nI don’t communicate well with my tech lead because he always gets irritated very quickly towards me. Use to laugh and snap at me when I code constantly. Didn’t want to deal with that so I route questions elsewhere.\n\nHad multiple managers and they’re just like “oh if you just do x  (replace x with study outside of work, try before asking a question, say what you tried before asking a question), then they’ll be nicer to you”. Like….ok….havent I been doing that for a year straight?\n\nAnd apparently performance reviews aren’t based on actual goals, but vibes. No one has given me goals yet. I don’t pass my tech leads vibe check so all feedback from him is negative. \n\nI don’t know what they want from me. How do I even improve at this point? I study outside of work, I use ai, like…do I just suck at my job? Do I suck at this field? I don’t get it. \n\nWent to hr, they said “sounds like you’re just complaining that you have to do your work.” \n\nI can get another job, but is that best? Is this a team specific problem?  I think tech is cool, but is my brain just not cut for this?\n\n\n\n",

I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.\n\nI doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",

They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. \n\nEX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of  “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”\n\nFirst, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.\n\nI’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. \n\nI do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone. \n\nMy goal here is to simply prevent this type of rhetoric from hurting my career and reputation.\n\nI’m seeking advice on how to handle this situation. Just let it go and roll with the punches, defend myself in the moment, discuss this with someone higher up, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But only issue is that the new role is a hybrid position in the business side where the responsibilities is  70% business and 30% data related. \n\nDo y'all think shifting from technical work to a hybrid role that faces both business and IT is a good move for my career? Would I be able to come back to full IT work if I don't like business side ? ",

        "content": "I’m a senior software engineer with 4.5 years of experience (recently promoted) and have contributed a lot in my team. \n\nI constantly doubt my own understanding and technical skills, which has led to a sense of imposter syndrome. Even with several years of experience, I find myself questioning whether I truly grasp certain topics or if I’m just missing something everyone else understands. I am truly worried if somebody will ask me something during the meetings because of this. \n\nI often feel that when I discuss technical topics, the person I’m talking to tends to speak vaguely or there’s some misunderstanding at first. I also wonder if part of the issue is that my thoughts don’t always come across exactly as I intend in English, or maybe I have difficulty understanding vague explanations. Is this something others experience? How do you handle or improve communication in technical discussions to avoid misunderstandings?\n\nI also notice that other senior engineers seem skilled, they can answer almost any question on the spot whereas I’m not that type of person. When I’m asked something technical, I usually need some quiet time to fully understand the question, then I look through the relevant files and documentation before I can come up with a good answer. Sometimes I worry this means I’m not as competent, maybe I shouldn’t even be senior engineer in the first place. ",

My CC wants me to take precalc but since it’s a two part course I’d waste an entire year before I can actually start focusing on the courses I need completed before transferring. I know many people take precalc in highschool and some have taken calculus in highschool.

        "content": "Background (skip further down if you don't care):\nI'm a SENG with 3+ years working on a product that was acquired by Trimble in 2023. Nobody knew we were getting acquired besides our CEO at the time. When they told us our new salaries I'm not sure what they were based on since the lead (who actually knows what I do) wasn't involved at all. I wasn't exactly happy with my new salary compared to my coworkers so I spoke with my manager (formerly the lead) and told him I'll take on more work/responsibility so I can get a promotion down the line. So I bust my ass for 1.5 years and finally he tells me he's submitting a request that I'm promoted with the higher ups. Fast forward *8 months*, nothing. Two performance reviews during this time and my manager doesn't really know what's going on, no updates from anyone. So I'm frustrated, burnt out, unmotivated, and feel taken advantage of.\n\nMy question (skip here):\nIn my search for a new job I have an opportunity at Stripe. Stripe pays twice what I'm paid at Trimble but the internet tells me the wlb and culture there sucks, like Amazon bad. Now I'm fine with occasionally working late but it can't be every day and I can put up with annoying coworkers if I can just focus on my work and don't deal with them much. In contrast I love my coworkers where I currently am, we're all buddies. The culture at our office is amazing, but the work itself isn't always great as I'm constantly helping other teams. \n\nSo is the pay at Stripe really worth it? Do I just take the leap and see how it goes? I don't want to be miserable at my job but I also want to get paid what I know I'm worth.",

I barely know what I'm doing, and while I trust their technical skills, this seems to be their first time in a mentorship position. They've expressed to me that they're always open to advice, but I, the mentee, am not sure I trust myself to give that feedback. \n\nMy question is this: What does good mentorship look like?
