        "content": "Hey¬†r/dataengineering ¬†üëã\n\nI‚Äôve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that‚Äôs always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built¬†[ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.\n\n# So, how does it work?\n\nToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.\n\n# Connects to¬†everything\n\n* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!\n* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.\n* Any¬†API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even¬†internal APIs)\n\n# Why you'll love it\n\n* **Zero configuration:**¬†Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.\n* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g.\n   * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`\n* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!\n\n**Docs:**¬†[https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)\n\n**GitHub Repo**:¬†[https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)\n\nA ‚≠ê on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

In my previous job I worked as a researcher but I taught myself python and wrote a lot of pandas code in that role. The size of the data my old lab worked with was small but with the small amount of data I had access to I was able to build some simple python dashboards and automate processes for the lab. I also spent a lot of time in that job learning SQL on the side. The python and SQL experience from my previous job allowed me to transition to my current job. \n\nI have been in my current job for two years. I am starting to think about the next step. The problem I am having is when I search for DA jobs in my area that fit my experience, I don't see a lot of jobs that offer salaries better than what I currently make. I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. \n\nI feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part. And *unlike* my previous job where I was able to teach myself python and implement it on the job, therefore having experience I could put on job applications, there aren't the same opportunities here. Or at least, I don't see how I can make those opportunities. Our data isn't in the cloud. We have a contracting company who handles the backend of our DB. We don't have a DE like team in house. I don't have access to a lot of modern DE tools at work. I can't even install them on my work PC. \n\nA lot of the work would have to be done at home, during my free time, in the form of personal projects. I wonder, are personal projects enough nowadays?

I‚Äôm solely responsible for the BI area at my company (with basic support from an assistant), and the company has an annual revenue of around R$1.2 billion.\n\nRecently, I developed a full Power BI solution from scratch ‚Äî handling everything from data extraction and organization to visualization ‚Äî to monitor the entire operation of our distribution center, which I‚Äôll be presenting next week. I have basic knowledge of SQL and Python, and I‚Äôm particularly interested in the technical and organizational aspects of working with data.\n\nMy current role is Junior Analyst, but I‚Äôll be evaluated for a promotion to Mid-level in October. I started in this field just over two years ago, from absolute zero, as an assistant. About a year ago, the specialist in our department resigned, and even though I was still an assistant, I stepped up to take on the role. It was very challenging at first, but over time I managed to handle the workload and deliver results. According to my manager, I‚Äôm expected to be promoted to Specialist by October 2026. Even without a formal degree, I‚Äôve been able to solve the challenges that come my way.\n\nI‚Äôm 27 years old now, and I sometimes feel a bit late to start college. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like to hear your advice on the best path to land a Data Engineering position abroad.

I‚Äôve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what¬†[r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/)¬†thinks.\n\nThe basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:\n\n1. Download and extract bill data from¬†[Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/)¬†bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here\n2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS\n3. In parallel, extract member data from¬†[Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/)¬†API, concatenate, upload to GCS\n4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt\n5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.\n\nA few observations / questions that came to mind:\n\n\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\n\n\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\n\n\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I‚Äôm not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it‚Äôs applicable to my day job.\n\nThank you if you‚Äôve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I‚Äôve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).\n4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific.

        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).\n\nNow that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.\n\n### What I liked about Pulsar:\n\n* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.\n* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.\n* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).\n\n### What's painful about Pulsar:\n\n* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant\n* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication\n* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debug\n\nWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. \n\nP.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.\n",

The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).\n\n2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.\n\nI want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -\n\n1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).\n\n2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).\n\nI would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).\n\n  \nThank you for reading.",

Is a sql rdms the best opinion for data of this size on-prem?\n\n2) What learning resources to you recommend for understanding how to navigate this kind of thing? The all knowing gpt keeps suggesting designing data intensive applications and the data warehouse toolkit, both of which I have and neither really touches on this.\n\nAnyway, thanks to any on-prem homies who know the struggle and have advice.",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\nLike many of you, I've spent a good chunk of my career being the go-to person for ad-hoc data requests. The constant context-switching to answer simple questions for marketing, sales, or product folks was a huge drain on my productivity.\n\nSo, I started working on a side project to see if I could build a better way. The result is something I'm calling DBdash.\n\nThe idea is simple: it‚Äôs a tool that lets you (or your less-technical stakeholders) ask questions in plain English, and it returns a verified answer, a chart, and just as importantly, the exact SQL query it ran.\n\nMy biggest priority was building something that engineers could actually trust. There are no black boxes here. You can audit the SQL for every single query to confirm the logic. The goal isn't to replace analysts or engineers, but to handle that first layer of simple, repetitive questions and free us up for more complex work.\n\nIt connects directly to your database (Postgres and MySQL supported for now) and is designed to be set up in a few minutes. Your data stays in your warehouse.\n\nI'm getting close to a wider launch and would love to get some honest, direct feedback from the pros in this community.\n\n\\*   Does this seem like a tool that would actually solve a problem for you?  \n\\*   What are the immediate red flags or potential security concerns that come to mind?  \n\\*   What features would be an absolute must-have for you to consider trying it?\n\nYou can check out the landing page here: [https://dbdash.app](https://dbdash.app)\n\nIt's still in early access, but I'm really keen to hear what this community thinks. I'm ready for the roast!\n\nThanks for your time.",

Features like materialized view or aggregating mergetrees seems also super interesting to us.\n\nWe have made the decision to incluse CH into our infrastructure, knowing that it's gonna be a key part for BI mostly (metrics coming from sensors mostly, with quite a lot of functional logic with time windows or contexts and so on).\n\nThe question is: how do we host this?\nThere isnt a single chance I can convince my boss to use a managed service, so we will use resources from a cloud provider.\n\nWhat are you experiences with self-hosted CH? Would you recommend a replicated infrastructure with multiple containers based on docker-compose ? Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?\nAlso, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it!\n\n[Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/day\n\nThank you very much!",

We're talking days, not hours, for the sync to complete, which leaves our downstream dashboards and reports stale.\n\n**Our Current Setup:**\n\n* **Source:** HubSpot\n* **Destination:** Snowflake\n* **Integration Tool:** Airbyte\n* **Sync Mode:** Incremental Append + Deduplication\n* **Suspected Bottleneck:** We're almost certain this is due to the HubSpot API rate limits.\n\n**My Questions for You:**\n\n1. What tools or architectures are you using for this pipeline (Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch, custom scripts, etc.)?\n2. How do you manage HubSpot schema changes without triggering a full, multi-day table resync?\n3. Are there any known workarounds for HubSpot's API limits, like using webhooks for certain events or exporting files to S3 first?\n4. Is there a better sync strategy we should consider?\n\nI'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks in advance for your input!",

Kafka is used as the message queue, and MinIO is used to replicate an S3 bucket.\n\nIf you're the type of person that likes digging around in code, you can check the project out [here](https://github.com/bryanbritten/hl7-integration).\n\nIf you're the type of person that would rather watch a video overview, you can check that out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3de54014865b4cb7aa59b87ec940626d?sid=271f23fd-7ade-4f82-864f-e2a288a96a36).\n\nI'd love to get feedback on what I'm getting right and what I could include to better represent my capacity for working as a Data Integration Engineer in healthcare. I am already planning to extend the segments and message types that are generated, and will be adding a terminology server (another Docker service) to facilitate working with LOINC, SNOMED, and IDC-10 values.\n\nThanks in advance for checking my project out!",

On the upside, the startup role looks exciting since I‚Äôd have the chance to build the data platform from the ground up, get hands-on with AI agents development, and manage customer facing initiatives.\n\nThe move would also mean relocating from the East Coast to the West Coast and buying a car, longer hours and more stress.\n\nWould you stick with the big firm or take the leap for the startup?",

        "content": "Two years ago I had an internship where I had to create a plugin for an existing WordPress website using PHP. I was the only programmer on the team. My supervisor only knew about WordPress styling and the others were working in a completely different sector. I had applied too late for internships and didn‚Äôt want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.\n\nThe supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.\n\nNow I‚Äôm studying a higher level degree in the same field. It‚Äôs something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.\n\nThere is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.\n\nAI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.\n\nLong story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it‚Äôs been doing good. It‚Äôs like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself. That's also why I chose this path.\n",

I‚Äôd love to get advice from this community.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found so far (please correct me if I‚Äôm missing something):\n\nPostman ‚Üí Probably the most popular. Great GUI, lots of tutorials.\n\nHoppscotch ‚Üí A lightweight, open source alternative to Postman. Runs in the browser or self-hosted.\n\nBruno ‚Üí Stores collections as plain text, easy to version control (great for teams).\n\nHurl ‚Üí CLI-based, tests APIs using simple text files. Super clean for automation.\n\nYaak ‚Üí Made by the original Insomnia founder. Sleek UI.\n\nSoapUI ‚Üí Bit older but strong if you need SOAP and more complex protocols.\n\nApidog ‚Üí Similar to Postman, but I noticed it has a neat offline mode and works well for designing + mocking APIs.\n\nThunder Client (VS Code extension) ‚Üí Really handy if you don‚Äôt want to leave your editor.\n\n\nFor someone still learning programming, what would you recommend focusing on first?\nShould I start with a GUI tool like Postman/Bruno/Hoppscotch, or dive straight into CLI stuff like Curl/Hurl to build stronger fundamentals?\n\nWould love to hear what worked for you all when you were learning API testing.

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.\n\n\n\nHere's what I've started doing that seems to help:\n\nTaking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. \n\nWrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.\n\nBetter posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.\n\nSplit keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well. \n\nProper mouse positioning: Moved my mouse closer and have been on a lookout for a vertical mouse. I've been checking out the Anker wireless vertical ergonomic mouse as well as the Logitech MX vertical, which one is better? Any other ergonomic mouse that I should check out?\n\nAnyone else dealing with this early in their programming journey? What's worked for you?

The issue is‚Ä¶ programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.\n\nMy very first programming course happened only after I got  into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck ‚Äî partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: ‚ÄúI failed this once, I‚Äôll fail it again.‚Äù Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.\n\nI actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.\n\nI‚Äôve seen the advice ‚Äúpick a project idea and use it to learn,‚Äù but I‚Äôve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it‚Äôs useless to jump into projects if you‚Äôre still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.\n\nSo I‚Äôm not really looking for project ideas right now ‚Äî more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I‚Äôm really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo much of a bio/med‚Äù to ever be good at programming.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever been stuck in a similar way, I‚Äôd also love to hear your stories ‚Äî what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.\n\nIt feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors ‚Äî after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I‚Äôm just stuck and don‚Äôt want to waste another year circling the same fear.",

I've made a few games using engines like GDevelop and Construct 2, but now... I want to learn Java. \n\nI read somewhere that \"It's best advised to start with something called - Object Oriented Programming.\" I also heard that University of Helsinki is/was apparently the best place to start with OOP. I went to their website, and found this link:  [https://java-programming.mooc.fi/](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) \n\nIs it outdated? Is this the best starting point?\n\nMy sole purpose of wanting to learn Java is to eventually make an RPG game engine for mobile and PC games. It's a BIG dream, I know.. but at least I have a very clear goal in mind. I don't know if that makes things better or worse. \n\nAs a self-taught 2d animator, I'm no stranger to self inflicted pain... and I hope to achieve my goal, after however long it takes. Even if it eventually means teaming-up with other more skilled devs. \n\nFor now, I need an advice on the best starting place to learn/approach Java.",

Then I went into getting my backend developer certificate and am struggling really bad with learning backend coding with express and more advanced Javascript... I've been wondering what all exactly would go into being a front-end developer bc I already completed my CSS certificate and most of Javascript and HTML. I'm not very good at styling things myself, but feel with a little more practice I could properly write the code according to what an employer would specifically want a webpage or things to look like. For front-end development do employers give you guidelines on what exactly they want things to look like or do I have to design things myself? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?\n\nThis is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner‚Äôs first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it‚Äôs simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.\n\nThere are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, there‚Äôs the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they‚Äôll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?\n\nThe answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.\n\nSo, the debate is not just ‚ÄúWhich language is best?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúWhat matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?‚Äù",

I‚Äôm using MySQL for this because I want to get better with it for interviews and projects. I know i can use other tools to clean the messy data but i want to do it using sql to get some hands on experience wigh it\n\nThe trouble is, I have CSV files that contain a bunch of empty strings. MySQL won‚Äôt let me import those directly when my columns are typed as INT, DATE, etc. So I thought of two ways but both feel kinda inefficient:\n\n1. Create the table with all columns as `VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, import the raw data, then *later* clean the data by replacing empty strings with NULL or proper values, and finally convert each column to the right data type.\n\n2. Same as above but instead of replacing empty strings with proper values right away, I replace all empty strings with NULLs first, then work on cleaning/converting.\n\nI‚Äôm stuck because both approaches feel like extra work ‚Äî importing everything as text then cleaning and converting feels like a hassle, especially since I‚Äôm still learning.\n\nI‚Äôm also wondering if maybe I should just switch to MSSQL since I heard it‚Äôs more flexible with empty strings on import, but I really want to stick with MySQL for now.\n\nSo, any tips or best practices for importing messy CSV data with empty fields into MySQL? Am I missing a better way? How do you pros handle these kinds of data issues in real-world projects? Also, if you were me, would you stick to MySQL or try MSSQL instead?",

We use vanilla JavaScript and PHP, since it‚Äôs WordPress, and that‚Äôs pretty much what I know so far. During this time, I‚Äôve worked on implementing CRUD functionality, building backend logic with data validation, making asynchronous requests with AJAX, integrating third-party APIs, handling structured data formats like XML and JSON, and developing and styling frontend features with JavaScript and CSS.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a year, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve made much progress. Even though I‚Äôve done these things, I still feel like I‚Äôm not really learning or growing. I also don‚Äôt have a portfolio yet because I honestly don‚Äôt know what to build. Would it be okay if I just create landing pages and web apps for my portfolio? I feel like no one would hire me as I am now since I‚Äôm still new, but I want to start building something to show.\n\nAny advice or ideas would really help. Also, after getting better with vanilla JavaScript and PHP, what languages or tools should I learn next if I want to move forward as a full stack developer? There are so many options and I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here.\n",

        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.\n\nThis is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.\n\nThere's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.\n\nI think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nSo many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.\n\nI can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I‚Äôd also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I‚Äôd ever stand out in any way.\n\nWhat surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.\n\nThat shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.\n\nI know it‚Äôs tough because ‚Äújust do more tickets‚Äù feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.\n\nCurious if anyone else has felt the same? Do you feel like you‚Äôre in the grind stage, or have you found other ways to break out of burnout?",

Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.\n\nThis really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there‚Äôs a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it‚Äôs unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.\n\nIf you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.\n\n**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\n\n\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\n\n\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\n\n\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\n\n\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\n\n\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\n\n\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\n\n\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between ¬£30k to ¬£40k.\n\n\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\n\n\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company‚Äôs internal recruitment information on the internet.\n\n\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\n\n\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

It seems like an intentional barrier created to keep experienced developers out who have worked on various programming languages over the decades.\n\nSo if I code accurately in Java for example the React interviewer expects me to do code as precisely or vice a versa. Obviously you can‚Äôt be expert on both even though resume clearly shows I‚Äôve delivered and can explain. Interview has become a dice game. I also find that one expert keeps silence over other language expert as they don‚Äôt know anything about it and want to maintain their skill set tied to only one coding language. Age barrier is apparent.",

Think about two different recruiting workflows:\n\n1. AI screening -> manual screening -> applicant completes the OA -> interview process...\n2. Applicant completes the OA -> AI screening -> manual screening -> interview process...\n\nThe second approach doesn't make any sense, unless the screening algorithm gives the OA result high weight/priority (even so you can still apply AI screening without OA before the OA).

I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.\n\nMaybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.\n\nSo I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you?

Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.\n\nAnd right now I have heightened imposter syndrome.

He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).\n\nSo I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...\n\nI am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.\n\nLately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.\n\nI was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern). It looked like should not work. I wanted to discuss with another colleague... After 10min of the call, I spent another hour to debug the code and check how it functions via tests. It worked well. Messaged the MID dev and I felt I wasted his time.\n\nThese questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...\n\nI just feel I do not get enough work done, I feel somewhat unmotivated and I feel I waste people's time...

I feel like if I lowered my salary expectations I‚Äôd probably land something sooner, but I‚Äôd be taking a pay cut.\n\nMeanwhile, my company is shaky financially ‚Äî they‚Äôve already had a few rounds of layoffs and I‚Äôd guess they‚Äôve got maybe a year or two of runway left. Part of me wonders if I should just coast, stop caring so much, and wait to be laid off while applying to better jobs. The other part of me feels like I should just cut my losses now and more aggressively seek a lower-paying but more sustainable role.\n\nWhat would you do?",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm feeling stuck in my career and don't know what my next move is. I have been working in tech support since 2019, primary in the web-hosting space. While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.\n\nI've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. \n\nEssentially, I'm stuck in support hell.\n\nI really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start. I'm left with the question of \"do I want to leave the tech world or do I just hate working in support?\"\n\nHas anyone else broken out of support hell into a more technical, non customer facing role? What did it take? Did it reshape your opinion of your work? Do you find it more fulfilling? ",

        "content": "\\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\\]\n\nHi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.\n\nI'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.\n\nAt work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.\n\nWhile management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the \"senior founder dev\" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.\n\nIt has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( \n\nI've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to \"catch up\" and but I never quite get there...\n\nAnd outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?\n\nWhat I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.\n\n*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.*\n\n*PS. English is my secondary language and I closed my Grammarly account so apologize if the text is messy.*\n\n",

The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).\n\nI've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.\n\n* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).\n* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).\n* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).\n* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).\n* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.\n* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.\n\nSo all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**\n\nA lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.\n\nThe project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.\n\nThe problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's \"in Japanese\" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.\n\nI am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about. I want a job, and I want to optimize my personal projects to help me get that job as much as I can. So I'd love some input on whether projects like the one I linked are good fits for that or if I need to shift gears and go another route. I'm totally happy either way, I just really want to know so I don't waste months of my time.",

Sometimes deeming those non-urgent tasks as urgent.\n\n3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.\n\n4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.\n\n5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.\n\n6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.\n\n6. Makes decisions very fast without much information at all. This includes creating new meetings, cancelling meetings, creating new outings, letting people off early then asking them to stay for an adhoc meeting, etc.\n\n7.

Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. \n\nI know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, \"Do you know Spring Boot?  Do you know Angular?\"  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  \n\nSo, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. \n\nA bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.\n\nI don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. \n\nSo, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.  \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?

Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.\n\nThe projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any \"real\" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it \"right\" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)\n\nI just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).\n\nI don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",

        "content": "1.5 months ago a recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin, and I took a while to reply but ended up having a discovery call with him where he told me about the job, and I was interested so I asked a lot of questions. He then said he'll send an assessment for me to complete and I said I'll do it (this is for a tech job, similar to my current one but it seemed to be a tad better). I had that random burst of inspiration so at the time I was going to do it. However I got busy, work had a lot of tasks for me to do, and I couldn't find the time. He even followed up after the assessment expired 2 weeks later and said to let him know if I'd like it renewed, or no longer interested.\n\nI'm very bad with replying to messages, because I get a lot, and I usually prioritize ones from my immediate circle. I'm also pretty disorganized so I was going to respond, but the days passed by am I didn't. Now it's been 2 weeks and I basically ghosted him, not telling him I'm not interested (I wanted to interview anyway just to see if I could have the option, but I probably wouldn't take it because I got good feedback at work so my confidence in my company is renewed for now).\n\nI feel really bad! Should I message him now, saying I'm so sorry for ghosting and I meant to reply but lost track of time?? I also don't want to be blacklisted from that company and would like the option to resume the recruitment process for this role if things at my job change. ",

I don‚Äôt find software particularly fun, and I don‚Äôt see myself doing this long term. It was the only job I could get with my skill set at that point of time. I‚Äôve always found ML to be really cool and I‚Äôve done a research internship in this field. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to get any ML engineer or data scientist jobs right out of undergrad (they wouldn‚Äôt even interview me). I suspect the lack of a graduate degree to be the reason, and many job postings I find interesting ask for or prefer one. \n\nHow can I pivot to a more quantitative role from SWE. If I continue working as a SWE I‚Äôm afraid I will be stuck. I‚Äôve been contemplating going back for a Masters but a few things irk me:\n\n1. I don‚Äôt want to pay 5 figures for a masters, and funded masters often ask for TA and research experience, which I lack. I did go to a competitive school so maybe my GPA can be contextualized ‚Äî hard to say though. I am in state for Texas, and I could potentially pay for TAMU or UT for a semester and gamble on getting a TA position.\n2. Opportunity cost. Say I do get a masters, there‚Äôs no guarantee I will get a job in ML, and I would end up working as a SWE anyway. Minus 2 years of comp\n3. There‚Äôs millions of MS CS grads in the market and I would be competing with them for jobs in an already shaky market.\n\nAnyone who‚Äôs been through this song and dance want to chime in? In my company moving internally to a research role is very rare so that‚Äôs not possible. I really enjoyed my ML research and coursework, and I am open to working for a university lab as a researcher, as a pathway for a PhD. The lab I interned at has changed direction and focuses more on computational biology, the ML project was a one off I guess. So there‚Äôs no going back to that. My long term goal is doing applied ML at a company or in academia. This is highly coveted and competitive, so any input would be appreciated.",

I naturally have a learning curve in CS so it takes me longer than usual to get in to the groove and understand.

I haven't done any preparation for that (I'm an NG, and the role required some experience; I applied anyway, didn't even tailor my resume to match the JD). If they do, I'm thinking maybe I should reschedule the interview and give myself a little bit of time to at least do some practice so I don't bomb it and embarrass myself. \n\n",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\nI have 10 years of experience as an SWE (mostly .NET), and I've been through an anxiety train with some personal things and impostor syndrome.\nI was laid off in July and I currently have 2 offers in hand, and another 2 final interviews... so in a sense, im probably not in a that bad situation, 4 chances in 1 month is probably great.\n\nReminder that I am based in Portugal so the salaries will just be lower. Regardless of that I feel like its a good idea to start working as soon as possible to not fill a gap.\n\nOffer 1: 70k in a USA International consulting agreement (4k net for 3 months, drops to 3k net in contract). This would be a B2B contract until the office gets setup here, which in their perspective takes 3 months. This would become a hybrid role 1x per week, but its 300km away. Besides, since its a B2B with absolutely no benefits (no insurance, no PTO, no nothing, just a monthly retainer), I would have to open tax activity and terminate my unemployment salary which I have for another 1.5 years (worth 1.3k month) and I will not get it back if they fire me (which they can for whatever reason since this is California based law with 0 rights for me). I feel this is extremely risky as they can just replace me with an offshore for cheap anytime they want, and the glassdoor reviews seem spammed with fake 5 stars, with 1 star comments actually mentioning the CEOs names.\n\nOffer 2: My ex ex company offered 2k net and its a 2x per week hybrid role, 70km away, which is better. They want me to be a tech lead and grab every backoffice and migrate to a modular monolith, with .NET and React. It is a long term contract, I have been in this company for 6 years and I needed 0 technical interviews to get an offer, just a call to my boss and he straight away gave me a contract and all his plans.\n\nI am thinking of accepting offer 2, even though its lower. My plan is to just have a safety zone and invest my free time: keep doing interviews and grind system design (which I now will in this job) and learn kubernetes.\n\nAm I doing the correct thing to play safe and secure, and jump back to something better if it shows up?",

Lately he's been hating his job since his old friend/boss retired and they sold the company to PE. He wants out but has only had 3 jobs in his life all in tech, telecom or IT. H is most recent role was was an Exec at a regional Airline company for 10 years but doesn't know if this will help. He's okay with a title and pay cut, i guess his new boss is really that bad. Has anyone looked for new jobs in their 50s for SWE? ",
