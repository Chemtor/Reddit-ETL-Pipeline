I chose this career path because I really like the puzzle solving element of coding, and being stinking good at data quality analysis. This is the aspect of my job that puts me into a flow state. I also have never been strong with expressing myself with words - this is something I struggle with professionally and personally. It just takes me a long time to fully articulate myself.\n\nMy company is SUPER welcoming and open of using AI. I have been willing to use AI and have been finding use cases to use AI more deeply. It's just that...using AI changes the job from coding to automating, and I don't enjoy being an \"automater\" if that makes sense. I don't enjoy writing prompts for AI to then do the stuff that I really like. I'm open to future technological advancements and learning new things - like I don't want to stay comfortable, and I've been making effort. I'm just feeling like even if I get really good at this, I wouldn't like it much...and not sure what this means for my employment in general.  \n  \nIs anyone else struggling with this? I'm not sure what to do about it, and really don't feel comfortable talking to my peers about this. Surely I can't be the only one?\n\nGoing to keep trying in the meantime...",

        "content": "\nHey folks,\n\nSo here's the situation: one of our stakeholders got hyped up after reading some LinkedIn post claiming you can \"magically\" connect your data warehouse to ChatGPT and it’ll just answer business questions, write perfect SQL, and basically replace your analytics team overnight. No demo, just bold claims in a post.\n\nWe tried to set realistic expectations and even did a demo to show how it actually works. Unsurprisingly, when you connect GenAI to tables without any context, metadata, or table descriptions, it spits out bad SQL, hallucinates, and confidently shows completely wrong data.\n\nAnd of course... drum roll... it’s our fault. Because apparently we “can’t do it like that guy on LinkedIn.”\n\nI’m not saying this stuff isn’t possible—it is—but it’s a project. There’s no magic switch. If you want good results, you need to describe your data, inject context, define business logic, set boundaries… not just connect and hope for miracles.\n\nHow do you deal with this kind of crap? When influencers—who clearly don’t understand the tech deeply—start shaping stakeholder expectations more than the actual engineers and data people who’ve been doing this for years?\n\nMaybe I’m just pissed, but this hype wave is exhausting. It's making everything harder for those of us trying to do things right.",

I acknowledge that the concepts have some overlap,  the idea of correctness, but to me they are distinct in practice. \n\nUnit testing is about making sure that some dependency change or code refactor doesn’t result in bad code that gives wrong results. Integration and e2e testing are about the whole integrated pipeline performing as expected. All of those could, in theory, be written as pytest tests (maybe). It’s a “build time” construct, ie *before* your code is released. \n\nData quality checks are about checking the integrity of production data as it’s already flowing, each time it flows. It’s a “runtime” construct, ie *after* your code is released. \n\nI’m open to changing my mind on this, but I need to  be persuaded. \n\n",

All you need is one binary. After ingesting data via [sling](https://docs.slingdata.io), I found querying to be quite responsive (due to the SQL catalog backend). with Iceberg, querying can be quite sluggish, and you can't even query with SQL without some heavy engine like spark or trino.\n\nOf course, Iceberg has the advantage of being more established in the industry, with a longer track record, but I'm rooting for ducklake.

One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?\n2. How *straightforward* it is to use technologies like Iceberg for managing non-tabular binary files like pictures, videos, PDFs etc? Is it even possible? If yes, is this a common use case?\n3. Will these technologies become the *de facto* standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?",

It's built to scale out as a production-grade, distributed query engine capable of providing low latency, high concurrency analytics, ELT at scale, and particularly powerful analytics on Iceberg, but it's also capable of running on small datasets on a single laptop for those looking to give it a lightweight try.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Core and its launch, Firebolt's CTO Mosha Pasumansky and VP of Engineering Benjamin Wagner wrote [a blog explaining more about what it is, why we built it, and what you can do with it.](https://www.firebolt.io/blog/introducing-firebolt-core) It also touches on the topic of open source - which Core isn't.\n\nOne extra goodie is that thanks to all the work that's gone into Firebolt and the fact that we included all of the same performance improvements in Core, it's immediately debuting at the top spot on the [Clickbench benchmark.](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) Of course, we're aware that performance isn't everything, but Firebolt is built from the ground up to be as performant as possible, and it's meant to power analytical and application workloads where minimizing query latency is critical. When that's the space you're in, performance matters a lot... and so you can probably see why we're excited.\n\nStrongly recommend giving it a try yourself, and let us know what you think!",

Piggy-backing off of this whole \"DE's don't test\" discussion, I'm curious what test are most common for your typical data pipeline?\n\nPersonally, I'm thinking of typical \"lift and shift\" testing like row counts, aggregate checks, and a few others. But in a more complicated data pipeline where you might be appending using logs or managing downstream actions, how do you test to ensure durability?",

In three weeks, I’m starting a new job as a Senior Data Engineer at a new company.  \nA big part of my responsibilities will involve writing jobs in Databricks and managing infrastructure/deployments using Terraform.  \nUnfortunately, I don’t have hands-on experience with Databricks yet – although a few years ago I worked very intensively with Apache Spark for about a year, so I assume it won’t be too hard for me to get up to speed with Databricks (especially since the requirement was rated at around 2.5/5). Still, I’d really like to start the job being reasonably prepared, knowing the basics of how things work, and become independent in the project as quickly as possible.\n\nI’ve been thinking about what the most important elements of Databricks I should focus on learning first would be. Could you give me some advice on that?\n\nSecondly – I don’t know Terraform, and I’ll mostly be using it here for managing Databricks: setting up job deployments (to the right cluster, with the right permissions, etc.). Is this something difficult, or is it realistic to get a good understanding of Terraform and Databricks-related components in a few days?  \n(For context, I know AWS very well, and that’s the cloud provider our Databricks is running on.)  \nCould you also give me some advice or recommend good resources to get started with that?\n\nBest,  \nMike",

It doesnt matter if you know how to write a loop in some language or how to define a class or anything similar, you just need to be able to realize when you need to iterate over something or express a concept with specific attributes. You can always just reference the syntax later.\n\nI have taken soo many lessons on these things and they all make sense on that day but days later I forget what each of them mean.

        "content": "I moved from a startup into a corporate job ( digital banking ) a few months ago. I’m from Malaysia , for context. I’m still under probation. And honestly, I don’t know anymore if I’m underperforming, or if I’m just stuck in a dysfunctional culture that burns people out.\n\nIn my previous role, I worked as a backend engineer. I had autonomy. Things moved fast. Feedback was immediate. Now, I’m in an environment where expectations are vague, processes are messy, and communication is passive-aggressive.\n\nOne example: we have a support schedule to help vendors load data into internal systems. They can’t do it directly, so someone from our side has to run everything manually. It’s basic, repetitive work , I once suggested scripting it to make the process cleaner. That suggestion was ignored. So we keep doing it the hard way.\n\nRecently I got pinged after working hours to join a “5-minute call to load something” , something that would run for 10 hours. There was no advance notice, just the assumption I’d be available. I was already off shift, but even then, the next day came with a passive-aggressive remark: “Didn’t expect this from you.” This wasn’t the first time either.\n\nThen there’s the feedback I’ve been given. My boss told me twice , that I lack “initiative.” The most recent example was over documentation. I was asked to update some system design docs. I did. I even left a comment inside tagging him, asking for input , which should’ve triggered an email notification. But I didn’t follow up in Teams because I got pulled into other work. I was literally about to update him the next morning when he messaged me and immediately launched into a rant about me needing to be more proactive and take ownership. Even though the work had been done. However, sometime he would dished out praise but rarely. \n\nMeanwhile, I’m putting in 10–15 hour days. I’m exhausted. I forget things. I don’t have any more bandwidth. I’m not even doing meaningful engineering work , just reacting to whatever lands in my inbox or chat window. No ownership, no growth. Just people assuming I’ll pick up anything and everything.\n\nThis is starting to affect my personal life. I carry the resentment home. I’m always tired. I’m checked out even when I’m not working. I literally can’t take a shit without being pulled into a meeting.\n\nSo now I’m asking: is this a sign I’m not fit for this kind of culture? Am I truly missing something basic? Or is this what happens when you take someone from a fast, transparent, builder-type environment and drop them into a place where nobody wants to own problems , they just want someone to quietly clean up the mess?\n\nIf you’ve been through this, I’d appreciate perspective.",

That seems...incredibly expensive.\n\nOr would they pre-aggregate at a higher granularity, potentially sacrificing some dimensions in the progress, to accelerate their dashboards?\n\nThis way you could just group by hour + ad_id + dim1 + dim2 ... and then run sum(clicks) / sum(impressions) to get a CTR estimate.

I've learned a ton about integrating LLMs with data platforms.\n\nI'd be incredibly grateful if you seasoned data engineers could check it out.

        "author": "Asleep-Rise-473",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Full disclosure:** I'm part of the team at Databend, and we just published a deep-dive article on User-Defined Functions (UDFs). I’m sharing this here because it tackles a question we see all the time: when and how to move beyond standard SQL for complex logic in a data pipeline. I've made sure to summarize the key takeaways in this post to respect the community's rules on self-promotion.\n\nWe've all been there: your SQL query is becoming a monster of nested `CASE` statements and gnarly regex, and you start wondering if there's a better way. Our goal was to create a practical guide for choosing the right tool for the job.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the approaches we cover:\n\n* **Lambda (SQL) UDFs:** The simplest approach. The guide's advice is clear: **if you can do it in SQL, do it in SQL**. It's the easiest to maintain and debug. We cover using them for simple data cleaning and standardizing business rules.\n* **Python & JavaScript UDFs:** These are the workhorses for most custom logic. The post shows examples for things like:\n   * Using a Python UDF to validate and standardize shipping addresses.\n   * Using a JavaScript UDF to process messy JSON event logs by redacting PII and enriching the data.\n* **WASM (WebAssembly) UDFs:** This is for when you are truly performance-obsessed. If you're doing heavy computation (think feature engineering, complex financial modeling), you can get near-native speed. We show a full example of writing a function in Rust, compiling it to WASM, and running it inside the database.\n* **External UDF Servers:** For when you need to integrate your data warehouse with an existing microservice you already trust (like a fraud detection or matchmaking engine). This lets you keep your business logic decoupled but still query it from SQL.\n\nThe article ends with a \"no-BS\" best practices section and some basic performance benchmarks comparing the different UDF types. The core message is to start simple and only escalate in complexity when the use case demands it.\n\n**You can read the full deep-dive here:** [https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend\\_UDF/](https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend_UDF/)\n\nI'd love to hear how you all handle this. What's your team's go-to solution when SQL just isn't enough for the task at hand?",

        "content": "Hey everyone—I could really use some advice.\n\nI’m currently a senior data analyst working in healthcare fraud analytics and model development at a large government contracting firm. Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.\n\nRecently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.\n\nI already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.\n\nThe catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.\nI expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.\n\n⸻\n\nMy question for you all:\n1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?\n2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?\n3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)\n4. If I pass this up, how hard would it be to break into DE externally without prior experience or the DE title?\n\nAny perspective—especially from folks who’ve made the jump or hired junior/mid DEs—would really help.

        "content": "Hopefully this is the correct subreddit. Not sure where else to ask. \n\nPremise: So our application has a requirement from the C-suite executives to be active-active. The goal for this discussion is to understand whether Mongo or Postgres makes the most sense to achieve that. \n\nBackground: It is a containerized microservices application in EKS. Currently uses Oracle, which we’ve been asked to stop using due to license costs. Currently it’s single region but the requirement is to be multi region (US east and west) and support multi master DB.\n\nDetails: Without revealing too much sensitive info, the application is essentially an order management system. Customer makes a purchase, we store the transaction information, which is also accessible to the customer if they wish to check it later. \n\nUser base is 15 million registered users. DB currently had ~87TB worth of data. \n\nThe schema looks like this. It’s very relational. It starts with the Order table which stores the transaction information (customer id, order id, date, payment info, etc). An Order can have one or many Items. Each Item has a Destination Address. Each Item also has a few more one-one and one-many relationships. \n\nMy 2-cents are that switching to Postgres would be easier on the dev side (Oracle to PG isn’t too bad) but would require more effort on that DB side setting up pgactive, Citus, etc. And on the other hand switching to Mongo would be a pain on the dev side but easier on the DB side since the shading and replication feature pretty much come out the box. \n\nI’m not an experienced architect so any help, advice, guidance here would be very much appreciated. \n\n\n",

I began my career in 2017 as a junior data engineer and worked in India for 5 years. During that time, I gained solid experience with technologies such as Spark, Airflow, AWS, CI/CD, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SQL, Python, Scala, and a bit of GCP. These form the core of my technical background.\n\nAfter working with two companies in India, I moved to the UK in mid-2022 to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science. It was a one-year program, and I graduated in 2023 with distinction. Right after graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in the UK until February 2025. Around that time, I moved to Ireland on a joint visa, and I'm currently settled here.\n\nSince March 2025, I've been actively looking for opportunities in data engineering or software development. I’ve been fortunate to receive interviews from some great companies. I’ll admit, I wasn’t fully prepared for the first two or three, but since then, I’ve put in a lot of focused effort. I'm now quite confident in SQL, Python, and problem-solving.\n\nHowever, it’s now June, and I still haven’t landed a role. I’ve reached the final rounds in 3 or 4 interviews, but unfortunately, the outcomes have been negative. This has been difficult emotionally, and I'm growing concerned about the employment gap it’s creating in my career.\n\nI can feel the competition is intense, especially in the data engineering field. Some people are even surprised that I haven’t secured a role yet, given my 5+ years of experience and a master’s degree. I understand their perspective, but I’m truly doing everything I can.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, guidance, or even just words of encouragement, I would deeply appreciate it. If you were in my position, what would you do? I’m starting to feel like my career is slipping away, and any support would mean a lot to me right now.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

No git, no code reviews, no documentation, no ownership, everyone is crammed which leads to low collaboration unless explicitly asked for. \n\nThe job however, have many upsides too.

It's been a massive improvement over our previous Databricks setup — we can transact millions of rows in seconds with much more control.\n\nWhat I want now is user authentication and access control:\n\n* Specifically, I want certain users to have read-only access.\n* They should still be able to submit Spark SQL queries, but no write operations (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).\n\nWhen using Databricks, this was trivial to manage via Unity Catalog and OAuth — I could restrict service principals to only have SELECT access. But I'm now outside the Databricks ecosystem using vanilla Spark 4.0 and Spark Connect, which I want to add, has been orders of magnitude more performant and easier to operate, and I’m struggling to find an equivalent.\n\nIs there any way to restrict Spark SQL commands to only allow reads per session/user? Or disallow any write operations at the SQL level for specific users or apps (e.g., via Spark configs or custom extensions)?\n\nEven if there's a way to disable all write operations globally for a given Spark Connect session or app, I could probably work around that for my use case by leveraging those applications at the API layer!\n\nWould appreciate any ideas, even partial ones. Thanks!!!\n\nEDIT: No replies yet but for context I'm able to dump 20M rows in 3s from my Fargate Spark Cluster. I then make queries using [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html) via Spark Connect (except in Scala). This lets me receive the results via Arrow and push them lazily into my Websocket response to my users, with a lot less infra code, whereas the Databricks ODBC connection (or JDBC connection, or their own libs) would take 3 minutes to do this, at best. It's just faster, and I think Spark 4 is a huge jump forward.\n\nEDIT2: While Spark Connect is a huge jump forward, using Databricks Connect is the way we are thinking about going with this (as it turns out Databricks connect is just a wrapper with Spark connect so we can still use the local instance as local development and have Databricks hoist our Spark cluster on the cloud; still maintaining the benefits; and as it turns out you can connect to Databricks compute nodes with Spark Connect vanilla and be fine).",

        "title": "Chuck Data - Agentic Data Engineering CLI for Databricks (Feedback requested)",
        "author": "caleb-amperity",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy name is Caleb, I am the GM for a team at a company called Amperity that just launched an open source CLI tool called [Chuck Data](https://chuckdata.ai). \n\nThe tool runs exclusively on Databricks for the moment. We launched it last week as a **free** new offering in research preview to get a sense of whether this kind of interface is compelling to data engineering teams. This post is mainly conversational and looking for reactions/feedback. We don't even have a monetization strategy for this offering. Chuck is free and open source, but just for full disclosure what we're getting out of this is signal to drive our engineering prioritization for our other products.\n\n# General Pitch\n\nThe general idea is similar to Claude Code except where Claude Code is designed for general software development, Chuck Data is designed for data engineering work in Databricks. You can use natural language to describe your use case and Chuck can help plan and then configure jobs, notebooks, data models, etc. in Databricks. \n\nSo imagine you want to set up identity resolution on a bunch of tables with customer data. Normally you would analyze the data schemas, spec out an algorithm, implement it by either configuring an ETL tool or writing some scripts, etc. With Chuck you would just prompt it with \"I want to stitch these 5 tables together\" and Chuck can analyze the data, propose a plan and provide a ML ID res algorithm and then when you're happy with its plan it will set it up and run it in your Databricks account.\n\nStrategy-wise, Amperity has been selling a SAAS CDP platform for a decade and configuring it with services. So we have a ton of expertise setting up \"Customer 360\" models for enterprise companies at scale with any different kind of data. We're seeing an opportunity with the proliferation of LLMs and the agentic concepts where we think it's viable to give data engineers an alternative to ETLs and save tons of time with better tools. \n\nChuck is our attempt to make a tool trying to realize that vision and get it into the hands of the users ASAP to get a sense for what works, what doesn't, and ultimately whether this kind of natural language tooling is appealing to data engineers.\n\nMy goal with this post is to drive some awareness and get anyone who uses Databricks regularly to try it out so we can learn together. \n\n# How to Try Chuck Out\n\nChuck is a Python based CLI so it should work on any system. \n\nYou can install it on MacOS via Homebrew with:\n\n    brew tap amperity/chuck-data\n    brew install chuck-data\n\nVia Python you can install it with pip with:\n\n    pip install chuck-data\n\nHere are links for more information:\n\n* Git repo: [https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data](https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data)\n* Website: [https://chuckdata.ai](https://chuckdata.ai)\n* Launch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA) \n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe](https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe)\n\nIf you would prefer to try it out on fake data first, we have a wide variety of fake data sets in the Databricks marketplace. You'll want to copy it into your own Catalog since you can't write into Delta Shares.  [https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity](https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity)\n\nI would recommend [the datasets in the \"bronze\" schema for this one specifically](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/6bc4843f-3809-4995-8461-9756f6164ddf/Amperity_Amperitys-Identity-Resolution-Agent-30-Day-Trial).\n\n  \nThanks for reading and any feedback is welcome!",

        "author": "thro0away12",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm somebody who worked as a data analyst, data scientist and now data engineer. I guess my role is more of an analytics engineering role, but the more I've worked in my role, it seems the future direction is to make my role completely non-technical, which is the opposite of what I was hoping for when I got hired. In my past jobs, I thrived when I was developing technical solutions in my work. I wanted to be a SWE but leap from analytics to SWE was difficult without more engineering experience, which is how I landed my role. \n\nWhen I was hired for my role, my understanding was that my job would be that I have at least 70% of the requirements fleshed out and will be building the solution either via Python, SQL or whatever tool. Instead, here's what's happening:\n\n* I get looped into a project with zero context and zero documentation as to what the project is\n* I quite frankly have no idea or any direction with what I'm supposed to do and what the end result is supposed to be used for or what it should look like\n* My way of building things is to use past 'similar projects', navigate endless PDF documents, emails, tickets to figure out what I should be doing\n* I code out a half-baked solution using these resources\n* I get feedback that the old similar project solution doesn't work, that I had to go into a very specific subfolder and refer to a documentation there to figure out something \n* My half-baked idea either has to revert back to completely starting from scratch or progressively starts to bake but is never fully baked \n* Now multiply this by 4, plus meetings and other tasks, so no time for even me to write documentation. \n* Lots of time, energy gets wasted in this. My 8 hour days have started becoming 12. I'm sleeping as late as 2-3 AM sometimes. I'm noticing my brain slowing down and a lack of interest in my work. but I'm still working as best as I can. I have zero time to upskill. I want to take a certification exam this year, but I'm frequently too burnt out to study. I also don't know if my team will really support me in wanting to get certs or work towards new technical skills. \n* On top of all of this, I have one colleague who constantly has a gripe about my work - that it's not being done faster. When I ask for clarification, he doesn't properly provide it. He constantly makes me feel uncomfortable to speak b/c he will say 'I'm frustrated', 'I wanted this to be done faster', 'this is concerning'. Instead of constructive feedback, he vents about me to my boss and their boss. \n\nI feel like the team I work on is very much a firm believer that AI will eventually phase out traditional SWE and DE jobs as we know today and the focus should be on the aspects AI can't replace, such as us coming up with ways to translate stakeholder needs into something useful. In theory, I understand the rationale, in practice....I just feel translation aspect will always be midly frustrating with all the uncertainties and constant changes around what people want. I don't know about the future though, whether or not trying to upskill, learn a new language or get a cert is worth my time or energy if there won't be money or jobs here. I can say thugh those aspects of DE are what I enjoy the most and why I wanted to become a data engineer. In an ideal world, my job would be a compromise between what I like and what will help me have a job/make money. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. Should I just stay in my role and evolve as an eventual business analyst or product manager or work towards something else? I'm even open to considering something outside of DE like MLE, SWE or maybe product management if it has some technical aspects to it. ",

        "content": "I'm not talking about Gen AI doing data engineering work... specifically what does data engineering look like for supporting Gen AI services/products?\n\nBelow are a few thoughts from what i've seen in the market and my own building; but I would love to hear what others are seeing!\n\n1. A key differentiator for quality LLM output is providing it great context, thus the role of information organization, data mining, and information retrieval is becoming more important. With that said, I don't see traditional data modeling fully fitting this paradigm given that the relationship are much more flexible with LLMs. Something I'm thinking about is what are identifiers around \"text themes\" an modeling around that (I could 100% be over complicating this though).\n\n2. I think security and governance controls are going to become more important in data engineering. Before LLMs, it was pretty hard to expose sensitive data without gross negligence. Today with consumer focused AI, people are sending PII to these AI tools that are then sending it to their external APIs (especially among non-technical users). I think people will come to their senses soon, but the barriers of protection via processes and training have been eroded substantially with the easy adoption of AI.\n\n3. Data integrations with third parties is going to become trivial. For example, say you don't have budget for Fivetran and have to build your own connection from Salesforce to your data warehouse. The process of going through API docs, building a pipeline, parsing nested JSON, dealing with edge cases, etc takes a long time. I see a move towards offloading this work to AI \"agents\" (loaded term now I know), but essentially I'm seeing traction with MCP server. So data eng work is less around building data models for other humans, but instead for external AI agents to work with.\n\nIs this matching what you are seeing?\n\nedit: typos",

        "content": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm wondering if someone here can help me piece something together. In my job, I think I have reached the boundary between data engineering and data science, and I'm out of my depth right now.\n\nI work for a government contractor. I am the only data scientist on the team and was recently hired. It's government work, so it's inherently a little slow and we don't necessarily have the newest tools. Since they have not hired a data scientist before, I currently have more infrastructure-related tasks. I also don't have a ton of people that I can get help from - I might need to reach out to somebody on a totally different contract if I wanted some insight/mentorship on this, which wouldn't be impossible, but I figured that posting here might get me more breadth.\n\nVaguely, there is an abundance of data that is (mostly) stored on Oracle databases. One smaller subset of it is stored on an ElasticSearch cluster. It's an enormous amount that goes back 15 years. It has been slow for me to get access to the Oracle database and ElasticSearch cluster, just because they've never had to give someone access before that wasn't already a database admin.\n\nI am very fortunate that the data (1) exists and (2) exists in a way that would actually be useful for building a model, which is what I have primarily been hired to do. Now that I have access to these databases, I've been trying to find the best way to work with the data. I've been trying to move toward storing it in parquet files, but today, I was thinking, \"this feels really weird that all these parquet files would just exist locally for me.\" Some Googling later, I encountered this concept of a \"data lake.\"\n\nI'm posting here largely because I'm hopeful to understand how this process works in industry - I definitely didn't learn this in school! I've been having this nagging feeling that \"something is missing\" - like there should be something in between the database and any analysis/EDA that I'm doing in Python. This is because queries are slow, it doesn't feel scalable for me to locally store a bunch of parquet files, and there is just no single, versioned source of \"truth.\"\n\nIs a data lake (or lakehouse?) what is typically used in this situation?",

While these comparisons may not capture all differences, they offer a useful understanding of performance speed. For this purpose, Coiled / Dask have introduced a challenge where data warehouse engines can benchmark their reading and aggregation performance on a dataset of 1 trillion records. This dataset contains temperature measurement data spread across 100,000 files. The data size is around 2.4TB.\n\n**The challenge**\n\n“Your task is to use any tool(s) you’d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3: s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also generate the data yourself.”\n\n**The Result**\n\nThe Apache Impala community was eager to participate in this challenge. For Impala, the code snippets required are quite straightforward — just a simple SQL query. Behind the scenes, all the parallelism is seamlessly managed by the Impala Query Coordinator and its Executors, allowing complex processes to happen effortlessly in a parallel way.\n\n**Article**\n\nhttps://itnext.io/the-one-trillion-row-challenge-with-apache-impala-aae1487ee451?source=friends_link&sk=eee9cc47880efa379eccb2fdacf57bb2\n\n**Resources**\n\nThe query statements for generating the data and executing the challenge are available at \nhttps://github.com/boroknagyz/impala-1trc",

They'll also add only what's the absolute minimum. How are they going to maintain all that mess?  \n\nThey also think the API doesn't need any sorting or filtering and querying millions of rows daily is fine even though the rate limiting doesn't allow it. To me the point of an API is that it serves all the common use cases and is a pretty universal way to interface with the system. I think they are making things difficult on purpose and artificially creating themselves billable hours. ",

Since all these servers are in LAN, storage is mounted via nfs on both trino worker and coordinator and hive catalog server. When I create table from trino, It creates it, and acts as a success, even when later i insert values into it and select it, it acts as everything is normal, even selecting .\"table$files\" works as expected showing correct path. But when I check the path its meant to be writing into, its empty. as I create a table, an empty folder with table name and uuid is created, but no data/metadata inside. Most likely it is being cached somewhere, because if i reboot the trino server (and not restart trino, bcz that does not change it), the message says: \n\nQuery <id> failed: Metadata not found in metadata location for table <table\\_name>\n\nbut cant create same table before I drop current one. BTW, dropping the table is also success, but does not remove the folder from the original storage.

It has significantly less powerbi than I expected and is actually 80% modelling / DWH work.\n\nThere isn’t any direct Data employee, they have a consultant that visits once every 2 weeks and I can contact him online. When he’s teaching me he’s very helpful and I learn a lot. But like any consultant he’s incredibly bizzy as per usual.\n\nThere is so much I still need to learn and realize. I am 22, and super willing to learn more in my free time, luckily my work environment isn’t soulcrushing but I want to make something of the opportunity. So far my work has provided me with udemy and I’m also going to get DataCamp. Still I was wondering if any of you guys had advice for me to improve myself and become a worthy Data engineer / data guy.\n\nSince right now it almost feels like starting as junior dev again that doesn’t know crap. But I’m motivated to work to get past that point. I just get the feeling it might not come from just doing my best at my workplace, just like when I was working as a webdev. I don’t want to fall behind my age <=> expected skill level\n\nWish you guys a good day and thank you for whatever advice you can help me out with.\n\nHope to have a long and succesful career in data :)",

But the moment I began typing, I blanked out. I couldn’t recall even the basic syntax of JavaScript or Python. I could hear their laughter in my own head, even though no one mocked me directly. It was deeply embarrassing.\n\nIn that moment, I started questioning my skills and every decision that brought me here. I’ve built several projects, some quite complex, like an image size compressor but none of that mattered when I failed to write a basic loop. Maybe it was the nerves, or maybe I just froze under pressure. I’m not entirely sure.\n\nI don’t know if it’s appropriate to share this here, but I felt the need to. This experience shook me. I realize now that I need to revisit the basics, not out of shame, but because I owe it to myself to rebuild with confidence.",

However, despite all my efforts, I’m starting to feel pretty dumb. It seems like everyone around me (especially the younger folks) is just picking it up so easily, and I’m struggling to even understand the basics sometimes.\n\nI guess I just feel a bit discouraged. Maybe I’m too old for this? But I really don’t want to give up just yet.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation or can offer advice on how to keep going? Any tips on how to break through the initial confusion? Maybe a different learning approach or resources that worked for you?\n\nThanks in advance, I appreciate any help!",

Batch scripts. Not high on my list, but I want to read this some day.

If you do web stuff you need to sit down and read a CSS book cover to cover instead of faking your way through it.)\n* [The Recursive Book of Recursion](https://nostarch.com/recursive-book-recursion) (My book, so I recommend it. Recursion is intimidating mostly because it's poorly taught.)\n* [Write Great Code, Volume 3: Engineering Software](https://nostarch.com/greatcode3)\n* [Learn Physics with Functional Programming](https://nostarch.com/learn-physics-functional-programming)\n* [C++ Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/cppcrashcourse) (Also on my list.

You didn’t have to memorize everything to actually do math in real life.\n\nThat’s kind of where my question about coding comes in. Back in the day, it seemed like you needed to know more off the top of your head so you weren’t constantly stopping to look things up, which could slow you down. But with AI tools now, where you can have help writing code and explanations, is it different?\n\nHow much of actual programming do you really need to memorize these days? Is it enough to just understand what’s happening at a high level, to know what you’re trying to do and why it works, and just look up the details as you go? Or is it still important to know all the algorithms, data structures, and other fundamentals in order to really be a programmer and write solid code?\n\nI guess I’m trying to compare it to math class, where it felt like they acted as if you’d never be allowed to use a calculator or look something up, when in reality you could. So I’m asking any professional programmers out there: Do you just know a lot of this stuff naturally because you’ve been doing it for so long, or do you think it’s still essential to learn and really know certain core things, with everything else being okay to look up as needed?\n\n",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I see a lot of posts, particularly from people trying to learn about the dangers of AI. I think it's very easy to misuse it but there are a few simple things we can all do to keep ourselves growing. The issue with AI is that it's answers are too easy so they don't \"stick\" in your mind.\n\n1) Never copy and paste code. This applies to tutorials as well. The act of typing will help you remember. Pair this with consciously thinking about everything you type and scrolling through IDE intellisense suggestions.\n\n2) Always ask for an explanation. Even for simple things, just reading the explanation can help your brain.\n\n3) Get familiar with documentation. AI can spit out an answer, but it isn't necessarily giving you the best answer. Looking at docs (if they are good) will show you different ways of using certain features or components. Alternatively, ask AI for different options and explanations of what works best in what situations.\n\n4) Ask about design patterns and Strategies rather than specific code snippets. This has helped me a ton. It's easy to find an article about why x is better than y, but the reality is most of the time each strategy fits a different requirement better and sometimes it's about how you want to build your system. \n\n5) if you don't need AI, don't use it. Even if it takes you a little longer to do something, forcing your brain to recall something will signal to your brain that that information is important and we should keep it. If you overly rely on AI, your brain will stop retaining the information. The same thing happens in a relationship. If your partner is responsible for feeding the pets, it's hard for you to remember. That is shared memory and it happens with AI.",

        "content": "I started learning programming last month with the final intention of making my dream game (like every person ever that learns to program). Started with editing (see: copying code into and altering) a 3D character controller state machine for godot, was pretty proud that I got it so that the player couldn't uncrouch underneath something and adapted someone else's code to make a leaning system. Realized the 3D game idea was way way too outside of my skill set so I downgraded to 2D, worked on that a bit, got caught up making screenshot mockups cause I'm an artist, barely really coded anything but figured that this was still too hard for me probably. Tried making pong. Too hard. Finally I just ate my pride and said I'd shed the need of trying to learn to program and learn a game engine at the same time and now I'm making a text adventure game in python.\n\nThe reason I had my first win is cause I've had such a hard time coding anything by myself. I've always needed a tutorial and never come up with solutions on my own. I needed a bit of help to get this project rolling but overall but now I'm able to open up VS Code and work alone with googling and documentation reading. I made a really basic save system on my own! Came up with the problem, thought about it, and came to a solution on my own! It's far from robust or complex, there are probably a million better ways to do this but I did it by myself and I'd say it's reasonably complex considering I was having troubles coding a 2D character controller on my own.\n\nI've got a long way to go but I think this is a good ass win. Time to let my ego get to me and scope creep a choose your own adventure book.",

I have no experience in Python so I may be VERY wrong. But personally, even though I can understand Python code to a good extent, the indentation just throws me off and makes reading nested code a HEADACHE for me because I have to take a hot second on each line to see where the indentation begins and ends. Now, this could all be because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but isn't the whole point of Python to be easy to read and understand? It is easy to read, I understand most code snippets out there, but the whole indentation thing is just so confusing to me. Is this a normal thing to say?

That's (more or less) why we have the very popular rule of thumb in Python: multithreading for I/O-bound work, multiprocessing for CPU-bound work.\n\nAlso thank you to u/HQMorganstern for the more detailed explanation",

Watching the channel grow over the years and gain millions of subscribers has been awesome.\n\nLately though, I’ve noticed that most of the content has been focused on AI, especially in the Code Report series. I totally understand why AI is huge right now, and those videos are pulling crazy numbers. But I kind of miss his older content, like the classic “100 Seconds of (Tech)” videos, the JavaScript survival guide, or Web Dev 101. That kind of content was gold, especially for new and intermediate devs or engineers trying to get a solid grip on different technologies quickly.\n\nIt does seem like Fireship is aware of this he even mentioned in the recent MCP tutorial video that it’s still a tutorial channel. So it’s nice to see that acknowledgment. And to be fair, even his newer videos still have that signature humor and creativity that made his channel stand out in the first place.\n\nOverall, I still really enjoy his channel and respect what he’s doing. It’s been a valuable resource for a lot of programmers, developers, engineers. Fireship has played a big role in making learning tech feel less intimidating and more fun, and that’s something I’ll always appreciate. ",

I even spent days reading Reddit threads and Quora answers trying to “find the best roadmap.”\n* Guess what? I wasted 3 full months doing just this. Minimal progress. Constant overwhelm. I wasn’t practicing,  I was just researching how to practice.\n* It hit me hard when my senior told me: The best resource is the one you actually stick to.\n* That’s when things changed. I picked one creator whose teaching style I liked. I stopped second-guessing and stuck to their roadmap. Within weeks, I saw more clarity and growth than I had in the past few months.\n* Here’s what I learned: You don’t need 10 resources. Give yourself 1-2 days max to pick a creator/platform. Then stop looking. Start solving. That’s where the growth is.\n* Don’t fall into the trap that the next video or roadmap will finally unlock it. Progress doesn’t come from finding the perfect guide, it comes from showing up and putting in the reps.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, learn from my mistakes. Pick one solid resource. Trust it.

Like, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn. They're awesome and do so much, but my brain is just not retaining all the different functions.\n\nI can usually tell you what a function does if you say the name(almost all of them), but when I'm actually coding, it's like my mind just goes blank. I'm constantly looking stuff up. It feels like I'm trying to memorize an entire dictionary, and it's making me wonder if I'm doing this all wrong.\n\nFor anyone who's been through this, especially if you're from a non-CS background like me: Am I supposed to memorize all these functions? Or is it more about just knowing the concepts and then figuring out how to find the right tool when you need it?\n\nAny advice would be super helpful. Feeling a bit stuck and just trying to get a better handle on this.\n\nThanks a bunch!",

And one in tk also long ago.\n\nI learned and know python modestly, and C, as well as Perl and basic shell seem possibly relevant. \n\nI am interested to make a GUI that’s essentially a big database hash/dictionary etc.   I don’t want to get deep into that.  Those details are in my domain and shouldn’t matter so much, but text based things a user enters and types in or I can parse and input.  \n\nI am out of tune with the latest SW methods.   What would be a good approach to make a GUI?   Tk in Linux?  Python (I have pycharm but I usually have at most a file or two for simple things, toy or specific algm problems, never a gui)?  \n\nI am not quite sure what direction to research, and am just looking for some pointers what direction to go for easy gui creation and maybe good database methods (sql?).  I’d like to start with a simplistic thing to create a GUI on a WinPC or RHEL setup, then I should be able to move from there if I can get my inputs and outputs aliv.  Any advice to what’s common now would be helpful. \n\nThanks\n\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone , I'm a beginner who recently built a Math Expression Evaluator and a Big Integer Arithmetic engine (from scratch , without using eval() or any library ). I’m wondering where should I go next?”\n\nWhat I currently know -\n    \n1) **Python** : Im fairly confident with \"Logic\" par  (But i'll call myself Okay-ish , since havent explored other libraries yet ... )\n\n2) **C++** : I recently started learning C++ (mainly for DSA ) \n\n3) **HTML** (absolute beginner here )\n\n\n I have solved 20 problems in leetcode , mostly easy and a couple mediums (most of them were in python but im slowing transitioning to c++ , tbh I feel like I can do them all in any language if ik the syntax )\n\n\nNow ,\n\nProjectsI Built So Far -->\n\n\n **1. Mathematical Expression Evaluator** (Purely Python)     (No Eval() used , built from scratch)\n\n[**[Github]**](https://github.com/SkySaksham/math-expression-evaluator)\n\n- A terminal-based  that can evaluate complete math expressions like: ((5 + 3) * 7)^2 ÷ (4 - 2)) ...\n- Supports order of operations BODMAS precedence (BRACKETS TOO) ...\n- handles unary minus , negative numbers ...\n- The entire parser is built from scratch and no external libraries are used .. \n\nI'm looking forward to adding variable support in it too , \n\neg --> evaluate( \"x= 5\") then evaluate(\"y=x+4\") then evaluate ( \"2(5x+4y)\" ) \n\n\nI also got to know about SHUNTING YARD ALGORITHM , idk anything atm but im looking forward to exploring it (and then I have another project in mind too )\n\n\n\n**2. Long Integer Arithmetic Engine**  (C++ , built from scratch ) --\n\n[**[Github]**](https://github.com/SkySaksham/Long_Integer_Arithmetic)\n\nThis started when I tried writing a simple factorial function in C++ but realized it couldn’t return 120! because of datatype limits ...\n\n\nSoo .. Built a Big Integer Engine that can handle numbers with hundreds of thousands of digits ..\nAll using digit by digit operations in vectors ..\nI also TRIED to document it very well , added docstrings and all too ...\n\nAtm , it can perform addition ,multiplication, factorial , power ...\n(I did CALCULATED 120! , in fact even returned 2500! )\n\nI have another thing in mind , to CALCulate millions of digits of pie from SCRATCH ... Atm idk how to do it , but i'll look into it deeper ...\n\n\n**3.Cinebook_Movie_Reservation_System**\n(Python , os & time & colorama Modules used)\n(This was my high school project ) \n\n[**[Github]**](https://github.com/SkySaksham/Cinebook_Movie_Reservation_System) \n\nA terminal-based movie ticket booking app called CineBook.\nBuilt a UI entirely in the terminal using:\n- Colorama (for colored text/UI)\n- time, os modules (for effects and screen clearing)\n\nHandles seat booking, shows seat layout, and simulates a basic movie booking system.\n\nDemo Video Link -> [**[Youtube]**](https://youtube.com/shorts/t6J7li7w1B4?si=KqmszEmisBXokJXD)\n\n\n**Fun Fact**, I built all these projects ON MY SMART PHONE ...\n\n**____________________**\n\n- At what point can I consider that I \"know enough\" in a programming language?\n- Should I go down the Web Development path (HTML, CSS, JS, then React + Django/Flask backend) OR\n- Should I go towards Data Science / AI / Machine Learning (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, then PyTorch/TensorFlow)?\n- At what stage should I start thinking about internships? Is it realistic to get one in the first year itself?\n\n\nI’m also exploring GitHub and have recently started looking into open-source contributions. I checked out SymPy but it feels a bit complex at first , hope to start small and figure it out over time ...\n\n\nApologies if any of these questions seem naive. I’m still figuring things out but I’m genuinely excited to learn more and improve.\nAny advice, suggestions, or guidance would mean a lot ..\n\nThank you so much for reading !!",

After about 6–9 years in this role, is there really anywhere to go?\n\nLet’s be real — it’s a simple job. You build screens, hook up APIs, and maybe add some animations or state handling here and there. But when it comes to core business logic, anything that actually requires deeper system thinking or architectural decisions — all of that is almost always at the backend (for good reasons).\n\nAnd honestly, most app devs I’ve worked with don’t even try to go beyond that. Very little interest in performance optimization, state management patterns, or even understanding what happens behind the API. It’s mostly a UI plumbing job.\n\nSo I’m wondering — is this it? Do people just keep doing the same thing for 10–15 years until they’re replaced by younger devs who can do the same job for cheaper? Or is there a natural transition path (into BE, product, or something else) that actually makes sense?\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve been in the app dev track longer or made a pivot.\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I work at a fairly established but small company that had about 200 people when I started. Now it’s down to about 120. No layoffs but there’s been some people singled out and fired, and a ton of churn.  I suspect a lot of problems here are happening in the industry as a whole. \n\nFor product and eng it’s 100% driven by low engagement and burnout. I only started here in August but it’s been a straight trend of just doing everything wrong. New product leader came in around when I did. Slowly ripped away any authority that ICs/managers have to define their scope or what to prioritize. It’s extremely top-down, do whatever the cofounders want now, and that was fairly insulated when I started. They’ve pushed out any and all leadership that were a source of any friction at the top, and I think they saw this new leader they hired was gonna validate anything they say. Now it’s only yes-people in the room. Teams and reorgs constantly happen at whims of leadership without really consulting anyone. This then impacts roadmap items but the expectations don’t change. Roadmap itself is never even really committed too, cause they change priorities there all the time, you never know when or why the thing you were working on for three weeks will get deprioritized. You also don’t know when something you thought you’d do a month later you’re now expected to present a prototype of at the end of the week. A lot of expected overtime work, not a lot of pay or advancement opportunity. Definitely a lack of clarity or support on directions given. I’ve seen people ask valid questions get put on PIPs basically. \n\nAs a designer I can definitely say this is not a place I expect to do great work or anything I can really showcase. The top down mandate is quite simply, AI-wash the product. I worked on a project with that mandate, just impossible constraints and no scope clarity. So I had to challenge that team to really turn this into something that customers would value and pay for and set a small target. With the full support and backing of my manager we really pushed to make sure it’s at least providing real value to the user, compromised as quickly as possible when necessary to unblock Eng (we were all building the plane while flying it). We really inserted ourselves so that we don’t make terrible UX decisions even and especially when that made things a little harder. Worked really hard on it, set a bar for quality. Executives swooped in last two weeks before launch and started asking for tons of changes, same timeline. So, lost time QAing there that really would have made a difference. Delayed the launch. They freaked out and blamed everyone they were pushing to work 80 hour weeks for a month to get this done. An eng quit on the spot which I applaud. Sure enough it launched and immediately sold enough to make the company profitable for its first quarter in like two years. Did we get any additional respect or acknowledgement, maybe some trust and respect for our process? lol. Well, that product leader got all the credit somehow despite having very little involvement. They got a promotion, and my manager, the one really backing me up challenging them and the team, got demoted, so no design voice in the leadership room now. This is the same product leader who’s entire staff either quit or been let go since they joined, and a replacement hired for most of them. Despised by everyone in product, design, and eng now. Yet, great at rubbing shoulders with management and pleasing them. Way too small of a company for politics like that to really work, but sure enough they convinced founders that they’re the goat. \n\nThey have multiple engagement surveys where we’ve basically flatlined to zero on product side since that leader started. Feedback has been given calling out leadership as the source. None of the driving behavior changed or was addressed by them, it only got worse. Then Eng started to feel the impact of this over the last 6 months. A lot of them started quitting, the best ones that had been there longest and had most domain knowledge. most recent engagement shows a big dip for them now too. Def cannot replace them faster than they quit right now and it’s an existential risk. It’s looking like the ship is gonna sink itself here. \n\nI’m also just wondering if there’s greener grass or is this just how the industry is gonna be for a while? Business idiots running everything into the ground with zero accountability, and ICs treated like disposable resources who can be replaced by AI if they go. It’s frustrating cause if they actually empowered us a bit more, we have the talent and means of making a great product that actually sells, but it’s like their own egos take priority and they can’t conceive of anyone knowing the business opportunities worth investing in other than themselves. Down to the micromanaged details, like they don’t trust or value the expertise they hired. \n\n",

I’ve shown initiative, asked for help, and tried to connect with more experienced people, but I keep hitting walls. I made a post recently about being gatekept by a senior. Since then, it’s only gotten harder mentally.\n\nMost days I work 9 hours and spend another 6 learning. I’m trying to grow fast and make up for lost time. I work from home, but I barely get time with my 3-year-old son. By the time I’m done, he’s already asleep. I know I’m missing important moments, but I’m doing this to build a better future for him.\n\nThe real challenge is that I’m from a developing country in Asia, and there aren’t many local opportunities to meet mentors or like-minded people. Platforms like Meetup don’t work well here.\n\nIs there any online space, Discord, Slack group, forum, or even a subreddit where people are serious about learning, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other? I’m willing to contribute, show up every day, and help others where I can. I just need to be around people who believe in growth the way I do.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated.

This is completely opposite to how it was when I entered the workforce in 2020. In 2020, people were excited to talk to me and reaching out all the time regardless of where I lived. Now they don't care what my qualifications are, how talented I am, what my skill set is. They just won't even consider me at all it's like they just close the door in a huff and cut off communications if I'm not directly in the local area. \n\n\nI can give you one example. Lowe's the hardware store. Back in 2021 they were trying to recruit me even though I wasn't in the area. I talked to the same recruiter again couple weeks ago, and she was very dismissive and condescending about me not wanting to relocate to Charlotte North Carolina, and was very adamant about the fact that I would have to drive outside of Charlotte about 20 mi north of the city to Morrisville where the job was located, which is honestly kind of stupid if you ask me? Why would I go and move to a big city right? And then live out in the middle of nowhere to commute to this weird corporate office. So I would basically be making my life worse and more costly",

Technically, I’ve been eligible to graduate for the past year, but I’ve been deliberately delaying it to continue doing internships and gain experience while at the same time applying for full-time jobs. My plan was always to hit the graduation button the moment something landed.\n\nSo far, I’ve racked up **28 months of internship experience**, mostly including software and hardware development at places like Dell Technologies and a space agency. And yet, I’m still struggling to land a full-time role, let alone an interview.\n\nThe job market here in Vancouver (and across Canada) has been... bleak. I’ll admit I’ve been picky, wanting to stay in here, but it's been *REALLY* tough. I’m feeling incredibly stuck and unsure of how to move forward.\n\nI have some options that I'm considering, but I just don't know which move is best\n\n1. Delay graduation again to do an Undergraduate Thesis in Robotics, hopefully to fluff my GPA a bit and make me more competitive for grad school. Problem is, though I have considered a master's program, I don't even know what I'd want that to be in.\n2. Graduate in August and spend day and *night* applying for jobs. Figure out a grad school to go to later and hope my CV is good enough to get in. Maybe do an accounting diploma in the evenings as a back-up (I've heard the memes, I did have a friend successfully land a job after a year of their diploma though)\n3. Go into Electrical trades (my friend spent 8 months looking for work and started doing this when he couldn't find anything).\n4. Join the Air Force\n\nFor those in similar shoes, what did you do?

        "content": "I am a ~~Senior~~ Backend Engineer who has never made it past Junior. I got fucked over by two jobs in a row over the past 4 years which held me back. Its a long story so I'll try to keep it somewhat short (because oh boy there is so much more I could talk about).\n\nThe first one was one I held for 3 years. The company was tumultuous and there was high turn over, and a year into the job, half of the engineers were gone and replaced, and by year 3, I was the longest tenure engineer at the company. When I first started there, we had no titles besides Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer. 2 years in, they decided they wanted to be more like other companies and decided to implement bands. At this point, I was doing system design, db design, security, re-architecture work, introducing process changes, leading meetings, mentoring, etc. I was pushing to get a promotion, because I was doing way more senior work than other seniors in the company, but I was told that they were making a rubric and had frozen promotions for 6 months.\n\nSo, 6 months go by and we have this new salary/title band system, and we get a new HR system as well. I don't think too much of it until one day I go to submit some time off, and under my profile name, it says \"Software Engineer I\", the lowest title level. I'm stunned and go look at the org chart and out of 40 engineers, I am the ONLY ONE who is a Software Engineer I. I bring it up to the engineering manager and he tells me to just go through the review process and it should be fixed with the new rubric. So review time comes around and I finally get the rubric that I had been asking for for a month, and the new rubric ends up blocking my promotion.\n\nWhy? Because whoever made the rubric decided one of the requirements to go from Engineer I to Engineer II is that you have \"Taken responsibility when your changes were responsible for a critical error\". Problem is, after 2.5 years, I never introduced a show-stopping bug. I was the only engineer in the company who never introduced a show-stopping bug. So apparently, I failed that requirement, so they weren't going to give me a promotion. I ended up getting laid off with a bunch of other people 6 months after.\n\nThen last year, I started working a job that was supposed to be a Senior Engineer position, but even though I did great on the interviews, because my previous position wasn't as a \"Senior\", they wouldn't give me the senior title. At this point, things were starting to get pretty bad with the job market and I was desperate, so I took it. Ended up getting laid off again with people late last year.\n\nNow, with how bad the market has gotten, I am struggling to get any traction. I am one of those devs who truly loves writing software, and I've loved it since I first tried it out in high school just for fun. I'm not the most genius engineer or anything like that, but I truly love it, and its not about the money for me. But these past 4 years have really killed my drive and motivation. Now here I am, barely getting any traction while job-searching for months, and since every job posting out there is for Senior+, I'm getting filtered out of jobs left and right. At this point, should I just \"lie\" (or rather, correct what titles I should have had)?",

My thinking was that I'd take the route of automating everything I can to impress the devs and join them at the company, but no such luck. My company is mostly foreign, with about 70% of the staff being Chinese... including the entirety of the devs. I don't speak Chinese, and there's a blatant opportunity/ compensation bias towards my Chinese coworkers. Nonetheless, I get a few Automation certs, make a couple projects specifically for the company's benefit with the previous stack, and it gets me nowhere. A \"Thank you! Now get back to work\", and a 2% annual bump in my salary. So, while still trying to create applications/software to benefit my company, my main work has been devolved into manual testing. I'm desperately doing anything I can to code. But I feel like I've got the QA brand on me now after this long.\n\nThen I get home, see 3-5 more rejections from the prior days applications, apply to 15-20 more, leetcode, work on projects/ certs, go to the gym and lift out my frustration, and go to bed. It's been like this for **2 and a half years** now, and I'm losing my mind. I spend most of my days feeling like an absolute failure, and hating myself over this, and it's effecting my relationships because people are picking up on it now. I see friends/ acquaintances of the same age buying homes, having kids etc., that went right into the trades after high school. And I'm still living at my parent's place. I just feel so incredibly cheated and disheartened that those 4 years in college and countless post-midnight study grind sessions, along with all of the extra effort post-grad haven't gotten me anywhere.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a CEO. I'm not applying to FANG or anything like that. Just all normal, average companies. I don't care to be wildly rich. I just want to be able to comfortably support a future family, and buy a house for them, and live out the American Dream.

        "content": "So a couple of years ago I wrote a script that did some clever tricks with the clipboard to streamline the otherwise manual effort of data population into an excel worksheet.  I mainly wrote it for myself because I absolutely despise repetitive work, but word got around when I showed it to ONE person and I was persuaded to turn it into a standalone GUI tool.  \n\nEventually that task I entirely automated wasn't my responsibility anymore as I got a promotion and went to work on other projects.  The individuals that wound up handling that task/responsibility heavily used my tool until it didn't work anymore because the structure of the source data changed, and the way the tool was written wasn't dynamic.  So of course, they reach out to me to update it.  \n\nI didn't really have time to update that thing, but they'd become so spoiled, I said okay.  So I rewrote it.  I implemented some pretty rudimentary data structures so it was dynamic and would work with any modifications to the source data.  I also implemented some fuzzy matching so it would populate accurately regardless, whether there were differences in case or trailing spaces or whatever.  One of the guys in the role decided to ask me for a walk through, because apparently, he has a CS degree.  He looked through the code of the older version (static/hard coded) and the new version (dynamic/fuzzy) and said he didn't understand the updates --so he was going to work with the first one.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday and he's giving a \"demo\" on his \"updates\".  On that call were members of management, eagerly anticipating something inventive and/or innovative from some supposed collaborative effort.  I join the call late because I was super busy, but when I get on, he's walking through the logic, workflow, and data structures that I wrote in the first and second version.  I'm sitting there like.. hmm.. this sounds like all of the functionality I built, and I'm wondering if I should air him out and let the entire group know.  Of course I didn't because I'm better than that, but I did ask what improvements or updates he made (that constituted the meeting).  The only thing he changed was swapping out one Excel read/write library for another, because the one I used (xlswriter) overwrites formulas in cells.  \n\nAnyway, so while the tool isn't all that much of a big deal, because, I pretty much hacked it together in a couple of hours altogether to save myself some time, I can't help feeling a little petty about this dude passing along my work as his own.  It's one thing to show the tool's usage, it's another to walk through the logic to upper-management, like he wrote the damn thing.  AITA for even caring at all?",

I was really happy to get the job, a pay bump over my last role even though I’d have to go to the office 3/week instead of being fully remote. I started Monday. I had a 1hr meeting with HR where I also received my computer and someone was supposed to pick me up after the meeting as my onboarding guide. They never showed up. The HR guy spent almost an hr walking around the campus with me trying to figure out I should go and reaching out to my manager for guidance. My manager is a in whole different city and apparently nothing was planned for me. I ended doing nothing that day besides getting my computer. I personally reached out to the manager and he said he would call me but didn’t on the first day.\n\n2nd day, I had absolutely nothing planned on my calendar. I had no idea what I was supposed to do, who to talk to, and where to even site. Early in the morning I reached out to my manager to explain the situation and he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guide. The whole day went by, nothing. Still nothing. And I still don’t have the guide.\n\nToday, 3rd… I had a one-hr HR meeting scheduled. Did that from 10 to 11. Since after that nothing else. I try to do some mandatory training that aren’t due for a full 6 months from now since I have nothing to do. I am on campus, not knowing where my desk is, who my teammates are, what my onboarding process is. Nothing. \n\nI feel like I am wasting my gas and money to go there just to sit in the cafeteria doing absolutely nothing. Tomorrow I’ll be “working” remotely. I have no idea what the plan is, nobody is saying anything to me, I don’t know anything about my benefits, I am not being helped by anyone.\n\nHow should I behave in a situation like this ",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for people who might have gone through what I’m going through right now, and how they overcame it. I recently graduated college so I haven’t seen most of the world as of yet. \n\nI’m a Junior dev right now. 2 years of experience - this is the first and only place I’ve worked at. And it’s the only team I’ve worked with. I joined here straight out of college. \n\nLately l have begun realizing just how emotionally invested I’ve become in this workplace. I’m so scared that this attachment will cause me to harm my own career as I would be resistant to switching jobs in the future, if I don’t fix this. \n\nFirst off, I have the best manager ever. Obviously I don’t have any reference points, as this is my first manager, but hearing stories from my friends - I consider myself to be pretty lucky. My manager is always pushing me to be the best, other senior leadership has told me that my manager talks very good about me to them, she is always available to explain things and is stern when I make mistakes. I’ve never been pinpointed or blamed for when Prod issues have happened, just reminded that these are very important incidents to learn from. I work in a finance heavy industry, so I had to learn A LOT about finance, and she taught me all of it. \n\nSecond, my team is flexible. We aren’t expected to log in early if the need isn’t there. My manager is also fine with me taking multiple consecutive days off together if need be. We aren’t too personal with each other and I like the boundaries that everyone maintains. \n\nThe work itself - it’s not tooooo interesting. I do work in finance, so it’s hard for me to accept what I’m doing actually matters. It feels like a zero sum game to me. The problems we solve with engineering have more to do with reducing the manual work for finance bros. So I always feel like I’m working underneath them as opposed to with them. The work hours can also stretch to 9/10 hours a day, sometimes.\n\nThe end users of the product are a pain in the ass. They are the finance bros and they have an attitude problem. I do not like working for them or along with them. They don’t understand the complexity of software systems. They think just because a feature sounds so simple in their head it’s simple to build as well. \n\nThe top-layer engineering leadership is also uninspiring. Their only motivation is (and they’ve spoken this out loud multiple times) to keep the finance bros happy and not lose our credibility in front of them. It feels like my job only exists to please them. \n\nWhich is why in my head I want to change jobs, maybe look for something more interesting, fun and inspiring. But then I’m reminded of my star manager and amazing team. What if I’m actually very lucky where I am right now? What if I change jobs and it’s a stupid decision? I could be stuck somewhere where the manager is ass and working against me. I don’t know what to do. Is your guys’ work like this as well? ",

It's a tiny company, and the pay is nothing to write home about (I'm living with my dad since I can't afford rent in my city) I'm learning a lot though, and there's many opportunities to lead feature initiatives within the company which is nice for a first job.

I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something. These posts saturate social media to the point where it seems like the only paths to wealth are: Get a big tech internship while in school and land a return offer, make a 7 figure startup, or be banished to irrelevancy.\n\nI'm interested in those of you that were (are) in my shoes; what would you recommend someone like me do to keep progressing their career and land a reputable job in some big tech company?

It is a remote position. \n\nI am currently working with another startup, which are not that competitive and we have been working over 3 years now. It is really flexible job, I actually travel a lot and we don't have any work hours, I just need to get my tasks done and join regular calls. \n\nNew position is offering 50% more pay, and possibility of getting raise as soon as I adopt the team. Downside is it is 9-5 job and I am in Europe, so I would need to work at late hours here. \n\nShould I accept the offer? There are no benefits since it is a contract based position, but I might get myself a much better offer from them if I prove myself in the team (maybe not!)\n\n  \nWhat would you guys do? :)",

It lasted from November 2023 to November 2024.\n\nI feel so lost.  I really like coding and stuff but I have some issues:\n\nI suck with coming up with ideas for projects.  I finally made one prototype app that uses sleepers api for fantasy football.  It was built in python django since that is what my internship used, but remaking it in Java/Springboot since I prefer Java (https://mysleeperapi.com/). I also deployed it on my own too.  It's not much, but it's kinda cool.\n\nRight now I have low motivation due to serious depression,  and it's getting worse. I sit infront of my PC all day when not at my crappy data entry job.  I have udemy courses that I try and follow, but even that is hard sometimes.\n\nI'm kinda older than the newer grad, I turn 29 on July 11th (so i was about to turn 27 when i graduated).  I'm afraid that due to my age and lack of experience, I'll never get my foot in the door.\n\nI also have the issue on not knowing what I should do and with the current job market, it feels like I have to learn everything.\n\nLastly I feel like my region sucks for tech jobs.  I live in Northeast Ohio in the Cleveland area.\n\nMy life feels so derailed, and of course I would graduate in 2023 when everything falls apart, and I can't image being a graduate in 2024 onward.\n\nIf this is what I have to look forward to, I'd rather not be around because it's bullshit. If not CS, then what?  Nothing else interests me so I'm supposed to be misearble?  I'm supposed to have my life together right now, but that isn't the case.\n\n",

        "content": "I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.\n\nWithin a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.\n\r\nAfter leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.\n\nI interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with \"Strong Hire\" and  “Hire” ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a \"No Hire\" for the technical part and rated \"Hire\" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.\n\nAfter this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development.  Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.\n\r\nI've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.\n\r\nAfter these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:\r\n1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.\r\n2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.\r\n3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.\n\r\nNow, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:\n\r\n1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?\r\n2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?\r\n3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?\r\n4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as \"Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)\" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?\r\n5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I’m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.\n\r\nTo anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance). Interviewed at 50+ top firms cleared 5, ghosted by 4, lowballed by 1. Took a break after a high-pay freelance gig; now out of work and savings running low. Built solid MERN stack projects. Need advice on CTC strategy, resume positioning, target companies, and rebuilding momentum.",

        "content": "Long story short, I landed an amazing job as a SWE. It's at a very well known FAANG+ company and the team is sort of new and we'll be working on some interesting problems. Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.\n\nThen there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).\n\nI never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.\n\nI realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.\n\nSo, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated!\n\n  \n**Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

While work hours and pay is decent, it is only a contract role, career progression is very slow if converted, and I have very little interest in my current industry. So I am looking to job hop in the next couple of years.\n\nI am competent at front end, but I struggle with backend tasks as I lack exp. I often require guidance on how to do stuff like Kafka streams, microservice programming in C#, SQL Schema configuration etc. In fact, it has come to the point where my team lead has stopped giving me backend tasks altogether, saying that I should just focus on front end for now, which was demoralising for me.\n\nI am definitely concerned for my future plans to job hop as I feel the competition. You have:\n\n1. Highflyer CS fresh grads who have tons of hackathon, internship and project exp who memorise all of Leetcode, and can easily land jobs at MNCs/Big Tech\n2. Offshore foreign devs who can do a junior’s work at a fraction of the cost and with more work hours\n3. AI LLMs which can streamline all the work of multiple junior devs\n\nMeanwhile there is me who cant even land a permanent role after uni grad and cant do backend coding to save his life.\n\nI am considering what to do at this point. My original idea was to read up on the side and do another web dev project tied to cloud services to showcase my fullstack skills, for a cause/industry that I’m passionate in. But the competition and job economy for devs will just not get easier from now on.\n\nRealistically however, would it be better for me as an average dev to eventually pivot to project management instead? From what I read, PM roles rely more on industry domain knowledge and soft skills, of which fresh grads, offshore devs, or AI LLMs would tend to not be as strong in. I do have some project leadership exp from various CCA and volunteering opportunities in the past. And of course, this still allows me to work on tech related projects.   \n  \nCan anyone advise me on this? Much appreciated.",

I get paid $36/hour but since it's 1099 taxes take nearly 20% of that. On top of taxes I am not getting the proper hours I need, 15-20 hours most weeks, but want at least 35-40hrs. When I started working with this company my project manager said after a few months they would bring me on as a full-time dev. That has yet to happen even after bringing it up 6 months into this position.\n\nAt this point I'm open to completely switching jobs but would rather get a second job that's completely asynchronous (or highly flexible) since my job now requires me to have a set schedule. I believe a second job would be better since sticking around for at least a year would show commitment but I'm unsure if that matters given my professional experience is so limited.\n\nWhile I have been looking and applying I feel pretty stuck/limited so any guidance on switching jobs or where to look for a completely asynchronous second job would be extremely appreciated.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've got 17 YOE but self taught, primarily frontend.\n\nI haven't been doing DSA a long time but I understand the most common ones I see in interviews (and honestly in my entire career I've rarely gotten LC in an interview, and yes I do think it's important for FE).\n\nw/ LC or any algo problem on any site, the problem I've found is I spend way too much time correcting for edge cases, or smaller bugs, and then I end up butchering my original solution to fit. It never fits, n this just tells me I don't actually know the algo well enough.\n\nI've developed some newer habits while prepping for some upcoming interviews, and I find that this approach I can learn the mechanics of the problem thoroughly and surprisingly I get success only after a couple clicks.\n\nI still spend a lot of time sussing out my solution, but in the end I feel like I really understand what to do.\n\nBasically:\n\n* I read the problem and based off what I currently know I just try to work it out in my head. I don't even write anything down. I just try to visualize it, with my current set of tools. A lot of walking around the house, talking to myself.\n* After I kinda adjust everything in my head, I open up AI chat and then i tell it my approach. I don't ask for code, I just want it to tell me what it thinks of my approach\n* I go back and forth repeatedly with AI on this. Until I have a better sense of what I want to code. Rinse & repeat, I still haven't written or asked for code\n* If i can't formulate something then I go to YT and look for a short on how the problem is generally solved - Neetcode is great for this because he'll visualize it for you before diving into code. I try to make sense of it before seeing how he solves the problem, but if it clicks then i don't even bother, but he does write in python often - I'm primiarly JS/TS so its nice that i still have to do the translation in my head\n* Then I finally start writing my approach and since I've gone over it repeatedly in my head, I have better direction. Your IDE will identify most of the silly bugs so, you just need to return something - this is my own IDE, not in LC's code editor.\n* When I'm done, I don't even run it - I just have AI review it and tell me again where I\"ve messed something up. Again, no code, just more back and forth with AI. Maybe I find that there's prob a better approach, so I redo my solution.\n* When AI (claude in my case) says it looks good, then I finally run it in leetcode/whatevercode. Usually there's minimal things i need to fix. I've been getting successful submits on the first try\n\nTLDR\n\nThis is basically me, a visual learner, self taught - drilling into my head what I think will be a solid approach based off what I actually understand well. The repetition and being corrected _in discussion_ is really really good for me. A lot more time is spent thinking about the problem and talking through the different parts of the solution. The least amount of time is on the code, and there's almost no trial and error clicking. Feels great.\n\nThe funny part is I don't really have the patience to go through the entire AI response, so I kinda skim just for \"this is where the problem is\". I don't even read the whole thing because I try to connect the dots of what its suggesting, on my own.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. And yes, it's midnight on a Friday, and I'm workin on DSA. Cheers!\n",

        "author": "shade_blade",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated in May 2025 but I have had basically no success in applying to places, most of the time I don't even get the screening phone call and there's only been a few times where I went anywhere further than that. I'm starting to feel like I won't ever get any actually good job at all.\n\nMost positions I see have hundreds of applicants, which makes me think I'll never get in any of them. I am not a top 0.1% candidate, I don't have million dollar side projects, years of experience or a lot of charisma. Plus, there are not a lot of new grad openings in my area (Indiana) and I'm pretty sure I get filtered out of any applications I make to anywhere outside of the state (exactly 0 places out of state actually went further than the first application before throwing my resume in the garbage). Obviously it's a bad idea to move somewhere else without a job lined up, but pretty much everywhere is only hiring locally? There's also the problem where more recently it seems like all the entry level stuff has completely dried up, I only find one thing every few days at this point (everything else seems to want people who are 3+ years of experience in everything for something that says \"entry level\") (Even when I look for random low level help desk and other things they want people with a ton of experience always, and also they want \"excellent communicators\" which is something I am not)\n\nMy [resume](https://imgur.com/a/xnfQFTn) is pretty bad but there's nothing significant I can change about it. The internships I got in college weren't really very computer science oriented (a lot of hardware stuff) which is just a big red flag on my resume I can't do anything with (sidenote: company A is like 1 guy so I probably can't go back there for a job, it's also not very programming based so I don't want to do it forever either). (sidenote 2: Yes I tried to get other internships, but my resume was even worse back then and the market wasn't exactly much better back then versus now). It probably looks bad that I had internships in the summer only but company A is a local place so I can't exactly stay there while going to college. I don't have metrics for everything which makes it look bad (are interns really supposed to be doing corporate espionage to look at company records to see the exact dollar value of everything they did?) (And I can't really lie and make up stuff since that would just look like obvious lies, some of the metrics I already have are already like that)\n\nI had a 3.93 GPA for my bachelors but that isn't actually very good (one of the people that interviewed me actually grilled me for not having a perfect 4.0, probably a reason I got rejected). Project wise I just have some projects on there, but those projects aren't \"real\" projects since 2 of them were class projects and the other one is something that didn't make money so companies probably just see it as just a random toy project. I'm also not an expert in all the 10 random technologies that get put in every job posting as well, which probably leads me to getting tossed out (even if I was, companies probably ignore everything that wasn't something I did in internships which cuts me out of 99% of positions)\n\n(My parents want me to apply to every random X years of experience position out there, which just seems pointless since in what world would I be put above the people who actually have X years of experience?)\n\n**Other things**\n\n* Networking\n   * Networking is a complete non starter as I don't have the social skills to ever convince someone that I'm the best person for the job. My personality is pretty unlikeable (very introverted, don't like talking, not really capable of showing enthusiasm) and I have very little in common with other people\n   * The people I've encountered in my classes aren't really going to help me either (presumably most of them are now entry level people as well and so they have 0 influence on the hiring process of any company)\n   * There's basically 0 chance I become the hiring managers best friend and become someone they push ahead of other people\n* Internships\n   * Not in college anymore, internships only take current students\n* Projects\n   * Making a \"good project\" isn't something I can just do. To make the kind of project that actually impresses employers I would have to make a significant amount of money, and those kind of ideas are very hard to come by. Plus, that kind of thing would take 1 year or several years to actually produce which I can't exactly spend that amount of time unemployed (or in some menial dead end job) without leaving me stuck in that job because they think I can't do anything better\n* Do more leetcode\n   * 99% of the time I don't even get to a point where they even give me any kind of technical evaluation, so it doesn't really help me to practice that more. It's not something I can put in a job application to get further\n* Move somewhere with more jobs\n   * Terrible idea, I don't have a ton of money to waste moving out somewhere (especially considering how badly my job search is going, moving somewhere else isn't going to magically be 100x better)\n* Lie on resume\n   * Also a complete non starter. I don't have the charisma to back up lies on my resume. Stretching experience numbers is something I'm already doing, but I can't just make up years of experience out of nowhere without making it look like obvious lies\n   * If I say I have experience at X place then that would get seen in a background check and then I get thrown out immediately\n\n\n\n",

I don’t mind it too much as I’m in good terms with her and she mostly leaves me the fuck alone because 90% of the time I close out all my tickets.\n\nI’ve been working on this project that uses a LLM model to generate some output, but I don’t think it’s the right project to solve with LLMs because of the inconsistencies/inaccuracies generated in the output. But my manager seems to be convinced that we can make it work, we just need to try harder (improve the prompt, adjust the code, etc.) My company has zero experience building AI products wants to jump in the AI bandwagon and my manager wants to impress c-suite folks by solving business problems with AI. I have voiced my concerns several times how we are trying to solve a problem with the wrong tool or how we should change our approach as the project requires a more deterministic output. I have been ignored everytime and was either asked to just “improve the process a little more” or “don’t think too much, it’ll be fine”. I put duck tapes here and there and the end product is shit. My manager convinced me its fine as long as we make efforts in a positive direction, and at the end if we can’t build this there’s no real repercussions. Long story cut short we are few months into the project and I had to demo the app to the client we are building this for and they weren’t impressed with the inconsistencies in the output. Because at the end of the day it’s nothing like what my manager promised them and they are on our asses to build a working solution ASAP.\n\nAt this point I think you can guess who’s on the hook for all of this? Fortunately the concerns I have expressed to her during the initial phase of the project is documented in emails. But at my company upper management doesn’t want to hear/doesn’t care if your direct manager is being a dick/is incapable and they tell you “you need to figure this out with your manager. Ain’t there nothing I can do about this”. So between me and my manager they’ll just take her word against mine (even with email proof) as I’m more “dispensable” in their eyes? If this project fails more than likely I’ll be blamed and let go as I’ve no doubt she’ll use me as a scapegoat.\n\nWhat’s my move here? I can’t just work harder during the weekends and crank this out. Really need your advice so I can form a strategy. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

        "content": "I've worked 3 jobs in my career.\n\nThe first was in defense industry (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc). I worked on a radar project that was pretty cool. Tbh, we hardly had meetings and just had stand up oince a day and outside of that it was mostly reaching out to people for help and once a month a product meeting with the clients. Once a quarter we had a 2 day sprint planning event that really was a waste of 2 days with most engineers just nodding along while the managers and POs did all the talking.\n\nSecond job was in FAANG - it seemed like even as a mid-level Engineer I had to spend half my day in meetings, a quarter of my day reaching out to people and the rest of the time coding. Obviously 2 hours coding isnt enough, so it caused people to have to work an extra 2-4 hours a day. Stand up was everyday for 30 minutes. No meetings friday was hardly respected. If you werent it felt like you were behind if your days didnt look like this. It was very on the go. Even in the meetings, it felt like everything was a discussion that took an extra hour of meeting time. ANythign brought up during parking lot took an hour to resolve. You put a for loop but a principal engineer wants you to do a while loop? Let's discuss it for an hour about why for loops are better or worse. If you needed to talk to anybody, you had to schedule time and theyd get annoyed if you went over the alloted scheduled time. It was stressfula nd when I left I was glad I was gone.\n\nCurrent job is at big tech but not FAANG - It seems meetings are the last thing on their mind. We have stand up twice a week. Twice a month we have an extended stand up. Even then it goes by pretty quickly (most of the time it takes half the scheduled time). Parking lot items are resolved really fast unless someone is confused about the code. Im still fairly new but i get the vibe that it's similar to my first job where you can just reach out to someone and tehy didnt mind spending an hour with you to talk it through. Once a quarter they do a \"no meetings week\" where major meetings are cancelled. This was a shocker i've never heard about, in my last job that is something laughable and seen as a waste of useful time. What's surprsiing is I make more in this job than I did in FAANG for what seems like will be less stress.\n\nJust wondering how common it is in other jobs when it comes to meetings?\n\nEdit: im 7 YOE as a backend SWE if that helps.

        "content": "I've been working in a mid-sized consulting company in the EU for about 3 years now. It’s stable, but its extemely boring, there’s no real growth, and I’m just mentally checked out at this point. It feels like I’m wasting my life. \n\nRecently I got the chance to interview with a super early-stage startup--10 people in total-- started by current and former researchers and professors. I don’t have all the details yet, but my expectation is that i will work more hours, which is fine. Right now, I just want to work on stuff and grow professionally. \n\nI’m aware of the risks: lower job security, and a lot of uncertainty. But staying where I am feels like a slow death career-wise. \n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience? Did it open new doors, or was it just stress in a different flavor?\n\nCheers\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I (24m), just graduated from college, and I’m blessed to have received an offer for SWE at a FAANG company. I was an intern twice and was asked to come back full time. Last week I found out that I will be working on a distributed systems team that codes almost entirely in C++. The product is internal and was the basis of an industry revered paper from the company in the early 2010’s, think Chubby or Kubernetes. I met with the manager a few days ago, and he seems really nice, but cautioned me that the work is quite challenging. \n\nOf course I am super grateful to be in such a position given the condition of the market, and I look forward to learning as much as I can. However, I can’t help but feel anxious about starting my new job. I have zero experience in distributed systems and did not even take the class since it was only offered at my school during my first year there. I did take a networking class, which touched a bit on some of the fundamentals of distributed systems (CAP theorem, concurrency), but really nothing practical and useful. My experience with C++ is quite limited as well, as I have mostly coded in Java and Python. \n\nWith that said, how can I succeed at my new job? What advice would you give to a new grad trying to learn as much as they can while delivering in what is likely a team full of experts? How do you fight the inevitable imposter syndrome? Any resources I can leverage? I recently picked up Designing Data-Intensive Applications and have been polishing up my C++, but I start in a couple of weeks so there is not much time. \n\nYour advice would be much appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",
