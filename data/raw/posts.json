But 90% of the data quality issues we get paged for are because the business logic changed and no one told us.\n\nA product manager wouldn't launch a new feature in an app without defining what quality means for the user. Why do we accept this for data products?\n\nWe're treated like janitors cleaning up other people's messes instead of engineers building a product. The root cause is a lack of ownership and clear requirements *before* data is produced.\n\nDiscussion Points:\n\n* Am I just jaded, or is this a universal experience?\n* How have you successfully pushed data quality ownership *upstream* to the product teams that generate the data?\n* Should Data Engineers start refusing to build pipelines until acceptance criteria for data quality are signed off?\n\nLet's vent and share solutions.",

Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.\n\nEven if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.\n\nIn my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.\n\nI actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.\n\nIs this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?\n",

It’s been running great ever since… but now I’m starting to wonder what’s next — because I need more power. ⚡️\n\nWe use GCP, and process hourly over 2M data points arriving in streaming to pub/sub, then saved to cloud storage.  \nHere goes the pipeline, with a proper batching  i'm able to use 4GB memory cloud run jobs to read parquet, process and export parquet.  \nUntil now everything is smooth, but at the final step this data is used by our dashboard, because polars + parquet files are super fast this used to work properly but recently some of our biggest clients started having some latency and here comes the big debate:\n\nI'm currently querying parquet files with polars and responding to the dashboard\n\n\\- Should i give more power to polars ? mode cpu, larger machine ...\n\n\\- Or it's time to add a Data Warehouse layer ...\n\nThere is one extra challenging point: the data is sort of semi structured. each rows is a session with 2 attributes and list of dynamic attributes, thanks to parquet files and pl.Struct the format is optimized in buckets:\n\n    <s_1, Web, 12, [country=US, duration=12]\n    <s_2, Mobile,13, [isNew=True,...]\n\nMost of the queries will be group\\_by that would filter on the dynamic list (and you got it not all the sessions have the same attributes)  \nThe first intuitive solution was BiGquery, but it will not be efficient when querying with filters on a list of struct (or a json dict)\n\nSo here i'm waiting for you though on this what would you recommend ?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "author": "Worried_Teaching_707",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working as an AI Architect consultant for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company, and we're in the final forecasting stage for a new \"AI Co-pilot\" feature. This agent is customer-facing, designed to let their Pro-tier users run complex queries against their own data.\n\nThe projected API costs are raising serious red flags, and I'm trying to benchmark how others are handling this.\n\n**1. The Cost Projection:** The agent is complex. A single query (e.g., \"Summarize my team's activity on Project X vs. their quarterly goals\") requires a 4-5 call chain to GPT-4T (planning, tool-use 1, tool-use 2, synthesis, etc.). We're clocking this at **\\~$0.75 per query**.\n\nThe feature will roll out to **\\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \\*(1,000 DAUs \\* 5 queries/day \\* 20 workdays \\* $0.75/query) = **\\~$75,000/month.**\\*\n\nThis turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?\n\n**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).\n\nWe're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an \"Enterprise\" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a \"Pro\" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n* Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce \"ping-pong\"?\n* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a \"pre-LLM\" validation layer?\n* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?\n\nWould appreciate any architecture or strategy insights. Thanks!",

It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.\n\nThe positives of the role are as follows:\n- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)\n- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help\n- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.\n\nThe negatives are as follows:\n- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London\n- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.\n\nDue to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.\n\nI am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.\n\nWhat should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.\n\nWhat thoughts/advice do people have? Anything is appreciated, thanks!",

But the reality has been quite different.\n\nMost of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.\n\nFor example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.\n\nSame with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.\n\n\nI totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.\n\nNow I’m wondering:\nShould I stay another month and try to make the best of it,\nor resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?\n\nWould leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?\n\nHas anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?\nI’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.\n\n\nEdit\n\nAfter going through everyone’s advice here, I’ve decided not to quit the internship for now. Instead, I’ll focus more on self-learning and building consistency until I find a better opportunity.\nHonestly, this experience has been a rollercoaster — frustrating at times, but it’s also pushing me to think like a real data engineer. I’ve started enjoying those moments when, after hours of debugging and trial-and-error, I finally fix an issue without any senior’s help. That satisfaction is on another level\n\nThanks",

No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.\n\nThe idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.\n\n## What My Project Does\nYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:\n- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)\n- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)\n- Where the results should go\n- What to do when things succeed or fail\n\nSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.\n\n## Target Audience\n\n**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.\n**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.\n**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.\n\n## Current State\n- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)\n- Full type safety throughout\n- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)\n- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages\n- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams\n- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress\n\n## Looking for Contributors\nThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:\n- Extend Polars engine support\n- Build out transformation library\n- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and Databases\n\nCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)\n\nStar it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.\n\n---\nExample: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:\n\n```yaml\nworkflow:\n  id: product-cleanup-pipeline\n  description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data\n  enabled: true\n  \n  jobs:\n    - id: clean-products\n      description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data\n      enabled: true\n      engine_type: spark\n      \n      # Extract product data from CSV file\n      extracts:\n        - id: extract-products\n          extract_type: file\n          data_format: csv\n          location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/\n          method: batch\n          options:\n            delimiter: \",\"\n            header: true\n            inferSchema: false\n          schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json\n      \n      # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns\n      transforms:\n        - id: transform-clean-products\n          upstream_id: extract-products\n          options: {}\n          functions:\n            # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns\n            - function_type: dropDuplicates\n              arguments:\n                columns: []  # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates\n            \n            # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types\n            - function_type: cast\n              arguments:\n                columns:\n                  - column_name: price\n                    cast_type: double\n                  - column_name: stock_quantity\n                    cast_type: integer\n                  - column_name: is_available\n                    cast_type: boolean\n                  - column_name: last_updated\n                    cast_type: date\n            \n            # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output\n            - function_type: select\n              arguments:\n                columns:\n                  - product_id\n                  - product_name\n                  - category\n                  - price\n                  - stock_quantity\n                  - is_available\n      \n      # Load the cleaned data to output\n      loads:\n        - id: load-clean-products\n          upstream_id: transform-clean-products\n          load_type: file\n          data_format: csv\n          location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output\n          method: batch\n          mode: overwrite\n          options:\n            header: true\n          schema_export: \"\"\n      \n      # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle\n      hooks:\n        onStart: []\n        onFailure: []\n        onSuccess: []\n        onFinally: []\n```",

However, now in my day-to-day work, after two months on the job, I still hadn’t been assigned any tasks until recently. They’ve started giving me tasks related to Terraform — configuring and creating resources using Terraform with another platform. I’ve never done this before in my life. Wouldn’t this fall under the infrastructure team’s responsibilities? What’s the actual need for learning Terraform within the scope of data engineering? Thanks for your attention.",

It's **not production-ready**, just a sandbox for testing and learning.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* It has three Python data generators for a realistic mix:\n   1. **Transactional (CDC):** Simulates MySQL changes streamed via **Debezium** & **Kafka**.\n   2. **Clickstream:** Sends real-time JSON events to a cloud API.\n   3. **Ad Spend:** Creates daily batch CSVs (e.g., ad spend).\n* **Terraform** provisions the entire AWS stack (API Gateway, Kinesis Firehose, S3, Glue, Athena, and Lake Formation with pre-configured user roles).\n* **dbt** (running on Athena with Iceberg) transforms the data, and **Dagster** (running locally) orchestrates the dbt models.\n\nRight now, only the AWS stack is implemented. My main goal is to build this *same* platform in **GCP** and **Azure** to learn and compare them.\n\nI hope it's useful for anyone else who wants a full end-to-end sandbox to play with. I'd be honored if you took a look.\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/adavoudi/multi-cloud-data-platform](https://github.com/adavoudi/multi-cloud-data-platform) \n\nThanks!",

        "author": "bond_shakier_0",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m exploring the trade-offs between **database-level isolation** and **application/middleware-level serialisation**.\n\nSuppose I already enforce **per-key serial order** outside the database (e.g., productId) via one of these:\n\n- local **per-key locks** (single JVM),\n\n- a **distributed lock** (Redis/ZooKeeper/etcd),\n\n- a **single-writer queue** (Kafka partition per key).\n\nIn these setups, only one update for a given key reaches the DB at a time. Practically, the DB doesn’t see concurrent writers for that key.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. If serial order is already enforced upstream, does it still make sense to keep the DB at SERIALIZABLE? Or can I safely relax to READ COMMITTED / REPEATABLE READ?\n\n2. Where does **contention** go after relaxing isolation—does it simply move from the DB’s lock manager to my app/middleware (locks/queue)?\n\n3. Any **gotchas, patterns, or references** (papers/blogs) that discuss this trade-off?\n\n**Minimal examples to illustrate context**\n\n**A) DB-enforced (serialisable transaction)**\n\n```sql\nBEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;\n\nSELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = 42;\n-- if stock > 0:\nUPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 42;\n\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n**B) App-enforced (single JVM, per-key lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**\n\n```java\n// map: productId -> lock object\nLock lock = locks.computeIfAbsent(productId, id -> new ReentrantLock());\n\nlock.lock();\ntry {\n  // autocommit: each statement commits on its own\n  int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  if (stock > 0) {\n    exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  }\n} finally {\n  lock.unlock();\n}\n```\n\n**C) App-enforced (distributed lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**\n\n```java\nRLock lock = redisson.getLock(\"lock:product:\" + productId);\nif (!lock.tryLock(200, 5_000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {\n  // busy; caller can retry/back off\n  return;\n}\ntry {\n  int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  if (stock > 0) {\n    exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  }\n} finally {\n  lock.unlock();\n}\n```\n\n**D) App-enforced (single-writer queue), DB at READ COMMITTED**\n\n```java\n// Producer (HTTP handler)\nenqueue(topic=\"purchases\", key=productId, value=\"BUY\");\n\n// Consumer (single thread per key-partition)\nfor (Message m : poll(\"purchases\")) {\n  long id = m.key;\n  int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", id);\n  if (stock > 0) {\n    exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", id);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI understand that each approach has different failure modes (e.g., lock TTLs, process crashes between select/update, fairness, retries). I’m specifically after **when it’s reasonable to relax DB isolation** because order is guaranteed elsewhere, and how teams reason about the **shift in contention** and **operational complexity**.",

        "content": "Hi there, Data PM here.\n\nI recently joined a mid-sized growing SaaS company that has had many \"lives\" (business model changed a couple times), which you can *see* in the data model. Browsing our warehouse layer alone (not all the source tables are hooked up to it) you find dozens of schemas and hundreds of tables. Searching for what should be a standard entity \"Order\" returns dozens of tables with confusing names and varying content. Every person who writes queries in the company (they're in every department) complains about how hard it is to find things. There's a lack of centralized reference tables that give us basic information about our clients and the services we offer them (it's technically not crucial to the architecture of the tools) and each client is configured differently so running queries on all our data is complex.\n\nThe company is still growing and made it this far despite this, **so is it urgent to address this right now?** I don't know. But I'm concerned by my lack of ability to easily answer \"how many clients would be impacted by this Product change.\" (though I'm sure with more time I'll figure it out)\n\n**I pitched to head of Product that I dedicate my next year to focusing on upgrading the data models behind our core business areas**, and to do this in tandem with new Product launches (so it's not just a \"data review\" exercise), but I was met with the reasonable question of \"how would this impact client experience and your personal KPIs?\". The only impact I can think of measuring is reduction in hours spent by eng and data on sifting through things (which is not easy to measure), but cutting costs when you're a growing business is usually not the highest priority.\n\nMy question: **what are metrics have you used to justify data model reviews?** How do you know when a confusing model might be a problem and when?\n\nWelcome all thoughts - thank you!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm the author of [zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv) (https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n\\- the fastest and most versatile bare-metal real-world-CSV parser for any platform (including wasm)\n\n\\- also includes CLI that does sql querying, compare, count, desc(ribe), pretty, serialize, flatten, 2json, 2tsv, stack, 2db and more\n\n\\- [install](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv/blob/main/INSTALL.md) on any OS with brew, winget, direct download or other popular installer/package managers\n\n**Background:**\n\nzsv was built because I needed a library to integrate with my application, and other CSV parsers had one or more of a variety of limitations. I needed:\n\n\\- handles \"real-world\" CSV including edge cases such as double-quotes in the middle of values with no surrounding quotes, embedded newlines, different types of newlines, data rows that might have a different number of columns from the first row, multi-row headers etc\n\n\\- fast and memory efficient. None of the python CSV packages performed remotely close to what I needed. Certain C based ones such \\`mlr\\` were also orders of magnitude too slow. xsv was in the right ballpark\n\n\\- compiles for any target OS and for web assembly\n\n\\- compiles to library API that can be easily integrated with any programming language\n\nAt that time, SIMD was just becoming available on every chip so a friend and I tried dozens of approaches to leveraging that technology while still meeting the above goals. The result is the zsv parser which is faster than any other parser we've tested (even xsv).\n\nWith parser built, I added other parser nice-to-haves such as both a pull and a push API, and then added a CLI. Most of the CLI commands are run-of-the-mill stuff: echo, select, count, sql, pretty, 2tsv, stack.\n\nSome of the commands are harder to find in other utilities: compare (cell-level comparison with customizable numerical tolerance-- useful when, for example, comparing CSV vs data from a deconstructed XLSX, where the latter may look the same but technically differ by < 0.000001), serialize/flatten, 2json (multiple different JSON schema output choices). A few are not directly CSV-related, but dovetail with others, such as 2db, which converts 2json output to sqlite3 with indexing options, allowing you to run e.g. \\`zsv 2json my.csv --unique-index mycolumn | zsv 2db -t mytable -o my.db\\`.\n\nI've been using zsv for years now in commercial software running bare metal and also in the browser (for a simple in-browser example, see https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/), and we've just tagged our first release.\n\nHope you find some use out of it-- if so, give it a star, and feel free to post any questions / comments / suggestions to a new issue.\n\n[https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)",

How do I deal best with this type of data as a data engineer? Putting data into a quarantine time agreed upon with the owner of the data source, and only publishing it after? If data changes significantly, models need to be re-run, which can be very time consuming.\n\nFor data exploration, the time series + location data are displayed in a hydrological application, while a basic interface would probably suffice. We'd need a simple interface to display all of these time series (also deducted ones, in total maybe 5k), point locations and polygons, and connect them together. What applications would you recommend? With preference managed applications, and otherwise simple frameworks with little maintenance. Maybe Dash + TimescaleDB / PostGIS?\n\nWhat other theory could be valuable to me in this job and where can I find it?\n\n",

Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. \n\nI’ll give you an example to follow.\nI have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. \nNow some changes may appear in this operational table\n\n1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance\n2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example).  Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data\n3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. \n4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC\n5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing \n\nDid you encounter similar issues in your development? How did you tackle it?\n\nAlso, if you have any advices that you want to share related to your experience with CDC, it will be more than welcomed. \n\nThanks, and sorry for the long post\n\nNote: I use Sql Server",

I see this most in two places: 1) the semantic layer and 2) the control plane.\n\nOn the first point, if AI writes SQL and its answers aren't correct for whatever reason - different names for data elements across the data stack, different definitions for the same metric - this is where a semantic model comes in. It's basically giving the LLM the context to create the right results. \n\nOn the second point, it seems data infrastructure and AI infrastructure are collapsing into one control plane. For example, analytics are now agent-facing, not just customer-facing. This changes the requirements for data processing. Quality and lineage checks need to be available to agents. Systems need to meet latency requirements that are designed around agents doing analytic work and retrieving data effectively. \n\nHow are y'all seeing this show up? What steps are y'all taking when implementing these semantic data models? Which metrics, context, and ontology are you providing to the LLMs to make sure results are good?",

The idea actually came after watching my brother reorder a DataFrame with more than a thousand columns and realizing the only solution he could find was to write a script to generate the new column list and paste it back in. That felt like something pandas should make easier.\n\nThe library helps with swapping columns, moving multiple columns before or after others, pushing blocks to the front or end, sorting columns by variance, standard deviation or correlation, and grouping them by dtype or NaN ratio. All helpers are typed, validate column names and work with `inplace=True` or `df.pipe(...)`.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols](https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols)\n\nI’d love to know:\n\n• Does this overlap with utilities you already use or does it fill a gap?  \n• Are the APIs intuitive (`move_after(df, [\"A\",\"B\"], \"C\")`, `sort_columns(df, by=\"variance\")`)?  \n• Are there features, tests or docs you’d expect before using it?\n\n  \nAppreciate any feedback, bug reports or even “this is useless.”  \nThanks!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.\n\nFor context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.\n\nI use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.\n\nCurrently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.\n\nThere is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.\n\nMy idea: \n\nStep 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.\n\nStep 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the \"reporting\" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization only\n\nMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.\n\nMy points to go for step 2:\n- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)\n- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance\n- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed\n- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)\n- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased \n\nAnything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",

        "author": "TheOnlinePolak",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work in a Databricks environment, so that’s my main frame of reference. Between Databricks Apps (especially the new Node.js support), the addition of transactional databases, and the already huge set of analytical and ML tools, it really feels like Databricks is becoming a full-on data powerhouse.\n\nA lot of companies already move and transform their ERP data in Databricks, but most people I talk to complain about every ERP under the sun (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, etc.). Even just extracting data from these systems is painful, and companies end up shaping their processes around whatever the ERP allows. Then you get all the exceptions: Access databases, spreadsheets, random 3rd-party systems, etc.\n\nI can see those exception processes gradually being rebuilt as Databricks Apps. Over time, more and more of those edge processes could move onto the Databricks platform (or something similar like Snowflake). Eventually, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Databricks or partners offer 3rd-party templates or starter kits for common business processes that expand over time. These could be as custom as a business needs while still being managed in-house.\n\nThe reason I think this could actually happen is that while AI code generation isn’t the miracle tool execs make it out to be, it *will* make it easier to cross skill boundaries. You might start seeing hybrid roles. For example a data scientist/data engineer/analyst combo, or a data engineer/full-stack dev hybrid. And if those hybrid roles don't happen, I still believe simpler corporate roles will probably get replaced by folks who can code a bit. Even my little brother has a programming class in fifth grade. That shift could drive demand for more technical roles that bridge data, apps, and automation. \n\nWhat do you think? Totally speculative, I know, but I’m curious to hear how others see this playing out.",

They were the ones who could think clearly about problems.\n\n  \nWhen you learn to:\n\n* Define the problem before touching the keyboard\n* Explain your code out loud and make it sound simple\n* Name things precisely\n* Question assumptions instead of patching symptoms\n\n...you start writing code that lasts, scales, and earns trust.\n\n  \nIf you're early in your journey, here's my best advice:\n\n* Don't chase tools, chase understanding.\n* Don't fear being wrong, fear not learning from it.\n* Don't copy patterns blindly, know why they exist.\n\nEverything else.. frameworks, AI tooling, languages will follow naturally.  \n\n\n*What's something you've learned the hard way that changed how you code?*",

        "author": "RockaBabyDarling",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nI shared this with some of my most senior software developer buddies and they said dude you need to share this again but in a better time window where more people will see it because it got lost too soon, so I'm doing that. I know I could probably go look at several analytics websites but I feel like midday on Saturday is probably a good time. The rest is my original post.\n\nI've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.\n\nIf you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.\n\nI've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.\n\nIf you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:\n\n**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**\n\nTake as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as \"you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,\" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, \"Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,\" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.\n\n**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**\n\nDo some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.\n\n**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**\n\nMany people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.\n\n**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself \"what was I thinking here?\" then you're not growing.**\n\nDon't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.\n\nLastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking \"okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,\" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.\n\nSo if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.",

I used to struggle a lot, but once I started doing things the right way and really learning, I realized how much I enjoy it. And that’s why this attitude around me is so frustrating, people treating this field like a shortcut to a paycheck while trashing the craft itself. Even if I ended up working at McDonald's someday, I’d still come home and code or do math for fun.

I want to build a version that's privacy focused and can only find images already owned by the user.\n\nWhat data structures or open source libraries would be necessary for that high-speed, distributed face vector comparison? Any advice on tackling the vector database architecture is needed!",

Instead of helping, it sometimes demotivates me, because it feels like AI is already better at the part I am trying to learn.\n\nSo now I am wondering:\n\n* Is this normal for early devs?\n* Does architecture/ code structure  come with experience, or do people actually study it as a separate skill?\n* How do you practice code architecture when you do not even know what a good one looks like?\n* Is relying on AI for structure a bad habit, or is it just the new normal?\n\nI do not use AI to write the full code, only the skeleton, and even that already results in something way cleaner than what I would design myself.\n\nHow did I bridge this gap?\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks everyone for the inputs. I think my main issue comes from my history of working in early stage startups where I had to come up with architecture, design, and working code really quickly. The tight deadlines didn’t help either, and there was very little room for mistakes, I was expected to just make things work. That kind of environment made me dependent on AI and caused me to get demotivated easily and have imposter syndrome i believe.I’ll spend more time in my free hours building systems on my own without relying on AI  to fix this.",

So I have experience in Java and Python, but not really in depth and more at a basic level. What is the best way for me to become a full stack developer and get internships as quickly as possible? Which of these three courses would you recommend? \nThanks in advance🙏🙏\n",

        "content": "It is day 3 of trying to wrap my head around it and I'm feeling closer to the truth but still not quite there, looking for the final mental relay to click in this connection.\n\nI have no clue what \"monoids\" or \"endofunctors\" are supposed to be, nor do i care *yet*. This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.\n\nIn essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:\n\n* Purity\n* Chaining of operations / composition\n\nKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:\n\n* Monads wrap around other \"things\"\n* The \"thing\" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad\n   * This operation can also be a \"chain of operations\", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be \"one abstract step\" on the outside\n* Monads that \"do something\" (= arent simply context), like IO, are \"lazy\". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)\n* The \"result\" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval \"unwrapping\"\n* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants\n   * They always are 100% pure \"representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value\"\n   * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O\n   * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that \"runs\" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about \"in -> out\"\n\nIf all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not \"that difficult to understand\", so I have to have missed something, right?\n\nI guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both \"let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value\".",

        "author": "ZealousidealKale2042",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nThroughout my years of studying programming and work, I have always had the same question. I don't know how to properly find various tools and libraries.\n\nWhile developing projects or doing my work, I tend to use the simplest and most straightforward approaches, relying on old and time-tested techniques that are hard to ignore when learning programming.\n\nWhen faced with a problem or task, I turn to Google for a solution. I usually find one, but it's often not the most efficient or optimal solution. Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.\n\nEach time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.\n\nBut also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).\n\nMany of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, \"FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift.\" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?\n\nAnd this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.\n\nWhen I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.\n\nI find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.\n\nOften, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.\n\nAnd it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.\n\nThere is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.\n\nI understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.\n\nIn my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.\n\nTLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?\n\nI am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your help.",

        "content": "As I observe the rise of tools like Interview Coder, I find myself questioning the very concept of \"merit\" in the tech industry. When an AI can assist you during a live coding interview by providing support with logic, syntax, and hints, can we truly claim we are testing merit, or are we merely assessing access to the right tools? Let’s face it: tech interviews have never been solely about skill. They have always been a complex mix of several factors:\n\n* How well you can recall patterns you studied the previous week,,\n* How fortunate you are with the problem set you receive, and,\n* How composed you can remain while someone observes your screen.,\n\nNow, with the introduction of AI tools, the fragility of this entire system is being exposed. If someone using Interview Coder performs like a top 1% developer, should we consider that \"cheating,\" or does it suggest that our interview process was never as robust as we thought? Perhaps the definition of merit is evolving from “I can solve this alone” to “I know how to use tools effectively.”",

Progrmming (Python)\n2. Signal processing\n3. Dsp simulation\n4. acoustic engineering\n5. psychoacoustics\n6. Spatial Audio / HRTF\n7. Coordinates → Audio Mapping\n\n\n\nI studied Python through YouTube lectures, but I didn't fully understand it.\n\nI’m currently studying “Think Dsp” and I’m understanding it one by one by following the examples and adding my own comments.\n\nI’m trying to somehow get used to Python and the computer language system.\n\n\n\nI thought, Instead of following an example, why not just write the code from scratch?\n\nBut I'm afraid it'll take too much time.\n\nImpatience comes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n**This is the one thing I really want to know.**\n\nHow much of the basics should I study before starting a project?\n\nIs it better to start a project right away, even if I know nothing?\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I'm on the right track right now, so I'm honestly asking for help.\n\n\n\nI took a year off from university to study on my own.\n\nBut I had no one to talk to about these things\n\nEventually, I was trapped in my own world, talking to AI every day.\n\n\n\nThen I discovered Reddit,\n\nand I was genuinely moved seeing how people here give honest, caring advice to complete strangers.\n\nThat’s what gave me the courage to write this post.\n\n\n\nAnd someday, I hope to be someone who can give advice to people who are lost like me.\n\nI’m still inexperienced,  \nbut I believe your words can change the direction of my life.\n\nThank you, truly, for reading all of this.",

        "author": "Lotheye",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello. I come seeking advice.\n\n\n\nI'm attempting to make a game with C and Vulkan (no engine). It will be low scope. It has a low-mid poly aesthetic, fairly involved mechanics, and will be multiplayer, supporting a handful of servers with lobbies with a max pop of \\~16.\n\n\n\nI'm adequate with C, with a fairly robust knowledge of it's more advanced topics, although I know nothing of networking/multiplayer. Just from cursory research, I hear a lot of nightmare stories of how adding multiplayer could add years of dev time, compounded with using C, it is seen as potentially unfeasable unless you are some kind of savant, which I am not.\n\n\n\nNow, I did end up getting reasonably far from a first attempt, just implementing the foundations of Vulkan, having an interactable, 3D play area, and moderately advanced game state and mechanic stuffs. Then, my old computer shat the bed, so I am starting from scratch. So, I definitely can at least create the non-multiplayer aspects of the game, but multiplayer is defnitely the big hurdle. I am 100% completely willing to learn this as well.\n\n\n\nI want to tackle this in a smart way. My plan is to create a single player version first, with all the non-multiplayer related systems in it so that I can at least have a workeable product in case the multiplayer thing doesn't pan out. Yet, the code base will be designed in such a way as to use a simulated pseudo-server, so that I can both at least dip my toes into the water, and when I finally gain a working knowledge of complex networking/multiplayer using C, I can implement it without having to rewrite entire systems from scratch. I'm making this plan without knowing if this is even best practice for this kind of scenario, or workable at all.\n\n\n\nSo, am I being foolish here? Should I bother doing things this way, or should I just jump straight into the deep end and implement networking/multiplayer as I am learning it? Is my plan actually viable, or am I completely misunderstanding just what implementing networking/multiplayer looks like? Is this really such a giant headache with C, at my slightly above average skill level, that I should just not bother at all, and make the game single player?\n\n\n\nAs a short note, I understand that one of the canned responses is to just start with small projects first, but I have never worked this way. I said that I have adequate knowledge of C, but Python was my first language (C is my 4th), and I gained a sufficient mastery over it by doing the complete opposite of that piece of advice. Jumping into the deep end with my grand project of choice is how I learn best. I am just worried if multiplayer would be beyond me by making the development time balloon to the point of making it a non-viable option.",

        "content": "Hello, I'm here to ask a question regarding roadmap organization for a coding project we are working on (a social media one). Keep in mind that preferably we would want a method that isn't blocked behind a paywall, and that we want good habits in terms of organization to form early since we are still teenagers. Also, I'd appreciate it if the UI for the method is easy to understand and intuitive :)  \n  \nCurrently, we have a system on Notion (For reference \\`notion.com/templates/notion-projects-and-tasks\\` ) in which we can a list of tasks and each bunch is separated by a \"project\" which is basically a topic like frontend, backend, note taking, etc. This method is cool, as in it's simple to use and we can very easily add on to each section in their own right. However, this method doesn't have much structure, meaning there's just a bunch of task without any organization of what to do in which order, or any \"branching off\" with tasks in the project that are related to each other. Essentially, it's just a pile of tasks.  \n  \nWhat we want is a roadmap-based system which we branch out into separate categories (UI, Authentication, Communication, etc.) and in each category, we have a linear roadmap which shows each tasks to do in sequence, each task with it's own note or page where we can either add extra mini \"sub-tasks\" to do and comments about our progress and so on and so forth. In such a way where it like creates a pathway of tasks, each task being it's own branch on the tree that connects to others so it gives us a nice flow on what should be done. You know just like standard roadmap but still with great organization, task management and all. At least that's what we invision as being good  \n  \nHaving said that, this is what we are sort of thinking of. But we are young and do not know as much as you other smarter people. So I implore honestly, what would be best? Notion, \\*\\*Clickup, Jira, Asana\\*\\* system and software? We know only so much, being young and inexperienced so whatever I am to say a suggestion probably won't mean too much except perhaps that we would like to have a lot of details and good organization.  \n  \nThat's all!

I went all-in on the frontend, but I completely botched the backend and now I'm stuck. I could really use some advice on how to dig myself out of this hole.\n\nWhat I Built (The Good part): · Tech Stack: React Native, TypeScript, React Native Reanimated · The Look: A custom iOS 26 \"Liquid Glass\" inspired UI. · The Feel: Buttery 60fps animations, a type-safe codebase with zero errors, and optimized transitions. · Status: The entire frontend is basically done. It's a high-fidelity prototype. I can even show you a screen recording of how smooth it is.\n\nWhere I Failed (The ugly part ):\n\n· The Mistake: I started coding with ZERO backend design or data model. I just started putting stuff in Firestore as I went along. · The Stack: Firebase Auth & Firestore. · The Problem: My database structure is a complete mess. It's not scalable, the relationships between users, universities, professors, and reviews are tangled, and I'm now terrified to write more queries because nothing makes sense anymore. I basically built a beautiful sports car with a lawnmower engine.\n\nWhat I’m blabbing about is:\n\n1.\t⁠How do I approach untangling this? Do I just nuke the entire Firestore database and start over with a clean plan?\n2.\t⁠What are the key questions I should be asking myself when designing the data structure for an app like this?\n3.\t⁠Are there any good resources (articles, videos) on designing Firestore structures for complex relational data?\n4.\t⁠If you were to sketch a basic data model for this, what would the top-level collections be and how would they relate?\n\nInfact what should be my best approach to transitioning to backend then to a Fullstack Developer? I learned a ton about frontend development, but this was my brutal lesson in the importance of full-stack planning. Any guidance you can throw my way would be a lifesaver.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I got an okay severance but used that and my unemployment to keep me afloat and not homeless for ~6 months. I quit drinking at that time and interviewed for a few jobs.\n\nAfter two final rounds for a couple jobs and not getting it both times, i’ve basically been frozen. I can’t do the interviews, i can barely even bring myself to apply anymore. I thought it would be easier being sober but it’s like my subconscious is trying to sabotage me because of how truly awful it was in those final months of employment. Here i am, 2 years later, and i’m not even sure if it’s possible for me to get a job anymore when i’ve got a two year gap. \n\nI’m borderline homeless, staying with family, and i’m kind of sick of it. Delivering uber eats destroyed my car in this time that i literally just cashed out my old 401k, the absolute last of my savings.

I feel like a failure and literally don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I had wanted this career since i was a child. What do you do when your dream job eviscerates your mental health?

        "author": "queenoyster",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "https://imgur.com/a/iRI5FRT\n\nI wanted to share my experience interviewing for the past two months in this market.  \n\nI have a Bachelors of Science in a field unrelated to computer science and graduated in 2020, straight into COVID-world. I'd taken a few computer science courses, so I spent my last semester of university looking for software engineer roles knowing we were probably going to be remote for a while.\n\nI've been working for five years, with most of that time at Amazon. I've been a mid-level engineer for roughly 1.5 years, but feel that I should've been promoted sooner. Despite what people say about working at Amazon, I've enjoyed my four years here. I lucked out with finding a good team and manager.\n\nMy main reasons for leaving are:\n\n- Amazon comp philosophy is bad. You are assigned stock to meet a target compensation number, with the assumption that the stock will increase 15% YoY. The stock has actually gained 10% YoY since I've started, which means I'm paid less than my target. The solution to this is Amazon assigns more stock that vests the following years to make up for the gap. This means you'd have to stay longer to meet your target compensation. The reverse is also true. If your actual compensation surpasses your target because of stock gains, then you are assigned fewer/no additional stock vests for the next few years. The employee loses when the stock does well and when the stock does poorly.\n- Layoffs were coming. The volume of posts about layoffs occurring later this year dramatically increased across Blind, internal Slack, r/amazonemployees, various Discords, etc. Morale was already bad since we did two layoffs prior to 2025.\n- My work was getting stale.\n- I felt there was no path to senior for me in the next four years.\n- I distrust my org's leadership.\n- I'm in Seattle for Amazon and I've accepted it's not my city. I'd like to move to New York City or San Francisco.\n\nMost of the jobs I applied to came from LinkedIn, but I applied manually through the employer's website. I targeted midlevel engineering roles if they were available, otherwise, I applied for senior. Towards the tail end of my job search, I used a browser extension called Simplify to autofill applications. I highly recommend this since you can also use it to keep track of your applications, scrum board style. I spread out my applications so that I would have interviews for the two following weeks.\n\nTo prepare for my interviews, I bought a year of Leetcode premium and a lifetime subscription to HelloInterview premium. I also joined a Slack server targeted towards engineering leadership career development and participated in mock interviews there. My friends generously offered their time to mock interview me as well. These were great because they gave me very candid feedback. I also searched through Glassdoor for other peoples' interview experiences to get an idea of what to expect for companies I was highly interested in. My weakest round is probably the coding round; I completed 160 Leetcode during this interview cycle and felt that was sufficient. I should note that I would've practiced more Leetcode if I were interviewing with large tech companies like Google or Microsoft, but I didn't hear back from them. I also had never done a system design interview before this job application cycle, so I studied that hard. I read every HelloInterview system design article and felt I overprepared.\n\nManaging emotions around rejection was pretty difficult, I'm thankful I have good friends I could talk to. I got rejected from my top 3 target companies and I bedrotted for weeks beating myself up over it. If I were to have done anything different, I would've front-loaded my interviews with companies I cared less about. I felt much more comfortable in my later interviews. I also would've spaced out my interviews more. It was difficult balancing them and a full-time job. I tried to do early morning interviews (I even had two 2AM ones!), but found that my performance really suffered in the morning. I'd block out time in the afternoon instead to do interviews and pray no one at work wanted to schedule over them. I'd often work after hours to catch up on work I'd neglected during the day.\n\nI ended this interview cycle with 5 offers: 2 senior and 3 mid-level. Two of these offers were at late stage SF-based AI startups (not any of the big names). I accepted one of these. I don't want to reveal exact numbers, but I'll say that my base comp exceeds my total comp at Amazon, and I am extremely happy with it.",

I was laid off in the last week of 2024 and have been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for the past 10 months. I have 5 years of experience at a FAANG company and consider myself good at selling myself because I consistently make it to final interview rounds, but I’ve not landed a single offer all year. Now it’s November and I just got the ‘no offer’ emails after final rounds with two more companies (I think I have failed 12 final loops now). \n\nWhat do I do now? I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:\n- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews\n- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies \n- I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me\n- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything \n- I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviews\n\nAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciated\n\nEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying. I don’t normally post on social media but getting to discuss this anonymously with others has been very helpful. \n\nAs many have pointed out, my interview skills are not perfect, and I when I get feedback it’s generally about the system design round. While I can easily create a high level design and have used Hello Interview to practice, I still slip up when asked for low level details about components I haven’t worked with. ",

        "author": "JagoffAndOnAgain",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**tl;dr** 1. Paid an expert to redo my resume, and 2. Ignored LinkedIn/Indeed completely. Bookmarked and applied directly through company Careers/Jobs pages for brand new positions only.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, I was laid off from a full stack job I loved and was at for 9 years. The severance package provided some \"career coaching and resume assistance\" via Randstad. So I used them to redo my resume which I had always done entirely myself with no external help, including AI. I thought it was a lot better.\n\nI was wrong. Throughout the next 6 months in the spring and summer of 2023, I applied to 171 jobs (with 13 YoE at the time). I heard back from 12 (7%), was ghosted by 5 of those and rejected by 4 more. When I accepted my contract position, I ended two other interviews.\n\nCut to this summer 2025. I was thankful for the contract position but wasn't particularly interested in the domain. Also, I got cabin fever working remotely. My new apartment's home office is a lot sadder than the old one. I need to get out of the house and see the sun which I don't do when WFH. I totally understand why most people love WFH- I did it for years. It's just not great for me personally long term. For all this reasons, I began hunting despite the doom and gloom around the current job market.\n\nFor a few months, I stuck to my old habits. I added my current position to my resume but kept it basically the same as before. I applied to LinkedIn posts along with hundreds of other people. And I was back to my 2023 numbers. In fact, it was worse. I was only hearing back 5% of the time (which this time was only one job) and they ghosted me after one interview. Fuckers.\n\n---\n\n**1.** I realized I needed a change. I had a gut feeling my resume wasn't great. It wasn't getting me the first look. I'm a software engineer, not a resume expert. These are two entirely different skillsets. A younger me scoffed at the idea of resume writing being valuable: \"I write great code on cool systems, that should be easy enough for anyone to glean from my resume!\" Idiot. I searched \"software engineer resume coach\" and found one with great TrustPilot reviews. I spent $300 for someone to take my old resume, ask me clarifications, and return a brand new resume back to me about a week later.\n\nI cannot tell you how much of an upgrade the second resume is. The first one looks like dogshit by comparison. My old resume was a massive wall of text combining some tech keywords with the resume guidance of the late 2000's (my college era when I learned to write a resume). This new version had largely the same information, but it was presented in a much more impressive way. I was impressed by my own resume. It also surprisingly gave me a new sense of confidence going into interviews. It had way more metrics and quantitive points than I had on there.\n\nMy callback rate when from 5% to 25%. Post-resume glow up, I applied to 12 positions and heard back from 3. Pretty stunning turnaround.\n\nBut an improved resume wasn't the only thing I changed in this round of job hunting. I changed my application tactics.\n\n---\n\n**2.** In 2023 and part of my 2025 hunt, I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn applying to jobs according to filters and advanced searches. This just never felt particularly useful. You're adding another layer of software between your resume and a human being's eyes. Also, I just hate LinkedIn. People are so strange and phony on there. So I abandoned it.\n\nInstead, I started searching for lists of companies based in my city. I would then bookmark their Careers or Jobs pages in a folder in my browser. By the end of my hunt, I bookmarked about 55 pages. And a few times per week, I would spent about half an hour looking at every single one.\n\nI was looking for jobs posted within the last 48 hours but ideally that day. If a day was posted longer than 3 days ago, I considered it a dead end. You want to be in the first 50 in a stack of resumes.\n\nJob posting aggregators are a wasteland. I think these days HR looks at the stack of applications in their domain first, then looks to LinkedIn and Indeed if they see nothing promising.\n\n---\n\nWith these two tactics, I interviewed with a few places, narrowed it down to two, and chose the one I was most excited about. It's been off to a good start so far.\n\nAnyways, that is my advice from my past few years of job hunting in the frustrating market/economy/country/existence. Good luck!\n\nWhen I posted this to r/experienceddevs I got accused of being an ad almost instantly, so FYI I will not be recommending the resume service I used. Just search around and I'm sure you'll find someone capable. This is merely advice for what seemed to work for me.",

Most companies that were listed on stock exchanges 100 years ago are *gone*. Many tech stocks today have high P/E ratios and other indicators that suggest they are overvalued. If the AI bubble bursts, it is highly likely that your company's stock will take a hit, regardless of how you perceive their level of exposure to that area.\n\nImagine having a large percentage of your net worth tied up in one stock you picked.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m about six months into my first full-time software engineering job at Apple, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.\nI also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.\n\nFor example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.\n\nI also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.\n\nLately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.\n\nWhat really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc  — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind? Is this normal? Are there courses, books, or resources that helped you connect the dots and understand the bigger picture of how software systems work in practice?\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

        "content": "Note: Do not tell me to not try and I'm doomed - even if its impossible its better that I make an effort and learn something than not\n\nI have been unemployed for 7 months as a an ex-bootcamper (non-stem bachelors) with 3 yoe. My last job was in a big household name company but not one known for tech (more publishing) in Java. I never felt I was more than mediocre, and then I got sick with nebulous undiagnosable long covid, which made my performance worse, and I became an easy budget cut. \n\nAfter a few months of inactive burnout (where I lost a lot of muscle memory), and a few months of sending out CVs, I had pretty much given up on getting any significant interviews any time soon and was pretty much just messing around with ones I didn't care about and building my portfolio as much as possible, with an aim of just learning out loud and then leveraging that in my next round of applying. I was making a language learning app with some NLP elements in python for the last couple months. I haven't written much Java since April, and even then, my last position was fullstack and they had me on a lot of frontend in the final year. I haven't done any leetcode since June (and most DSA I haven't revisited since I got hired at my last place >2 years ago). Studying up on the systems design I'm starting to be expected to understand better as a now potential mid was in my backlog.\n\nSuddenly, two days ago I got an email from a big tech company (not FAANG but close, and in an adjacent field to my last company) I had applied to a month or more ago. I remember filling in the application form thinking \"I don't know why I am doing this, I should definitely wait until I have improved myself and have an actual chance. They're going to think this application is pathetic\". I expected no response and honestly forgot entirely about the job position or what I even wrote in that form. \n\nThey want to interview me for a Java position.\n\nI can only assume they saw how my last company is actually vaguely relevant to their product and clicked on my github and saw how active I am rn and actually wanted to give me a chance.\n\nI have accepted, have HR on Tuesday, I'm just trying to work out how to get myself in gear in time for the next stage if it happens. Currently revisiting all of DSA on leetcode and doing problems but I'm unsure I can manage to internalise this stuff in time... Plus there are other elements like SD that I need to look over.\n\nHow would you strategise going about this? Have any of you been in a similar situation and given it your best shot? Lmk\n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So for some context, I would not consider myself old school by any means. I started learning to code with Java back in 2017, so I learned to code \"the old-fashioned way\" by looking at documentation and/or stack overflow before AI came into the mainstream.\n\nI now work in test automation primarily using C#, but I also have quite a bit of experience with Python as well. I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like \"My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now.\" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.\n\nWhen you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you? In my experience it seems to be good at things like leetcode, but bad in large codebases with dependencies and structure.\n\nEdit: From these responses it seems like most of you use AI basically the same way I do, with the exception of the cursor comments. Unfortunately I’m in a corporation so switching to cursor and trying it out isn’t really feasible for me in this context. Maybe I’ll give it a try on my own and see how it does for a side project. ",

Any newly invented tool/process is assumed to be a must-have, no matter how shitty or irrelevant it is, then puts it in the requirement.\n3. Requires \"expertise\" in unproven or immature areas of technology\n4. Requires extensive experience in super niche areas that has only popular within the recent year. Then even asking for a certificate or even degree.\n5. \"N many years of experience\" is a must. So if the requirement is 6 years but you only have 5.75 years, then auto-disqualified.\n6. Asks for corporate experience from fresh grads.\n7. Worse, ask for both extensive commercial as well as extensive academic experiences. Especially, in data science/ML. \"Cool, you simple baseline model bring X revenue? But did you also spend amount of time outside main work for reading academic paper about new algo ?...\" or \"Tell me the interesting academic paper you've read recently...\". While a lot of time simple baseline in production out-performs the complexity in the long run. Probably \"we need the complexity to sell our solution to be relevant...\"\n8. Even worse, for corp job, asking for academic publication; have no clue if the pub is high quality or not\n\nThis list is just at surface level. Don't even mention the mid process as well. Answers must be correct for some arbitrary standard. One wrong and you're out.

        "author": "PentaSector",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all. Apologies for the long post. Mainly want to be thorough to emphasize the efforts I've made and the scope of the problem.\n\nSo, I manage a small squad of devs on a larger project team and maintain a full-time dev workload alongside them. (I know what you're thinking, and you're right, but I've accepted the challenge for the sake of my trajectory.)\n\nThis is my first managerial role; I was deliberately given less advanced devs, partly to mentor them and help boost their professional development, partly to shield them from aggressive technical leadership. I was fine with that assignment; it plays to my strengths as a mentor and safe space steward. I do what I can to foster collaboration and self-organization - we have\n\n* a chat channel just for my reports and me (i.e., a space to screen \"stupid\" questions before asking the wider team, etc.)\n* regular meetings to check up on work status and collaborate on blockers in real time\n* 1:1 and 1:few meetings to get people comfortable and talking through obstacles\n* me frequently working to communicate thought process to the team through detailed code reviews, driving on pair/group programming sessions, and brainstorming out loud during aforementioned meetings\n\nBasically, I'm doing everything I can to not only get people working together, but also to make sure they see the work through my eyes as much as I can verbalize my process.\n\nI'm confident in asserting that I'm putting forth disproportionate effort in getting them somewhere closer to my level. My efficiency suffers for it, but leadership is generally happy with my velocity, and I'm still significantly more efficient than the rest of the team. Some of them are legitimately junior and gradually ramping up, but a few have more YoE than I do and frequently submit incomplete, incorrect, or arguably badly engineered solutions (acknowledging that the latter is somewhat subject to my opinions, but it's also the least of my worries). This manifests in incredibly frustrating ways, like having to talk through the same technical guidance or arguments repeatedly as people continue to make the exact same mistakes, and having to frequently repeat what strikes me as obvious advice to solve refactoring or bugfixing problems (e.g., if you're trying to correlate a code path to a navigation path within a web app, start with a known related unit of code and follow the references). Tl;dr: lack of curiosity seems to be a major factor.\n\nThese are the kinds of problems that resulted in me being stepped up to manage these devs, and the lack of improvement is felt across the wider team. This manifests pretty clearly in the fact that we estimate our own roadmap and have decent leeway to do so, and the devs aren't even meeting their own numbers when they get the padding they argue for. We're essentially not at liberty to stretch our roadmap much further, just given the dependencies on our output, so when we fall behind on our own estimates, it's a problem, and people come under scrutiny.\n\nI was recently asked to pull the tech lead into one of our regular meetings - one where mob coding is a frequent engagement - to help gauge the situation. After sitting in on a few rounds, his assessment was that I'm doing enough of the work that they ultimately have no need to be curious when I drive, and he's right. Anytime the devs pull me aside, it turns into me taking the cockpit and talking through how I work; I always let them start, but I usually take over *because* they essentially hit a point where they're just lost or out of ideas, including in the context of obstacles we've specifically worked through before.\n\nHis proposed solution was to start letting them fail immediately. There's a version of this that I can get on with, but this work environment is not particularly tolerant of the kind of \"failure\" it would entail, and I don't want to put anybody's job at risk.\n\nSo my question is essentially this:\n\n**What's a graduated approach I can take to get people working more independently that gives willing devs a chance and respects my time?**\n\nI don't foresee something like purposely tracking my collab hours and tuning them down each week; that'll never hold up. I *have* contemplated cutting all collab hours and letting code review be our only touchpoint. The problem here is that several devs don't seem to internalize review feedback, and PR churn sometimes results in exponential loss of time. E.g., they may submit a PR after one day but take two more to fix relatively simple issues. I'm essentially looking for a way to provide detailed, immediate feedback that they *will* internalize, while keeping my time burden for that sort of effort stable and eventually decreasing.\n\nMoreover, **what's a way to do this that doesn't leave people feeling demoralized or traumatized?** I'm clearly frustrated, but these are still people, and I don't want to make their lives hard. I just want to see them perform to their potential.\n\nOpen to any insights regarding successful approaches that folks have taken here to empower and motivate their teams, especially if starting from a place of subpar performance.\n\nAlso feel free to ask clarifying questions or hurl clarifying insults; there's surely a lot of context I'm leaving out here, probably in part just because I'm fixating on solving the problem more than thinking broadly around it.\n\n**EDIT:** remove a rogue instance of the word \"I'm.\"",

I taught myself front-end development in 2017 while living off savings, and during that time I started using weed heavily to cope with stress. It turned into a long-term dependency. I’m not functional when high. My focus and code quality drop  and that has definitely slowed my growth. I’ve also struggled with anxiety and burnout cycles along the way.\n\nMy first job was rough: I was the only front-end dev, no mentorship, no code reviews, just figuring things out alone. Since then, I’ve mostly worked in digital agencies doing CMS-heavy work. I’ve stayed employed and I can ship features, but I feel like my foundational skills never solidified. **My code works, but the quality often isn’t good** it feels like I’m assembling things rather than understanding them at a deeper level (architecture, state management, patterns, testing, etc.).\n\nOn top of that, **my career progression has been slow and has gaps field with very questionable freelance work.** Some people move from junior to senior/tech lead in 3–4 years. In my case, after \\~7–8 years, I’ve only just reached mid-level. I know why — lack of mentorship, inconsistent learning habits, mental health struggles, and the weed dependency but it still leaves me with the fear of becoming *stuck* or even **unemployable** if I don’t level up soon.\n\nI’m trying to cut down on weed, rebuild discipline, and take my growth seriously. But I’m overwhelmed and unsure how to structure the path.\n\n**I’d really appreciate advice on:**\n\n1. **How to improve code quality** when you didn’t develop good habits early on?\n2. **How to rebuild fundamentals mid-career** — patterns, architecture, testing — in a structured way?\n3. **How to break out of the “just making things work” mindset** and develop more intention in coding?\n4. **For anyone who has dealt with weed dependence / burnout:** what helped you actually regain clarity and momentum?\n5. **How to focus** when everything feels important and the learning path feels endless?\n\nNot looking for pity, just experiences from people who’ve been through similar and found a way to turn things around.\n\nThanks to anyone who takes the time to reply.",

I realized that articulating my work clearly is just as important as doing the work itself.\n\nMy only concern is that as time goes on, my gap gets larger.

        "author": "HYV_Empathy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For context, I'm 27m and I used to work as a team lead for high-level FE development (HTML/JS/CSS only work, basically). My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.\n\nAbout 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.\n\nPerfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.\n\nGoing from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.\n\nLately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.\n\nWe use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it. I keep trying to investigate issues, get stuck, reach out to a colleague only for them to say \"Oh, that's likely due to xyz\" when \"xyz\" never even crossed my mind.\n\nIt feels like I've been plateaued for months now, and I can't get past it. I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of \"When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology.\" along with \"Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.\"\n\nThis advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of. If I see \"Axios error 123\" or \"Apollo error: this is what's wrong...\" then brilliant! I can read the documentation!\n\nBut for more vague issues like \"This is our component that's nested in 13 other components, it's not working as intended, figure out why.\" I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).\n\nWhat I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.\n\nLately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to \"Acute stress reaction\" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.\n\nIt doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.\n\nI just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?\n\nP.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day. I wonder if that's relevant... /s",

I worked in tech in the US, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and visited China many times for work.\n\nTo various extents, I've seen the the development of AI, dot-com bubble (indirectly), big data boom, cloud revolution, the Bitcoin inception, the LLMs, and a few side-hypes like the quantum computing.\n\nI'm also well-aware of the overall crisis of science, especially with respect to publishing and funding, that spans far beyond the boundaries of Computer Science. Nevertheless, I would argue that no major scientific discipline is in a worse danger than CS, and I'm proceeding to expand on that.\n\nTech has generated an unprecedented amount of wealth over the last three decades. That wealth produced the political power that influenced the society. Unlike some other historically influential movements, this one chose an unsubtle method of societal influence that generates unprecedented amount of discontent, and therefore I denote the people who hold this power as \"moguls.\" Worse even for the tech community, the moguls hid their ideological underpinnings and political ambitions behind their \"tech nerd\" images.   \n  \nHistory teaches us that the majority of the upcoming backlash will center around the images the moguls perpetuate and not their chosen ideologies.   \n  \nAlthough one could argue that a scientific or engineering discipline may spontaneously evaporate upon fulfilling its historical role, I assume that CS is not at that stage. That is to say that there still exist problems that CS can help humanity with.\n\nUnder the above assumption, how do we defend CS (and tech) as a discipline once the \"shit hits the fan,\" pardon my French? How do we argue that it's not tech that is evil, but the ideologies fueling the tech moguls?",

I’m pursuing Senior SWE position(s). Through my recruiter screening and technical phone parts, I believe I’ve shown that I’m technically strong, and I think they know through my introductions that I haven’t mentored or led projects. That’s why I’m curious about what expectations I should anticipate when speaking with the hiring manager.\n\nThis market is tough, so I’m taking all the help I can get. I’m self-aware that socializing isn’t my strongest skill. In past hiring processes for SWE II roles, I tended to succeed at companies that emphasized LeetCode-style technical assessments. But at places where the behavioral portion carried weight, I often fell short—partly because I optimized only for the technical side.\n\nNow I’m focused on building strong behavioral stories. I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.\n\nOverall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager. I’m willing to invest significant time into this preparation since acing the behavioral round feels like a fixed cost in today’s market",

Maybe it’s just me but I feel like as soon as I receive feedback from a peer that’s somewhat negative, it means that I’ll have to wait again till next year to try again for a promotion.  \n\nDoes anyone feel this way as well?

For reference, I am a data engineer in the semi-conductor industry, and the number of times that I have worked on a project only to:\n\n1. Get held up by permissions and access constantly, and have to submit an IT ticket that gets put on the back burner for weeks.\n\n2. Find out that I need to use the approved by IT tools/resources which are often completely ass and hold no real world value, and hinder progress, because people making these decisions are looking at safety and budget, not actual function. Looking at you Power Automate flow, the worst platform I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life… all because my company won’t allow anyone not directly on the software team to create an actual web application outside of Power App and Power automate flow.\n\n3. Deal with management misunderstanding priorities and getting caught up on their grandiose visions of ML/AI which is just literally a buzz word at this point and they have no understanding of what is actually meant by these words. I had a boss that wanted me, by myself, to implement a way to monitor FSE’s , with AI, who are working on the tool to ensure they’re installing the parts outlined in procedures… sir… what?! He pressed us to do this for months despite telling him it isn’t attainable, and he just kept saying, “figure it out.” Until finally he left the he company.\n\n4. Management or stakeholders who want a detailed, image based, representation of every single change you accidentally mention instead of just making discretely. I had a manager for a while who, for example, in one meeting I mentioned I have to change the data type of a column on my not even proof of concept project yet, and he had me spend 6 days making DAGs, picture based PowerPoints, and tons of other documentation, because he wanted to understand better… this was a guy who bragged about lying on his resume to get a tech job management position and was previously just monitoring processes and creating tickets when processes failed for wafer runs in the fab…. Needless to say, he was shortly thereafter demoted lol.\n\nAnd so many other things.\n\nThe point is, exercise, go for walks, meditate, or some thing else to build resilience and clear your mind, and learn patience, because the biggest thing I have learned in the last 3-4 years in this industry is that you will run into so many absurd issues or requests that are in no way based in logic, and are purely emotional, and if you let it eat at you, it’s going to destroy your mental health, work relationships, etc.\n\nGodspeed y’all. \n\nEdit: I also want to emphasize, I am so grateful to have a job, I love my company, I love the management that I have most of the time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have worked here for 10 years now. I understand things could be significantly worse and I could be on tour in the infantry or something. I just wanted to touch on something that I think affects many people in this industry and they don’t get credit for it.",

The interviewing team rejected me for that particular role citing a lack of expertise in that area but recommended me for hire for similar roles in other areas. This is for Data Scientist roles.\n\nMy recruiter told me I am what they call a \"Podium Candidate\". We talked on Monday (3rd Nov) and he asked me to send him a few roles that I think I'll be a good fit for. I sent him 2 emails (Tue & Thur) and a couple texts yesterday (10th Nov) and I haven't heard back.\n\nHas anyone her ever been a podium candidate for Capital One? Given my recruiter has suddenly stopped responding, what do I do in this situation?",

        "content": "How do I grow from where I am? I feel either I’m losing steam or don’t have a defined plan, hence not truly working toward some goal.\n\nMy goal is simple — to get or be in a position where I am employable. But to make myself employable, I am either overwhelmed or do not have a clear direction on what to prioritize.\n\nI started my career late — I got a true programming job at 28 years old. Since then, I’ve been with my current employer doing Java and legacy C# development for six years. I started job hunting three years ago, on and off. It has been a learning experience since then — crafting my resume better and using the time to upskill in domains like cloud (Azure) and doing mini personal projects to gain exposure to different technologies.\n\nIn the past three years, I have gone through system design and done LeetCode. Lately, I’ve given up on LeetCode or lost motivation for it since I legitimately believe it’s not providing any real conversion. I have failed onsite not on LeetCode but on general full-stack knowledge — like authentication — or failed system design on “design of a job scheduler.” More importantly, since my day job doesn’t involve building projects from scratch and mostly focuses on enhancing legacy or large codebases, I don’t have real exposure to building, I guess.\n\nWhat can I realistically do right now? What should I prioritize as short-term and long-term goals? For the long term, I feel I’m either at a fork in the road or should use what I have so far and somehow leverage it. Since my background really isn’t related to true backend, DevOps, or cybersecurity — at its core, it’s just debugging and solving proprietary problems.\n\nAs I type this, I have headhunters reaching out and I have two CodeSignals to complete, but I just don’t feel motivated at all and feel like there’s been a massive waste of time — or that there’s something I’m doing wrong.\n\nWith that said, my thoughts for next steps are:\n\n1. Dive into the world of machine learning to gain exposure to another segment and see if it sticks with me or not.\n2. Get comfortable with React, which might open doors to building serious full-stack applications — this will give me much-needed hands-on experience in building and deploying solutions end to end. \n3. Pursue Azure Solution Architect/DevOps certification — there is an intermediate Azure certification that’s just boring AF, and I lose interest really fast. It deals with group policy and similar things — the stuff an Azure admin would do. Is this something a SWE should really know?\n4. Skip the whole machine learning world and try exploring MLOps — I found resources on Reddit. My biggest issue is that since they don’t have any certificate or real-life usage at my current workplace, my gut feeling is that after spending months and months, I’ll have nothing to show for it.\n\nGiven all this, with limited exposure in my day job, how do I leverage my current situation and make the most of it? As of now to 'grow', I will do item 2 since I am fairly comfortable getting the back-end working in either Java/Node.js and deploying to local VMs. Deploying to K8S will be interesting task.\n\nBefore other folks say it, I should mention transferring to another role within the org is not possible. It will reset promo cycle. \n\n  \nSome days, I feel my life would be so much easier if I had just worked at FAANG - it might be fallacy but perhaps working there automatically drives your career to the next level. But as of now, I am not that talented with LC at all. I suffer from ADHD which might be another issue.",

We’re a small startup, so official roles are flexible, but the opportunities are starting to open up - and now I’m stuck between two paths: Technical Product Management or Backend Development.\n\n**My background:**\n\n* Currently a CX Specialist Level 3 (promoted twice)\n* No formal CS degree, but I’ve built a few Python tools and scripts\n* Work closely with our Senior PM and engineering team\n\n**Path 1: Technical Product Management**\n\n* I’ve been shadowing and collaborating with our Senior PM for over a year\n* Used my learning stipend to take a semester-long PM foundations course\n* I’ve written PRDs, participated in spikes, backlog grooming, and customer research\n* Haven’t fully owned an end-to-end product cycle yet\n\n**Path 2: Backend Development**\n\n* Mostly self-taught\n* Helped customers onboard using a Python import tool our dev team made - ended up saving dev time and even got public recognition for it\n* I have a personal project in Python that I'm working on right now, and if I hit pay dirt, it'll be a big step towards moving into Backend\n* I really enjoy the logic/problem-solving side of engineering\n\n**Other context:**\n\n* I’m already comfortable poking around backend tools like Kibana, Datomic, and JSON APIs when needed\n* Our company currently needs more backend developers, especially with a new AI product in development\n* Backend feels like it has a clearer career ladder (EM, Architect, DevOps, etc.)\n* I’m less sure what the long-term growth of a Technical PM looks like at a smaller startup\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMid-level CX employee at a startup deciding between moving into Technical Product Management or Backend Development. I like both, but Backend feels more interesting, in-demand, and scalable long-term. PM aligns better with my current relationships and experience, but the growth path feels less defined.\n\n**If you were in my position, which path would you choose - and why?**",

I guess I always just assumed design is for naturally creative people who have an interest in that stuff.\n* In mid 40s now, and gone back into a fulltime job as fullstack dev recently, but not enjoying it after being so used to having my freedom most of my career.\n* I like working on my own big complex solo projects, but not working on big shared codebases and/or in teams.\n  * I've got ADHD, which is a big differentiator here... no problem cranking 30 hours on my own projects, but staying motivated & focused on team projects is very hard... I'm constantly \"whinging/arguing in my head\" about things I don't like in the codebase, which I know is unproductive, but I can't help it.\n* I'm considering going back to being self-employed, and maybe learning to design sites myself, so I can do everything myself, rather than being more limited to backend dev, and relying also not relying on wordpress themes for the design side.\n* Wondering if anyone else had made this kind of change?  i.e. more techie-minded people who weren't interested in design (or even frontend) for a long time, but went and learnt it anyway to run their own small webdev agencies?\n  * Typically I've taken on these small site jobs, and just throw together in Wordpress (not a fan)... mainly because of the themes available (seeing I'm not a designer)... my theory here is that I'd instead build something closer to static sites with React (stack that I like), and learn the design side so I can at least design pretty standard brochureware business sites for clients.\n  * None of my clients that I've built wordpress sites for ever actually use the control panel to edit stuff themselves (and I hate having to edit stuff in wordpress for them), so I'm thinking of just charging a bit more for the hosting, and including updates in those ongoing fees.\n* I don't mind dealing with clients and all that \"soft skills\" side of business, chasing invoices etc... plenty of experience with it mostly being self-employed... and much prefer handling that myself than dealing with vague requirements passed through communication-by-proxy in bigger companies.\n  * What I'm seeking advice/anecdotes about here is more just the \"learning to design\" side for anyone with a similar techie background.  ... how feasible is it?
