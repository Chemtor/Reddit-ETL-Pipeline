To be honest regardless of the the fivetran acquisition, dbt-core never got any improvement over time. And it always neglected community contributions. \n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) fork is created to solve this problem. Enabling community to extend dbt to their own needs and evolve opensource version and make it feature rich.\n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) dynamically extends dbt-core. It's already adding significant features that aren't in the dbt-core. This is a path toward a complete community-driven fork.\n\nWe are inviting developers and the wider data community to collaborate. \n\nPlease check out the features we've already added, star the repo, and feel free to submit a PR! \n\n[https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt)",

Maybe 1000 rows. \n\nWhat is strategy for such joins in database.  We have been using just a dedicated program written in c++ that just holds all that data in memory.  Downside is that it involves custom coding, no sql, just is implemented using vectors and hash tables. Other downside is if this server goes down it takes some time to reload all the data.  Also machine needs lots of ram.  Upside is the query is very fast.\n\nI understand a type of aggregate materialized view could be used.  But this doesn’t seem to work if clauses added to where. Would work for a whole join though.\n\nWhat are best techniques for such joins or what end typically used ?\n\n",

Our team's trying to build out our analytics infrastructure and our IT department has set up **completely separate environments** for DEV, UAT, and PROD including:\n\n* Separate Snowflake accounts for each environment\n* Separate managed Airflow deployments for each environment\n* GitHub monorepo with protected branches (dev/uat/prod) for code (In fact, this is what I asked for. IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)\n\nThis setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:\n\n* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing\n* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated\n* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in Snowflake\n\nI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.\n\n# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:\n\n* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?\n* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?\n* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support\n* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to  generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?\n\nAgain, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful. \n\nThanks in advance for any insights and enjoy your rest of Sunday!",

Data Products contextualize dims/descriptive data, in the context of the product, and as such they might not need a MDM tool to master it at the full/edw/firm level.\n2. Anything with \"Master blah Mgmt\"  w/r/t Modern Data ecosystems overall is probably dead just out of sheer organizational malaise, politics, bureaucracy and PMO styles of trying to \"get everyone on board\" with such a concept, at large.\n3. Even if you bought a tool and did MDM well - on core entities of your firm (customer, product, region, store, etc..) - I doubt IT/business leaders would dedicated the labor discipline to keeping it up. It would become a key-join nightmare at some point.\n4. Do \"MDM\" at the source. E.g. all customers come from CRM. use the account\\_key and be done with it. If it's wrong in SalesForce, get them to fix it.\n\nNo?\n\nEDIT: MDM == Master Data Mgmt. See Informatica, Profisee, Reltio",

That makes sense operationally — but it creates a disconnect because business users don’t care about processing time; they care about event time.\nTo complicate things further, it’s also recommended to keep your bronze layer append-only and handle deduplication downstream.\nSo, I have three main questions:\n1. How would you approach partitioning in the bronze layer under these constraints?\n2. How would you design an efficient deduplication view on top of the bronze layer, given that it can contain duplicates and the business only cares about the latest record?\n3. Given that there might be intermediary steps in between, like dbt transformations when going from bronze to gold. How do you partition data in each layer so that your pipeline can scale? \n\nIs achieving idempotentcy and deterministic behavior at scale a huge challenge? \n\nI would be grateful if there are any resources on it that you can point me towards too? \n\n",

Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all.

From there so far so good.\n\nIn dbt, our source points only to the latest file.\nThen we have an incremental model that:\nApply business logic , detected updated columns, build history columns (valid from valid to etc)\n\nMy issue: our history is only inside an incremental model , we can’t do full refresh. The pipeline is not reproducible\n\nMy proposal: add a raw table in between the data lake and dbt \n\nBut received some pushback form business: \n1. We will never do a full refresh \n2. If we ever do, we can just restore the db backup \n3. You will increase dramatically the storage on the db \n4. If we lose the lake or the db, it’s the same thing anyway \n5. We already have the data lake to need everything \n\nHow can I frame my argument to the business ? \n\nIt’s a huge company with tons of business people watching the project burocracy etc.\n\nEDIT: my idea to create another table will be have a “bronze layer” raw layer whatever you want to call it to store all the parquet data, at is a snapshot , add a date column. With this I can reproduce the whole dbt project ",

The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.\n\nAnother challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.\n\nI see two possible options right now:\n\nAsk to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.\n\nResign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.\n\nSo, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here?   \n  \nI don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.\n\nAppreciate any insights or suggestions!\n\nTL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new. Should I ask to be released from my project (with no guarantee of better work) or resign and serve the notice period while job hunting (despite the risk of unemployment)?",

        "content": "Hey guys, looking for feedback on a potential setup. For context, we are a medium sized company and our data department consists of me, my boss and one other analyst. I'm the most technical one, the other two can connect to a database in Tableau and that's about it. I'm fairly comfortable writing Python scripts and SQL queries, but I am not a software engineer.\n\nWe currently have MS SQL Server on prem that was set up a decade ago and is reaching its end of life in terms of support. For ETL, we've been using Alteryx for about as long as that, and for reporting we have Tableau Server. We don't have that much data (550GB total), and we ingest about 50k rows an hour in batched CSV files that our vendors send us. This data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned up before a database can ingest it.\n\nWith the SQL Server getting old and our renewal conversations with Alteryx going extremely poorly, my boss has directed me to research options for replacing both, or scaling Alteryx down to just the last mile for Tableau Server. Our main purposes are 1) upgrade our data warehouse to something with as little maintenance as possible and 2) continue to serve our Tableau dashboards 3) make ad-hoc analysis in Tableau possible for my boss and the other analyst. Ideally, we'd keep our costs to under 70k a year.\n\nSo far I've played around with Databricks, Clickhouse, Prefect, Dagster, and have started doing the dbt fundementals courses to get a better idea of it. While I liked Databricks's unity catalog and time travel capabilities of delta tables, the price and computing power of spark seems like overkill for our purposes/size. It felt like I was spending a lot of time spinning up clusters and frivolously spending cash working out the syntax.\n\nClickhouse caught my eye since it promises fast query times, it is easy enough to set up and put together a sample pipeline together, and the cloud database offering seems cheaper than DBX. It's nice that dbt-core can be used with it as well, because just writing queries and views inside the cloud console there seems like it can get hairy and confusing really fast.\n\nSo far, I'm thinking that we can run local Python scripts for ingesting data into Clickhouse staging tables, then write views on top of those for the cleaner silver + gold tables and let Alteryx/analysts connect to those. The tricky part with CH is how it manages upserts/deletions behind the scenes, but I think with ReplacingMergeTrees and solid queries, we could get around those limitations. It's also less forgiving with schema drift and inferring data types.\n\nSo my questions are as follows:\n\n\n* Does my approach make sense? \n* Are there other products worth looking into for my use case?\n* How do you guys evaluate the feasibility of a setup when the tools are new to you?\n* Is Clickhouse in your experience a solid product that will be around for the next 5-10 years?\n\n\nThank you for your time.",

Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.\n\nFirst, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...\n\nSo, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like \"/tmp/\\*filename.csv\\*\", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.\n\nThe solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this? \n\n  \nThankful for any answers!\n\n ",

The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \\`BroadcastHashJoin\\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.\n\nI had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\\*\\*ks up the performance.\n\n**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.\n\n**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \\`date\\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.\n\nI have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",

The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.\n\nOne challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. \n\nThe evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). \n\nCurrent tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.\n\nMy worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. \n\nDoes this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells? \n\nAppreciate any thoughts or comments!",

        "author": "ApacheDoris",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# 1. Overview\n\nIn analytical database systems, reading data from disks and transferring data over the network consume significant server resources. This is particularly true in the storage-compute decoupled architecture, where data must be fetched from remote storage to compute nodes before processing. Therefore, data pruning is crucial for modern analytical database systems. Recent studies underscore its significance. For example, applying filter operations at the scan node can reduce execution time by over 50% \\[1\\]. PowerDrill has been shown to avoid 92.41% of data reads through effective pruning strategies, while Snowflake reports pruning up to 99.4% of data in customer datasets.\n\nAlthough these results come from different benchmarks and aren't directly comparable, they lead to a consistent insight: for modern analytical data systems, the most efficient way to process data is to **avoid processing it wherever possible.**\n\nAt Apache Doris, we have implemented multiple strategies to make the system more intelligent, enabling it to skip unnecessary data processing. In this article, we will discuss all the data pruning techniques used in Apache Doris.\n\n# 2.Related Works\n\nIn modern analytical database systems, data is typically stored in separate physical segments via horizontal partitioning. By leveraging partition-level metadata, the execution engine can skip all data irrelevant to queries. For instance, by comparing the maximum/minimum values of each column with predicates in the query, the system can exclude all ineligible partitions—a strategy implemented through zone maps \\[3\\] and SMAs (Small Materialized Aggregates) \\[4\\].\n\nAnother common approach is using secondary indexes, such as Bloom filters \\[5\\], Cuckoo filters \\[6\\], and Xor filters \\[7\\]. Additionally, many databases implement dynamic filtering, where filter predicates are generated during query execution and then used to filter data (related studies include \\[8\\]\\[9\\]).\n\n# 3.Overview of Apache Doris's Architecture\n\nApache Doris \\[10\\] is a modern data warehouse designed for real-time analytics. We will briefly introduce its overall architecture and concepts/capabilities of data filtering in this section.\n\n**3.1 Overall Architecture of Apache Doris**\n\nA Doris cluster consists of three components: Frontend (FE), Backend (BE), and Storage.\n\n1. Frontend (FE): Primarily responsible for handling user requests, executing DDL and DML statements, optimizing tasks via the query optimizer, and aggregating execution results from Backends.\n2. Backend (BE): Primarily responsible for query execution, processing data through a series of control logic and complex computations to return the data for users.\n3. Storage: Managing data partitioning and data reads/writes. In Apache Doris, storage components are divided into local storage and remote storage. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7mjdrqffxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fffc7adb40fda731c73e6aaaa8b0bfafa6c823a\n\n**3.2 Overview of Data Storage in Apache Doris**\n\nIn Apache Doris’s data model, a table typically includes partition columns, Key columns, and data columns:\n\n* At the storage layer, partition information is maintained in metadata. When a user query arrives, the Frontend can directly determine which partitions to read based on metadata.\n* Key columns support data aggregation at the storage layer. In actual data files, Segments (split from partitions) are organized by the order of Key columns—meaning Key columns are sorted within each Segment.\n* Within a Segment, each column is stored as an independent columnar data file (the smallest storage unit in Doris). These columnar files further maintain their own metadata (e.g., maximum and minimum values).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2noaz7hfxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b54ee7c7839a09a93cefed64c072e8e34f3cd29e\n\n**3.3 Overview of Data Pruning in Apache Doris**\n\nBased on when pruning occurs, data pruning in Apache Doris is categorized into two types: **static pruning** and **dynamic pruning.**\n\n* Static pruning: Determined directly after the query SQL is processed by the parser and optimizer. It typically relies on pre-defined filter predicates in the SQL. For example, when querying data where `a > 1`, the optimizer can immediately exclude all partitions with `a ≤ 1`.\n* Dynamic pruning: Determined during query execution. For example, in a query with a simple equivalent inner join, the Probe side only needs to read rows with values matching the Build side. This requires dynamically obtaining these values at runtime for pruning.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhgx11bkfxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d715b0ea97894ceff541ef4132f96744b912cfb\n\nTo elaborate on the implementation details of each pruning technique, we further classify them into four types based on pruning methods:\n\n1. Predicate filtering (static pruning, determined by user SQL).\n2. LIMIT pruning (dynamic pruning).\n3. TopK pruning (dynamic pruning).\n4. JOIN pruning (dynamic pruning).\n\nThe execution layer of an Apache Doris cluster usually includes multiple instances, and dynamic pruning requires coordination across instances. This increased the complexity of dynamic pruning. We will discuss the details later.\n\n# 4. Predicate Filtering\n\nIn Apache Doris, static predicates are generated by the Frontend after processing by the Analyzer and Optimizer. Their effective timing varies based on the columns they act on:\n\n* Predicates on partition columns: The Frontend uses metadata to identify which partitions store the required data, enabling direct partition-level pruning (the most efficient form of data pruning).\n* Predicates on Key columns: Since data is sorted by Key columns within Segments, we can generate upper and lower bounds for Key columns based on the predicates. Then, we use binary search to determine the range of rows to read.\n* Predicates on regular data columns: First, we filter columnar files by comparing the predicate with metadata (e.g., max/min values) in each file. We then read all eligible columnar files and compute the predicate to get the row IDs of filtered data.\n\nExample illustration: First, define the table structure:\n\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tbl` (\n        a int,\n        b int,\n        c int\n    ) ENGINE=OLAP\n    DUPLICATE KEY(a,b)\n    PARTITION BY RANGE(a) (\n        PARTITION partition1 VALUES LESS THAN (1),\n        PARTITION partition2 VALUES LESS THAN (2),\n        PARTITION partition3 VALUES LESS THAN (3)\n    )\n    DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(b) BUCKETS 8\n    PROPERTIES (\n        \"replication_allocation\" = \"tag.location.default: 1\"\n    );\n\nInsert sample data to partition 1, partition 2, and partition 3:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd40fsoyfxwf1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=23be57d0ddd3d03acfd5e77f384d3a0f7665b6ee\n\n**4.1 Predicate Filtering on Partition Columns**\n\n    SELECT * FROM `tbl` WHERE `a` > 0;\n\nAs mentioned before, partition pruning is completed at the Frontend layer by interacting with metadata.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xdjujomfxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=af183df6d56c363a619d7d03e9004eabb8f5740d\n\n**4.2 Predicate Filtering on Key Columns**\n\nQuery (where `b` is a Key column):\n\n    SELECT * FROM `tbl` WHERE `b` > 0;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mnkk1e0gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da61909a21390bf8186859d54e07965202374c5\n\nIn this example, the storage layer uses the lower bound of the Key column predicate (`0`, exclusive) to perform a binary search on the Segment. It finally returns the row ID `1` (second row) of eligible data; the row ID is used to read data from other columns.\n\n**4.3 Predicate Filtering on Data Columns**\n\nQuery (where `c` is a regular data column):\n\n    SELECT * FROM `tbl` WHERE `c` > 2;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/973bwl03gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8bff454ceda3cee8e2435eb4d0394b91788912\n\nIn this example, the storage layer utilizes data files from column `c` across all Segments for computation. Before computation, it skips files where the max value (from metadata) is less than the query’s lower bound (e.g., `Column File 0` is skipped). For `Column File 1`, it computes the predicate to get matching row IDs, which are then used to read data from other columns.\n\n# 5. LIMIT Pruning\n\nLIMIT queries are common in analytical tasks \\[11\\]. For regular queries, Doris uses concurrent reading to accelerate data scanning. For LIMIT queries, however, Doris adopts a different strategy to prune data early:\n\n* LIMIT on Scan nodes: To avoid reading unnecessary data, Doris sets the scan concurrency to `1` and stops scanning once the number of returned rows reaches the LIMIT.\n* LIMIT on other nodes: The Doris execution engine immediately stops reading data from all upstream nodes once the LIMIT is satisfied.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hd7hus34gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e188c9c134b8c823207cf3be236d967f044a5fb\n\n# 6. TopK Pruning\n\nTopK queries are widely used in BI (Business Intelligence) scenarios. A TopK query retrieves the top-K results sorted by specific columns. Similar to LIMIT pruning, the naive approach—sorting all data and then selecting the top-K results, incurs high data scanning overhead. Thus, database systems typically use heap sorting for TopK queries. Optimizations during heap sorting (e.g., scanning only eligible data) can significantly improve query efficiency.\n\n**Standard Heap Sorting**\n\nThe most intuitive method for TopK queries is to maintain a min-heap (for descending sorting). As data is scanned, it is inserted into the heap (triggering heap updates). Data not in the heap is discarded (no overhead for maintaining discarded data). After all data is scanned, the heap contains the required TopK results.\n\n**Theoretically Optimal Solution**\n\nThe theoretically optimal solution refers to the minimum amount of data scanning needed to obtain correct TopK results:\n\n* When the TopK query is sorted by Key columns: Since data within Segments is sorted by Key columns (see Section 3.2), we only need to read the first K rows of each Segment and then aggregate and sort these rows to get the final result.\n* When the TopK query is sorted by non-Key columns: The optimal approach is to read and sort the sorted data of each Segment, and then select the required rows—avoiding scanning all data.\n\nDoris includes targeted optimizations for TopK queries:\n\n1. Local pruning: Scan threads first perform local pruning on data.\n2. Global sorting: A global Coordinator aggregates and fully sorts the pruned data, then performs global pruning based on the sorted results.\n\nThus, TopK queries in Doris involve two phases:\n\n* Phase 1: Read the sorted columns, perform local and global sorting, and obtain the row IDs of eligible data.\n* Phase 2: Re-read all required columns using the row IDs from Phase 1 for the final result.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqc3raw5gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc2a4f1fb5f8c35f25f726325f186aece54053b\n\n**6.1 Local Data Pruning**\n\nDuring query execution:\n\n1. Multiple independent threads read data.\n2. Each thread processes the data locally.\n3. Results are sent to an aggregation thread for the final result.\n\nIn TopK queries, each scan thread first performs local pruning:\n\n* Each scan node is paired with a TopK node that maintains a heap of size K.\n* If the number of scanned rows is less than K, scanning continues (insufficient data for TopK results).\n* Once K rows are scanned, discard other unnecessary data. For subsequent scans, use the heap top element as a filter predicate (only scan data smaller than the heap top).\n* This process repeats: scan data smaller than the current heap top, update the heap, and use the new heap top for filtering. This ensures only data eligible for TopK is scanned at each stage.\n\n**6.2 Global Data Pruning**\n\nAfter local pruning, N execution threads return at most N\\*K eligible rows. These rows require aggregation and sorting to get the final TopK results:\n\n1. Use heap sorting to sort the N\\*K rows.\n2. Output the K eligible rows and their row IDs to the Scan node.\n3. The Scan node reads other columns required for the query using these row IDs.\n\n**6.3 TopK Pruning for Complex Queries**\n\nLocal pruning does not involve multi-thread coordination and is straightforward (as long as the scan phase is aware of TopK, it can maintain and use the local heap). Global pruning is more complex: in a cluster, the behavior of the global Coordinator directly affects query performance.\n\nDoris designs a general Coordinator applicable to all TopK queries. For example, in queries with multi-table joins:\n\n* Phase 1: Read all columns required for joins and sorting, then perform sorting.\n* Phase 2: Push the row IDs down to multiple tables for scanning.\n\n# 7. JOIN Pruning\n\nMulti-table joins are among the most time-consuming operations in database systems. From execution perspectives, less data means lower join overhead. A brute-force join (computing the Cartesian product) of two tables of size M and N has a time complexity of O(M\\*N). Thus, Hash Join is commonly used for higher efficiency:\n\n1. Select the smaller table as the Build side and construct a hash table with its data.\n2. Use the larger table as the Probe side to probe the hash table.\n\nIdeally (ignoring memory access overhead and assuming efficient data structures), the time complexity of building the hash table and probing is O(1) per row, leading to an overall O(M+N) complexity for Hash Join. Since the Probe side is usually much larger than the Build side, reducing the Probe side’s data reading and computation is a critical challenge.\n\nApache Doris provides multiple methods for Probe-side pruning. Since the values of the Build-side data in the hash table are known, the pruning method can be selected based on the size of the Build-side data.\n\n**7.1 JOIN Pruning Algorithm**\n\nThe goal of JOIN pruning is to reduce Probe-side overhead without compromising correctness. This requires balancing the overhead of constructing predicates from the hash table and the overhead of probing:\n\n* Small Build-side data: Directly construct an exact predicate (e.g., an `IN` predicate). The `IN` predicate ensures all data used for probing is guaranteed to be part of the final output.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf6mqu69gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6105912b4af14e4cdd37a4b192fdfc6b9ef323\n\n* Large Build-side data: Constructing an `IN` predicate incurs high deduplication overhead. For this case, Doris trades off some probing performance (reduced filtering rate) for a lower-overhead filter: Bloom Filter \\[5\\]. A Bloom Filter is an efficient filter with a configurable false positive probability (FPP). It maintains low predicate construction overhead even for large Build-side data. Since filtered data still undergoes join probing, correctness is guaranteed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0663jhagxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8773c6d6bd82b533c2aab9ad1d9bcfcde51bf4f\n\nIn Doris, join filter predicates are built dynamically at runtime and cannot be determined statically before execution. Thus, Doris uses an adaptive approach by default:\n\n1. First, construct an `IN` predicate.\n2. When the number of deduplicated values reaches a threshold, reconstruct a Bloom Filter as the join predicate.\n\n**7.2 JOIN Predicate Waiting Strategy**\n\nAs Bloom Filter construction also incurs overhead, Doris’s adaptive pruning algorithm cannot fully avoid high query latency when the Build side has extremely high overhead. Thus, Doris introduces a JOIN predicate waiting strategy:\n\n* By default, the predicate is assumed to be built within 1 second. The Probe side waits at most 1 second for the predicate from the Build side. If the predicate is not received, it starts scanning directly.\n* If the Build-side predicate is completed during Probe-side scanning, it is immediately sent to the Probe side to filter subsequent data.\n\n# 8. Conclusion and Future Work\n\nWe present the implementation strategies of four data pruning techniques in Apache Doris: predicate filtering, LIMIT pruning, TopK pruning, and JOIN pruning. Currently, these efficient pruning strategies significantly improve data processing efficiency in Doris. According to the customer data from Snowflake in 2024 \\[12\\], the average pruning rates of predicate pruning, TopK pruning, and JOIN pruning exceed 50%, while the average pruning rate of LIMIT pruning is 10%. These figures demonstrate the significant impact of the four pruning strategies on customer query efficiency.\n\nIn the future, we will continue to explore more universal and efficient data pruning strategies. As data volumes grow, pruning efficiency will increasingly influence database system performance—making this a sustained area of development.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcqv0fkcgxwf1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31f8eec9b95e12c1110facb2bf77b965d5e789d\n\n# Reference\n\n\\[1\\] Alexander van Renen and Viktor Leis. 2023.

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?",

I've been reading through lots of conversations and the general consensus is sort of mixed, but still slightly leaning towards JS fundamentals. I do understand that the official docs also send you off to learn JS, just unsure in what capacity.\n\nAny JS resource I've looked at is largely comprehensive and not something I want to commit to. I've of course done a lot of prior research over the past week and have decided on tools that are TS-first, like Vue or Solid and potentially Astro eliminating the need for Nuxt, where I think Fastify for the backend would be a nice tool to learn, or just go for Nuxt over Fastify if learning something more performant like Go Standard Library in the future.\n\nAs for TS resources, there's a couple that are thrown around, one of which is the official doc/handbook and the second is the Total TypeScript course, money isn't a concern in the slightest if the learning's worth it and I can come out of it being able to hold my own.\n\nI have a bit of C knowledge, nothing of exceptional note though. Would be nice to start learning something that's favored and will be favored in the future and is simply the better of the two rather than what's phasing out, at least in terms of writing code, although I do acknoledge that JS is still the underlying engine and holy grail.",

I think it has a lot more to do with the economy and business side of things than it does with \"capabilities\".\n\nGetting a job has never been about \"yo, i can build advanced and cool software!!\" and yet people put too much emphasis on technologies and what can now be done almost as if the entire tech industry is one giant competition about who can do what the best.\n\nSo is AI really to blame here? Just seeking clarification. And if my take on the subject does matter, I would say it is important to be more business-oriented so you can understand the value you bring to companies because at the end of the day that is why we get hired. Nobody hires someone so they can have a salary. You just gotta prove to them that you are worth the investment.\n\nThese are just my thoughts but if I am wrong please do correct me :)",

        "author": "W_lFF",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.\n\nNow, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.\n\nBuilding projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said \"Nah, I'm not ready.\" \n\nPoint is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",

        "content": "My son (10 years old now) started his coding adventure with the typical things that kids use - block based tools like scratch.\n\nWhen he outgrew those, he moved on to learn open web technologies.   His first two games were built using just HTML, CSS, JS using divs, images and sound apis.  Huge learning curve, and still limited in what you can do.  It didn't stop him though. More importantly, it taught him the fundamentals (arrays, variables, file management, functions, etc), and there's a lot of value in that.\n\nHe wanted to do more advanced stuff, and started learning how to use canvas with requestAnimationFrame. He even started thinking about what a collision detection algorithm would look like (with the help of AI). He never passed the experimentation phase here so a game wasn't released.  But he learned a lot more about the fundamentals.  \n\nIn all the above, he did have support & guidance from parents. So I think having the right mentorship in place is key.\n\nAlong the way, he discovered a game engine (Microsoft Makecode Arcade) which, while limited, gave him so much to build on - tilemaps, input management, animations, integrated sound/image editor, gravity, etc.  Suddenly, his games could become more complex.  Levels, hidden sections and boss battles were all easily approachable.\n\nFrom my observation, picking up the game engine was easy.  He already loosely knew what needed to happen, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do it in the engine.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say: when you want to learn to code, using a game engine on day one will speed you up, but it may also mean you're skipping some valuable fundamentals.  Perhaps, instead, start smaller and explore. Learn the fundamentals and build on it until you naturally are hitting the limits and need something more powerful.\n\nMy son also did a writeup on his experience using a game engine - [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/)\n\n(Disclosure -  Parents provided multiple rounds of feedback to ensure clarity and coherence of his writeup)",

So for me things like logic tables and lookup tables and circuits are quite intuitive now while I still struggle heavily to understand object oriented programming. Assembly is a pain in the ass at the beginning but the structure is nice as it is quite simple in its concepts. Being able to do a lot with less like addition and multiplication is fun.\n\nMy programming setup usually starts (whatever \"language\" or similar things like LaTeX) with a text editor and two to three terminals open. One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. \n\nBut understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next. I still have huge issues with VS code because usually the problems I get are related to git or access privileges in the background. If Mac OS was not a full blown Unix I would have been lost at work. And yes, I still write some \"code\" with pen and paper and optimize things by hand from time to time. ",

It's because most of the operating systems and programming languages were made that are currently used were made at that time for example linux operating systems and popular programming languages like python and C and many more.\n \nMAIN QUESTION:\n\nHow does the programming was learnt back in 1990's , what were the resources used by them maybe manuals or documentations and how would you have learnt programming in 1990's?\n\nMORE CONTEXT:\n To be honest I just want to learn like in self taught way .

Not everything we work on goes to master — some modules can’t be shown in production yet, so they remain in development.\n\nPreviously, I refactored a large existing system from a single repo to a **multi-repo setup**: one repository per module (`auth`, `event`, `cms`, etc.) plus a shared components library published to npm. Each project is deployed on its own subdomain.\n\nThat setup has worked quite well overall, but it has its pros and cons:\n\n* PRs don’t interfere with each other, so I can push some changes to production without affecting other projects.\n* The shared library isn’t a problem since it doesn’t get updated often.\n* There’s some repetitive code like interfaces, hooks, and constants.\n* When the shared library does change, I have to manually bump and update the version in every repo (`event`, `auth`, etc.) to avoid version mismatches — a bit annoying.\n* Each repo has its own CI/CD pipeline; it’s repetitive but helps ensure that if one build fails, the others still deploy fine.\n\n# For this new project, I’m considering a monorepo:\n\n    apps/\n      base/\n      community/\n      registration/\n      store/\n    packages/\n      ui/\n      hooks/\n      interfaces/\n      utils/\n\nEverything in one workspace (using Bun/Turborepo)\n\n**My main doubts are:**\n\n* My intention is to use a monorepo, but my main questions are:\n* If only one app or a single change is ready for production, how is that usually managed in a shared repository?\n* How do you handle CI/CD for multiple apps and the shared core (packages like hooks, ui, etc.)?\n* Would you recommend a monorepo or a multi-repo setup with a shared npm package?\n\n# Stack\n\n* Next.js 15 (app router)\n* TypeScript\n* React Query / GraphQL / API Rest\n* Bun / Turborepo\n* CI/CD with Azure Pipelines",

Basically, there's an \"Events\" section which features a bunch of links to Current and Past Events that the club has hosted and clicking on any of them takes you to a dedicated event page. All of the event pages have more or less the same structure. \n\nI can't imagine having to create pages for each of them manually and then route them all to individual endpoints; it sounds very backwards. I mean, there's no way the guys at Youtube are hand-crafting pages for each of it's videos on the database and then manually connecting a million routes. So what's the solution here?\n\nI heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?\n\nAlso, what to do if I wanted to add some unique flair to some of the event pages (but not all) while still maintaining most of the structure?

Some help with portfolio building would be the most ideal, if the course offers it.\n\nEven if its something like a graduate program, or a program that is not web development related but might be tangentially related would be great to know!

For example, they have this condition in a if :\n\n    if( e.type == SDL_QUIT )\n\nI don't get it. I know that SDL has an Enum called SDL\\_EventType which contains said SDL\\_QUIT but I don't understand how it works. If the Enum is called SDL\\_EventType, how can it be accessed using just \"type\"? Shoudn't the condition be:\n\n`if ( e.SDL_EventType == SDL_QUIT )`\n\nThis is really burning my heard right now. As I said in a previous post, it reminds me of when I learned math at school The teacher would explain something but when it came time to actually use it, it  was someting completely different that I could not figure out by myself.

Things have obviously improved since I started working (I started out as a FE dev) but I still don't feel good enough. I want to be improve my both for job security and also for myself so I can feel more confident. QA is great but it's not my passion life, if the opportunity arose for a good developer position, I would like to be able to grab it if I so desire.\n\nThat's why I'm looking for a good course or bootcamp program, ideally in Python and optionally in Playwright, but most languages are fine by me. Maybe something that really helped you or you swear by. I have around 1000€ in training budget that I have to spend until the end of the year so cost isn't a big issue.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I built out classes for each of these three things, and I want to make rule classes that will take in people, times, and work assignments, and generate the lower level elements to plug into the solver engine.\n\nI've done all that and it works, but I'm running into big picture questions:\n\nIf I have a bunch of existing rules, people, times, work assignments, and I change/delete a person, then how do I ensure consistency in the rules that may reference that deleted person?\n\nShould rules contain value or reference links to the people/times/work assignments? Currently I used references (I understand these are pointers under the hood), but all of the reference links made it very hard for me to achieve the next step, which is saving the rules and everything to a file. I think I need to change the references to a key value that can be used to look up the person or whatever, like a GUID or other such key strategy.\n\nIs there any name for this or more complex programming in general that I can google to learn more about what I'm doing?

The only use case we've found so far is it can help with unit tests, but even then it causes issues at least half of the time.\n\nEverytime I see someone championing AI, it's almost always either people who do it on tiny personal projects, or small codebases that you find in fresh startups.

Can't debug it, can't maintain it, can't extend it (AI does that as well). Most of our seniors are seeing that pattern and yeah we have PR'S for that, but people seem to produce more crap then ever.\n\nI used to spot lazy work much faster in the past. Now I have to dig deeper in every review to find the hidden problems. AI code is creating MORE work for experienced devs, not less. I mean, I use AI by myself, but I can guide the AI much better to get, what I want.\n\nAnyone else dealing with this? How are you handling it in your teams?",

I was discouraged by this and even more, by my background and lack of modern systems experience. \n\nI posted here asking how long it takes to prep for system design interviews from 0.  Many replies were disheartening, like “you need real on-the-job experience.” But it turns out…you don’t—at least not to pass interviews. \n\nHere’s what I did while working full-time:\n\nLeetCode (6 months): Focused on the top 150 problems, revisiting and practicing each one 4-5 times. (I failed many, many interviews along the way).\n\nSystem Design (1.5 months): Started from almost zero and crammed, studying about 15 systems deeply, mainly through videos and practice.\n\nApplications: Sent out over a thousand applications with very low callback. Landed interviews mostly through headhunters. \n\nInterviews (6 months): Juggled my full-time job while going through processes with 45 companies (failing most of them early on).\n\nIt was brutal: endless rejections, self-doubt, and burnout. But I just landed 2 solid offers in AI (around 250k+ TC).\n\nIf you’re in a similar rut, know that it is absolutely doable with consistent effort. You can break free even without the “right” background. AMA if you have questions!",

It now only applies to people applying for jobs in the US from outside of the US.\n\nInternational students return to their previous level of difficulty applying.",

Then if he gets a job, he can leave CRNA and come back if he ever changes his mind. Originally he wanted to leave CRNA and focus on applying and studying full time. ",

        "content": "Hello all. I'm a software dev with about 6 years of experience. I'm in a bit of a tricky situation and need some advice. I was laid off about a year ago and was super happy to find my current role as a software dev engineer about 4 months ago. My background is mostly backend web applications with some front end work (10%) Upon arrival I found out that I'll be part of a devops team which was not a huge issue for me, I've built CICD pipelines in the past and know the basics of what might be required.\n\nAnyway, about 2 months ago I got handed this high visibility project. Basically it is a massive application monorepo and I'm in charge of the pipeline for this project. I've have been struggling to get any support from the team that manages the application. And the person who has become my \"main contact\" is constantly out of office and I'm starting to notice that the delivery target for this pipeline will get delayed. Whenever I bring up any issues to my manager he immediately dismisses my concerns and his rebuttal is \"oh that's not an issue we can resolve it by xyz\" without actually understanding the concern I'm trying to raise. I suppose I could do a better job of not \"accepting\" his answer and trying to make my point clearer but anyway we are kinda past that.\n\nThe other problem is that I've become a defacto project manager. My manager has told me to assign work to other team members and I've had to create a \"second standup\" outside of my main teams standup where we go over the tickets related to this project. My manager has set an aggressive timeline to deliver this project but I'm seeing that we will not be able to deliver it on his timeline and now I'm getting yelled at for delays. I wasn't really expecting to become a project manager for this role, I don't know how to go about dealing my manager who told me in a 1:1 that he would \"rather die than deliver this project late\"\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. On the one hand I'm thinking I can use this opportunity to learn about project management etc however I've started doing the \"project manager\" role really close to the deadline so now I'm getting people up to speed etc while we are expecting to go into production asap. But on the other I'm feeling quite overwhelmed and feeling like this was not my expectations for this role.\n\nThanks for any advice in advance!!",

        "author": "bikinbaebuatcurhat",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my \"potential\" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. \n\nMy manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).\n\n\"You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler.\" I never was.\n\n\"You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before\"\n\n\"You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.\"\n\n\"You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest\"\n\nAmongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?\n\nAnother annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said \"we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?\". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.\n\nBut the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? \"We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.\"\n\nSo what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.\n\nOr, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.\n\nI have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI really need to be honest about something that’s been bothering me.\n\nI recently finished my studies as a *state-certified Business Informatics Specialist (Software Development)*. During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to share this somewhere where people might understand.",

I know my FE shit.\n\nSince end of August I've participated in several processes, both startups and non startups. I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).\n\nI recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.\n\nHere is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.\n\n24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like \"we wanted to see how you would approach the problem\" and \"we didnt see the depth we were looking for\". (honestly I dont buy it)\n\nI accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the \"AI Bubble\" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?\n\nThe other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.\n\nNeedless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \\_very\\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.\n\nI have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.\n\nThe other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.\n\nDuring live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.\n\nRejected",

More importantly, I don't seem to learn much on the job, it's all pretty repetitive work.\n\nI panicked and thought my career growth is gonna be nonexistent,  so I started spraying resume to all the new grad positions blindly several months ago, I was able to get 1-2 offers from some other large company, the pay is on-par with my current company, the work seems more interesting to me, and I signed the offers. \n\nBut now I'm a bit scared when I actually think about job switching.  My manager and my colleagues like me, and my manager is promising a promo in 1-2 years (i know this can be bs), seems like most junior engineers get promoted pretty fast. WLB is ok too.\n\nI chatted with my friends, and it seems like they are all not getting much learning in their job, and it sounds like dealing with a hot mess is a norm in this industry, doesn't that defeat my original purpose for job switching?

        "content": "For context, I’m a 22M recent grad (graduated May 2025) and am working at a F500 insurance company making ~80,000 as a software engineer. I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).\n\nThe company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.\n\nYet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?\n\nI’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.\n\nSo I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences. ",

I finished a 6-month internship at Omnishore, where I worked on a big insurance platform using .NET 8, Angular 19, SQL Server, and CQRS / Clean Architecture. It was tough, but I learned a lot and thought it would open doors.\n\nAfter that, I got accepted for a pre-employment internship at Prestige, moved to another city, paid for transport and a gym, even started building a new routine… and then, out of nowhere, they told me they’re overstaffed.\nNow they’re offering two options:\n\nWork remotely for free for 3 months until a post is open, or\n\nCome on-site full-time with no clear contract yet.\n\n\nHonestly, I feel crushed. I’ve already been through this once — Omnishore also didn’t hire me after promising there was a chance. I’ve been trying hard to stay disciplined, rebuild my life, go to the gym, focus on my health and confidence… but I keep ending up back at zero.\n\nI know I’m not the only one struggling to find a junior dev job, but I feel completely drained. I’m trying to stay calm, rebuild, and not lose faith, but it’s really hard when every opportunity collapses last minute.\n\nIf anyone here has been through this — how did you keep going?\nHow do you rebuild your motivation after months of rejection and uncertainty?\nAny advice for someone who just wants a stable start and peace of mind?",

        "content": "SDE2 of 7 YoE. I've been reorg'd to my current team 1.5 years ago, and it's been a nightmare. I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. \n\nI've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:\n\n1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.\n2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.\n3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.\n4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.\n5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job.\n\n  \nI'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.\n\nAm I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",

        "content": "\nGood day devs! \n\nI’ve been working as a junior software dev (2 YOE) for a couple months now. It’s just me and my boss.  He’s an ex-Reddit engineer with ~15 years of experience, and I come from a web background.\n\nWe’re building a pretty big multi-app Flutter + Firebase project using Clean Architecture, which is all new to me. The main struggle I’m having is that I rarely get clear requirements. Usually I’ll get something like:\n\n“We need a chat box that can also record audio.”\n\nAnd that’s it. From there, I’m expected to figure out everything — UX, architecture, edge cases, and make it up to his standards.\n\nHe doesn’t really walk me through the context or help clarify requirements; I usually just get feedback once I open my first PR. My PRs almost never meet expectations on the first few goes, and sometimes I make rookie mistakes (like forgetting to rebase), which makes me feel even worse. His feedback can be pretty blunt, too.\n\nBecause I’m still learning Flutter, Firebase, and the project structure, things take me a long time — sometimes weeks for a single feature. Even when I do understand the requirements, like for the Auth flow I’m finishing now, it’s still slow progress.\n\nI’m trying hard to improve, but it’s been rough. During my interview, I said I perform above the average junior — and he’s holding me to that, which is fair. But right now I feel like I’m constantly falling short, and I can’t tell if that’s because I’m actually underperforming… or because this setup would be tough for anyone at my level.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\nIs this kind of setup (basically no guidance, just tasks and expectations) normal for a junior? am I genuinely underperforming? And if you’ve been in a similar spot, what helped you get through it?\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nI’m a 2 YOE junior dev working under a super-senior ex-Reddit engineer. I get very vague task descriptions (e.g. “build a chat box that records audio”) and have to figure everything out myself — UX, architecture, edge cases, etc. I’m learning a new stack (Flutter + Firebase + Clean Arch), so progress is slow and feedback is tough. Not sure if I’m actually underperforming or if this setup is just rough for a junior. Looking for advice or perspective.\n",

I have about 2.5 years of total experience, with a little over 2 at Amazon and 6 mo. on a consulting project (which was a wash because I had to take a personal leave for most of it). I didn't get a chance to show much initiative at Amazon, and the projects assigned to me were small in scope, usually solitary, and not all that technically complex. I have found ways to force them to fit a handful of scenarios, but I just don't have enough content to cover all the possible questions. On top of that it's been so long that I can't remember enough detail about my work or team interactions when an interviewer drills down on a project/topic (in retrospect I should have kept a work diary for reference). I end up having to improvise, which always goes poorly and I feel like I'm coming off as a fraud. What should I do for behavioral interviews going forward?

They invited me to interview in person and to get shown around for like 2 days. It is in a different state that would be like an 8-9 hour drive from me. So definitely flying. They told me everything is covered from rental to flight to hotel.\n\nI am in the middle of booking everything now and should I be worried about spending too much? Right now I'm at like $250 for flight, $126 a night for hotel, and then like $200-$300 for rental. They also said meals would be covered by idk how. I know I don't owe the company but I'm not the only one they're flying out so I also don't want to ruin my chances if I overdo it and I'm seen as too much of a hassle to have come in.\n\nAlso any tips for things like these? I will be spending an evening with them so are there specific things I should watch out for or remember?\n\n  \nUpdate: Thanks everyone for the help! The best advice was just asking them because I found out that the admin person organizing everything screwed up some details. The only thing I'm even responsible for is flight and apparently they take care of everything else. I should have just asked first but I got nervous trying to get everything in order because my original date for the interview was pushed up sooner. But it's all good now and I feel much more relaxed lol They are taking care of everything ",

        "content": "\nHey everyone, I'm a Senior Frontend Developer with 8 years of experience currently feeling stuck and worried about my career trajectory. I'd appreciate any strategic advice, especially concerning the current job market.\nMy Current Situation\nI lead a small team as a Tech Lead/Senior Frontend Developer. The problem is, I’m the only truly experienced frontend person here. My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort.\n * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable.\n * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped.\n * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.\nThe Challenge\nI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).\nCrucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.\nMy Questions for the Community\n * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.)\n * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles):\n   * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent?\n   * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise?\n * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the \"only source of truth\" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?\nThanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!\n",

The owners generously gave us a big bonus for the buyout and even negotiated that we keep our jobs for at least 2 years with the new company. After the period we were eventually let go and found new jobs elsewhere.\n\nYesterday I got a message from my old boss asking if id be interested in working on something on the side. I said id be interested in thinking about it, but my life is busy right now. They said theyd work around my schedule. I'm interested in hearing them out, but im wondering what i should ask for compensation. Development could possibly be split by another dev. And i would only be providing dev work. \n\n I'm not hurting for money, but im certainly not going to turn it down lol. Im sure they will probably offer me a wage or lump sum when we hit MVP, but Im more so wondering if i should ask for a share of profits. And if so how much? I should probably hear about the idea first before i decide, but they're smart people, so I have a feeling this idea could be profitable as well. ",
