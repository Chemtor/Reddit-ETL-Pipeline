It’s been running great ever since… but now I’m starting to wonder what’s next — because I need more power. ⚡️\n\nWe use GCP, and process hourly over 2M data points arriving in streaming to pub/sub, then saved to cloud storage.  \nHere goes the pipeline, with a proper batching  i'm able to use 4GB memory cloud run jobs to read parquet, process and export parquet.  \nUntil now everything is smooth, but at the final step this data is used by our dashboard, because polars + parquet files are super fast this used to work properly but recently some of our biggest clients started having some latency and here comes the big debate:\n\nI'm currently querying parquet files with polars and responding to the dashboard\n\n\\- Should i give more power to polars ? mode cpu, larger machine ...\n\n\\- Or it's time to add a Data Warehouse layer ...\n\nThere is one extra challenging point: the data is sort of semi structured. each rows is a session with 2 attributes and list of dynamic attributes, thanks to parquet files and pl.Struct the format is optimized in buckets:\n\n    <s_1, Web, 12, [country=US, duration=12]\n    <s_2, Mobile,13, [isNew=True,...]\n\nMost of the queries will be group\\_by that would filter on the dynamic list (and you got it not all the sessions have the same attributes)  \nThe first intuitive solution was BiGquery, but it will not be efficient when querying with filters on a list of struct (or a json dict)\n\nSo here i'm waiting for you though on this what would you recommend ?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Does it partially read metadata or some sample of the file eagerly?\n\nAlso, another question that came to mind — both Python (Pandas) and Spark can store data in memory, right?  \nSo apart from distributed computation across multiple nodes, what else makes Spark special?  \nLike, if I’m just working on a single machine, is Spark giving me any real advantage over Pandas?\n\nWould love to hear detailed insights from people who’ve actually worked with Spark in production — how it handles schema inference, and what the “real” benefits are beyond just running on multiple nodes.",

And what would make me confident in such tool?\n\nSince dbt became popular, we can roughly define a transformation as:\n\n* a SELECT statement\n* a schema definition (optional, but nice to have)\n* some logic for materialization (table, view, incremental)\n* data quality tests\n* and other elements (semantics, unit tests, etc.)\n\nIf we had a standard we could move a transformation from one tool to another, but also have mutliple tools work together (interoperability).\n\nHonestly, I initially wanted to start building a tool, but I forced myself to sit down and first write a standard for data transformations. Quickly, I realized the specification also needed to include tests and UDFs (this is my pet peeve with transformation tools, UDF are part of my transformations).\n\nIt’s just an initial draft, and I’m sure it’s missing a lot. But it’s open, and I’d love to get your feedback to make it better.\n\nI am also bulding my open source tool, but that is another story.",

But if I want to “replay” millions of messages from the past, how does it do that efficiently without slowing down new writes or consuming huge memory? Is it just sequential disk reads, or is there some smart indexing happening?\n\n2. I get that Kafka can distribute topics across multiple brokers, and consumers can scale horizontally. But if I’m only working with a single node, or a small dataset, what real benefits does Kafka give me over just using a database table as a queue? Are there other patterns or advantages I’m missing beyond multi-node scaling?\n\nI’d love to hear from people who’ve used Kafka in production — how it manages these log mechanics, replaying messages, and what practical scenarios make Kafka truly excels.",

        "author": "Worried_Teaching_707",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working as an AI Architect consultant for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company, and we're in the final forecasting stage for a new \"AI Co-pilot\" feature. This agent is customer-facing, designed to let their Pro-tier users run complex queries against their own data.\n\nThe projected API costs are raising serious red flags, and I'm trying to benchmark how others are handling this.\n\n**1. The Cost Projection:** The agent is complex. A single query (e.g., \"Summarize my team's activity on Project X vs. their quarterly goals\") requires a 4-5 call chain to GPT-4T (planning, tool-use 1, tool-use 2, synthesis, etc.). We're clocking this at **\\~$0.75 per query**.\n\nThe feature will roll out to **\\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \\*(1,000 DAUs \\* 5 queries/day \\* 20 workdays \\* $0.75/query) = **\\~$75,000/month.**\\*\n\nThis turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?\n\n**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).\n\nWe're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an \"Enterprise\" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a \"Pro\" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n* Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce \"ping-pong\"?\n* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a \"pre-LLM\" validation layer?\n* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?\n\nWould appreciate any architecture or strategy insights. Thanks!",

For context, We'll be moving two Glue jobs away from AWS. They wanted to use snowflake. These jobs, responsible for replication from HANA to Snowflake, uses spark.\n\nWhat's the best approaches to achive this? Should I go for ADF only, Databricks only or ADF + Databricks? The HANA is on-prem.\n\nJobs overview-\n\nCurrently, we have a metadata-driven Glue-based ETL framework for replicating data from SAP HANA to Snowflake. The controller Glue job orchestrates everything - it reads control configurations from Snowflake, checks which tables need to run, plans partitioning with HANA, and triggers parallel Spark Glue jobs. The Spark worker jobs extract from HANA via JDBC, write to Snowflake staging, merge into target tables, and log progress back to Snowflake.\n\nHas anyone gone through this same thing? **Please help.**",

        "author": "bond_shakier_0",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m exploring the trade-offs between **database-level isolation** and **application/middleware-level serialisation**.\n\nSuppose I already enforce **per-key serial order** outside the database (e.g., productId) via one of these:\n\n- local **per-key locks** (single JVM),\n\n- a **distributed lock** (Redis/ZooKeeper/etcd),\n\n- a **single-writer queue** (Kafka partition per key).\n\nIn these setups, only one update for a given key reaches the DB at a time. Practically, the DB doesn’t see concurrent writers for that key.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. If serial order is already enforced upstream, does it still make sense to keep the DB at SERIALIZABLE? Or can I safely relax to READ COMMITTED / REPEATABLE READ?\n\n2. Where does **contention** go after relaxing isolation—does it simply move from the DB’s lock manager to my app/middleware (locks/queue)?\n\n3. Any **gotchas, patterns, or references** (papers/blogs) that discuss this trade-off?\n\n**Minimal examples to illustrate context**\n\n**A) DB-enforced (serialisable transaction)**\n\n```sql\nBEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;\n\nSELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = 42;\n-- if stock > 0:\nUPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 42;\n\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n**B) App-enforced (single JVM, per-key lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**\n\n```java\n// map: productId -> lock object\nLock lock = locks.computeIfAbsent(productId, id -> new ReentrantLock());\n\nlock.lock();\ntry {\n  // autocommit: each statement commits on its own\n  int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  if (stock > 0) {\n    exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  }\n} finally {\n  lock.unlock();\n}\n```\n\n**C) App-enforced (distributed lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**\n\n```java\nRLock lock = redisson.getLock(\"lock:product:\" + productId);\nif (!lock.tryLock(200, 5_000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {\n  // busy; caller can retry/back off\n  return;\n}\ntry {\n  int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  if (stock > 0) {\n    exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId);\n  }\n} finally {\n  lock.unlock();\n}\n```\n\n**D) App-enforced (single-writer queue), DB at READ COMMITTED**\n\n```java\n// Producer (HTTP handler)\nenqueue(topic=\"purchases\", key=productId, value=\"BUY\");\n\n// Consumer (single thread per key-partition)\nfor (Message m : poll(\"purchases\")) {\n  long id = m.key;\n  int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", id);\n  if (stock > 0) {\n    exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", id);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI understand that each approach has different failure modes (e.g., lock TTLs, process crashes between select/update, fairness, retries). I’m specifically after **when it’s reasonable to relax DB isolation** because order is guaranteed elsewhere, and how teams reason about the **shift in contention** and **operational complexity**.",

These are difficult to access and update, and we also lack a clear overview of which pipelines are running, when they are running, and whether any have failed. We only get notified by the end users...\n\nWe’re considering migrating to Azure Container Apps or Azure Container App Jobs.  The advantages we see are that we can easily set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy new images and have a straightforward way to schedule runs.  However, one limitation is that we would still be missing a central overview of pipeline runs and their statuses. Does anyone have experience or recommendations for handling monitoring and failure tracking in such a setup? Is a tool like Sentry enough?\n\nWe have also looked into orchestration tools like Dagster and Airflow, but we are concerned about the operational overhead. These tools can add maintenance complexity, and the learning curve might make it harder for our first-line IT support to identify and resolve issues quickly.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach? Does migrating to Azure Container Apps make sense in this case? Are there other alternatives or lightweight orchestration tools you would recommend that provide better observability and management?\n\nThanks in advance for your input!",

Browsing our warehouse layer alone (not all the source tables are hooked up to it) you find dozens of schemas and hundreds of tables. Searching for what should be a standard entity \"Order\" returns dozens of tables with confusing names and varying content. Every person who writes queries in the company (they're in every department) complains about how hard it is to find things. There's a lack of centralized reference tables that give us basic information about our clients and the services we offer them (it's technically not crucial to the architecture of the tools) and each client is configured differently so running queries on all our data is complex.\n\nThe company is still growing and made it this far despite this, **so is it urgent to address this right now?** I don't know. But I'm concerned by my lack of ability to easily answer \"how many clients would be impacted by this Product change.\" (though I'm sure with more time I'll figure it out)\n\n**I pitched to head of Product that I dedicate my next year to focusing on upgrading the data models behind our core business areas**, and to do this in tandem with new Product launches (so it's not just a \"data review\" exercise), but I was met with the reasonable question of \"how would this impact client experience and your personal KPIs?\". The only impact I can think of measuring is reduction in hours spent by eng and data on sifting through things (which is not easy to measure), but cutting costs when you're a growing business is usually not the highest priority.\n\nMy question: **what are metrics have you used to justify data model reviews?** How do you know when a confusing model might be a problem and when?\n\nWelcome all thoughts - thank you!",

        "title": "ZSV – A fast, SIMD-based CSV parser and CLI",
        "author": "mattewong",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm the author of [zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv) ([https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv))\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n\\- the fastest and most versatile bare-metal real-world-CSV parser for any platform (including wasm)\n\n\\- \\[edited\\] also includes CLI with commands including \\`sheet\\`, a grid-line viewer in the terminal (see comment below), as well as sql (ad hoc querying of one or multiple CSV files), compare, count, desc(ribe), pretty, serialize, flatten, 2json, 2tsv, stack, 2db and more\n\n\\- [install](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv/blob/main/INSTALL.md) on any OS with brew, winget, direct download or other popular installer/package managers\n\n**Background:**\n\nzsv was built because I needed a library to integrate with my application, and other CSV parsers had one or more of a variety of limitations. I needed:\n\n\\- handles \"real-world\" CSV including edge cases such as double-quotes in the middle of values with no surrounding quotes, embedded newlines, different types of newlines, data rows that might have a different number of columns from the first row, multi-row headers etc\n\n\\- fast and memory efficient. None of the python CSV packages performed remotely close to what I needed. Certain C based ones such \\`mlr\\` were also orders of magnitude too slow. xsv was in the right ballpark\n\n\\- compiles for any target OS and for web assembly\n\n\\- compiles to library API that can be easily integrated with any programming language\n\nAt that time, SIMD was just becoming available on every chip so a friend and I tried dozens of approaches to leveraging that technology while still meeting the above goals. The result is the zsv parser which is faster than any other parser we've tested (even xsv).\n\nWith parser built, I added other parser nice-to-haves such as both a pull and a push API, and then added a CLI. Most of the CLI commands are run-of-the-mill stuff: echo, select, count, sql, pretty, 2tsv, stack.\n\nSome of the commands are harder to find in other utilities: compare (cell-level comparison with customizable numerical tolerance-- useful when, for example, comparing CSV vs data from a deconstructed XLSX, where the latter may look the same but technically differ by < 0.000001), serialize/flatten, 2json (multiple different JSON schema output choices). A few are not directly CSV-related, but dovetail with others, such as 2db, which converts 2json output to sqlite3 with indexing options, allowing you to run e.g. \\`zsv 2json my.csv --unique-index mycolumn | zsv 2db -t mytable -o my.db\\`.\n\nI've been using zsv for years now in commercial software running bare metal and also in the browser (for a simple in-browser example, see [https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/](https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/)), and we've just tagged our first release.\n\nHope you find some use out of it-- if so, give it a star, and feel free to post any questions / comments / suggestions to a new issue.\n\n[https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)",

How do I deal best with this type of data as a data engineer? Putting data into a quarantine time agreed upon with the owner of the data source, and only publishing it after? If data changes significantly, models need to be re-run, which can be very time consuming.\n\nFor data exploration, the time series + location data are displayed in a hydrological application, while a basic interface would probably suffice. We'd need a simple interface to display all of these time series (also deducted ones, in total maybe 5k), point locations and polygons, and connect them together. What applications would you recommend? With preference managed applications, and otherwise simple frameworks with little maintenance. Maybe Dash + TimescaleDB / PostGIS?\n\nWhat other theory could be valuable to me in this job and where can I find it?\n\n",

Crucially, the final hiring decision is contingent upon the career path I choose to pursue within the company, based on my current responsibilities.\nTeam Structure and Responsibilities\nOur current technical data team consists of three individuals: the CDO, myself, and a colleague focused on dashboarding and visualization, who will soon be transitioning to another sector within the organization.\nFor the past four months, I have been solely responsible for the conception and implementation of our data infrastructure architecture, including the deployment of all initial ETL pipelines. A substantial amount of work remains, with numerous ETL pipelines still needing to be developed. If I choose to handle this volume of work entirely on my own and maintain my current pace, there is a risk of significant burnout.\n\nTo elevate my expertise and ensure I am making robust technical decisions, I plan to obtain the GCP Data Engineer Certification in the coming months.\nI am proficient in programming, system integration, problem-solving, and I am growing confident in pipeline implementation. However, I occasionally question this confidence, wondering if it stems from the repetitive nature of the process or the current absence of a direct manager to provide supervision and critical technical oversight.\nI was quite concerned when the CDO asked me to define the role I should assume starting next month, given the upcoming senior hire.\n\n \n* Should I assume the leadership risk and position myself to manage the new senior hire (e.g., as a Team Lead or BI Manager)?\n * Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role?\n * What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path?\n*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?\n\nI think they see me with leadership potential but I definitely think that I need to improve as a DE to have more confidence in myself.

That's when I started the journey of learning how databases are implemented.\n\nAfter a few weeks of research and coding, I've completed the first version of my file-based database. This version is append-only, using LSN to insert, update, delete, and locate records. It also uses a B+ Tree for collection entries, allowing for fast ID:LSN lookup. When the B+ Tree reaches its max size (I've set it to 1500 entries), the tree will be encoded (using my custom encoder) and atomically written to disk before an empty tree takes the old one's place in-memory.\n\nI'm sure I'm there are things that I'm doing wrong, as this is my first time researching how databases work and are optimized. So, I'd like feedback on the code or even the concept of this library itself.\n\nJust wanna state that this wasn't vibe-coded at all. I don't know whether it's my pride or the fear that AI will stunt my growth, but I make a point to write my code myself. I did bounce ideas off of it, though.

I see this most in two places: 1) the semantic layer and 2) the control plane.\n\nOn the first point, if AI writes SQL and its answers aren't correct for whatever reason - different names for data elements across the data stack, different definitions for the same metric - this is where a semantic model comes in. It's basically giving the LLM the context to create the right results. \n\nOn the second point, it seems data infrastructure and AI infrastructure are collapsing into one control plane. For example, analytics are now agent-facing, not just customer-facing. This changes the requirements for data processing. Quality and lineage checks need to be available to agents. Systems need to meet latency requirements that are designed around agents doing analytic work and retrieving data effectively. \n\nHow are y'all seeing this show up? What steps are y'all taking when implementing these semantic data models? Which metrics, context, and ontology are you providing to the LLMs to make sure results are good?",

Between Databricks Apps (especially the new Node.js support), the addition of transactional databases, and the already huge set of analytical and ML tools, it really feels like Databricks is becoming a full-on data powerhouse.\n\nA lot of companies already move and transform their ERP data in Databricks, but most people I talk to complain about every ERP under the sun (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, etc.). Even just extracting data from these systems is painful, and companies end up shaping their processes around whatever the ERP allows. Then you get all the exceptions: Access databases, spreadsheets, random 3rd-party systems, etc.\n\nI can see those exception processes gradually being rebuilt as Databricks Apps. Over time, more and more of those edge processes could move onto the Databricks platform (or something similar like Snowflake). Eventually, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Databricks or partners offer 3rd-party templates or starter kits for common business processes that expand over time. These could be as custom as a business needs while still being managed in-house.\n\nThe reason I think this could actually happen is that while AI code generation isn’t the miracle tool execs make it out to be, it *will* make it easier to cross skill boundaries. You might start seeing hybrid roles. For example a data scientist/data engineer/analyst combo, or a data engineer/full-stack dev hybrid. And if those hybrid roles don't happen, I still believe simpler corporate roles will probably get replaced by folks who can code a bit. Even my little brother has a programming class in fifth grade. That shift could drive demand for more technical roles that bridge data, apps, and automation. \n\nWhat do you think? Totally speculative, I know, but I’m curious to hear how others see this playing out.",

That felt like something pandas should make easier.\n\nThe library helps with swapping columns, moving multiple columns before or after others, pushing blocks to the front or end, sorting columns by variance, standard deviation or correlation, and grouping them by dtype or NaN ratio. All helpers are typed, validate column names and work with `inplace=True` or `df.pipe(...)`.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols](https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols)\n\nI’d love to know:\n\n• Does this overlap with utilities you already use or does it fill a gap?  \n• Are the APIs intuitive (`move_after(df, [\"A\",\"B\"], \"C\")`, `sort_columns(df, by=\"variance\")`)?  \n• Are there features, tests or docs you’d expect before using it?\n\n  \nAppreciate any feedback, bug reports or even “this is useless.”  \nThanks!",

        "author": "RockaBabyDarling",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nI shared this with some of my most senior software developer buddies and they said dude you need to share this again but in a better time window where more people will see it because it got lost too soon, so I'm doing that. I know I could probably go look at several analytics websites but I feel like midday on Saturday is probably a good time. The rest is my original post.\n\nI've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.\n\nIf you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.\n\nI've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.\n\nIf you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:\n\n**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**\n\nTake as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as \"you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,\" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, \"Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,\" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.\n\n**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**\n\nDo some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.\n\n**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**\n\nMany people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.\n\n**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself \"what was I thinking here?\" then you're not growing.**\n\nDon't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.\n\nLastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking \"okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,\" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.\n\nSo if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.",

The AI stuff can do university type learning projects for you while you are in school but all of you are cheating yourselves out of the learning you are paying for.\n\nJust so you know a little more about the problem of not knowing what AI is doing for you. AI cannot build or maintain real projects (the kind you do when you have a job) on its own without a good navigator. A good navigator knows how to guide AI to a successful mostly deterministic result. You have to be a good software developer to be a good navigator.\n\nLearn how to be a good software developer. Build projects. That is the only way to become a good software developer. School projects, bootcamps, leetcode, youtube, and AI will not make you a good software developer.\n\nStart building projects now.",

This turned out to be way more insightful than I expected, and it’s been really interesting seeing the different ways people think about learning in the AI era!\n\nA few themes kept coming up across the comments:\n\n• **Fundamentals still matter.** A lot of you emphasized that you need a foundation before AI becomes useful, otherwise it’s hard to judge whether it’s right or wrong.  \n• **Struggle is part of the process.** Many pointed out that the hard moments are where real learning actually sticks, and shortcuts can get in the way of that.  \n• **AI works best as a tool, not a replacement.** Whether as a tutor, a rubber duck, a source of counterexamples, or something to challenge your thinking, people found value when they stayed active in the process.  \n• **Cross-checking is essential.** Docs, references, books, and traditional sources still form the backbone of understanding, with AI helping fill in gaps or clarify confusing parts.  \n• **Context and reasoning matter more than answers.** Several of you mentioned that the real benefit came from understanding *why* something works, not just having AI fix it.\n\nReally appreciate everyone who took the time to give thoughtful responses. This was a great mix of advice from beginners, students, and developers with years of experience, and the range of perspectives has been super valuable. Thanks again for all the insight!!!",

        "content": "I can write code pretty well. If someone gives me a clear plan, I can implement it, debug it, and ship it. If I have built something similar before, I can rebuild it fast.\n\nBut the moment I have to design the architecture, data flow, or figure out what talks to what by myself, I just freeze. I do not know where to start, I second-guess every choice, and I end up hacking something together that works but feels messy.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is that if I ask AI to design the structure for the app, it gives me a much cleaner architecture and code layout than I would have ever come up with. Instead of helping, it sometimes demotivates me, because it feels like AI is already better at the part I am trying to learn.\n\nSo now I am wondering:\n\n* Is this normal for early devs?\n* Does architecture/ code structure  come with experience, or do people actually study it as a separate skill?\n* How do you practice code architecture when you do not even know what a good one looks like?\n* Is relying on AI for structure a bad habit, or is it just the new normal?\n\nI do not use AI to write the full code, only the skeleton, and even that already results in something way cleaner than what I would design myself.\n\nHow did I bridge this gap?\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks everyone for the inputs. I think my main issue comes from my history of working in early stage startups where I had to come up with architecture, design, and working code really quickly. The tight deadlines didn’t help either, and there was very little room for mistakes, I was expected to just make things work. That kind of environment made me dependent on AI and caused me to get demotivated easily and have imposter syndrome i believe.I’ll spend more time in my free hours building systems on my own without relying on AI  to fix this.",

So, I'm wondering: Are there maybe other random algorithms that can work in reverse? That can maybe get seed from values?

I heard that if I study for three years and then one more year, I can earn an extra degree — so I plan to stay in community college for a total of four years.\n\nRight now, I’m a first-year student learning the C language.\nBut honestly… it’s my first time ever learning about computers, so I’m having a hard time keeping up. I started getting confused when we began learning about nested if statements 😭\n\nAnyway, here’s my main question:\n👉 What do you think is the most important thing to focus on when studying C?\n\nI plan to review everything during the vacation, and I want to know which parts are absolutely essential — the “you must know this no matter what!” kind of stuff.\n\nIf you could also share your own study tips or personal tricks, that would mean a lot! I’ve realized that what we learn from textbooks and what’s used in real-world programming are totally different things.\n\nI’ve thought about switching to another language, but I still believe that C is the foundation of programming. Python feels simpler, but sometimes harder to fully understand.\n\nI know it might be a bit surprising to see a Korean student pop up here, but I wanted to ask this question in a big, experienced community like this one.\nI’ve read some posts here, and many people seem super knowledgeable and kind. This is my first time joining a foreign community, so I might make some mistakes — but I’ll do my best!\n\nThanks so much for reading, and I really appreciate any advice you can share 🙏",

        "author": "ZealousidealKale2042",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nThroughout my years of studying programming and work, I have always had the same question. I don't know how to properly find various tools and libraries.\n\nWhile developing projects or doing my work, I tend to use the simplest and most straightforward approaches, relying on old and time-tested techniques that are hard to ignore when learning programming.\n\nWhen faced with a problem or task, I turn to Google for a solution. I usually find one, but it's often not the most efficient or optimal solution. Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.\n\nEach time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.\n\nBut also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).\n\nMany of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, \"FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift.\" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?\n\nAnd this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.\n\nWhen I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.\n\nI find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.\n\nOften, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.\n\nAnd it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.\n\nThere is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.\n\nI understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.\n\nIn my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.\n\nTLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?\n\nI am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your help.",

I don't have anything expensive going on now, but if I did, that would not be good at all. I can't imagine tech companies deploying backends that way.

        "content": "It is day 3 of trying to wrap my head around it and I'm feeling closer to the truth but still not quite there, looking for the final mental relay to click in this connection.\n\nI have no clue what \"monoids\" or \"endofunctors\" are supposed to be, nor do i care *yet*. This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.\n\nIn essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:\n\n* Purity\n* Chaining of operations / composition\n\nKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:\n\n* Monads wrap around other \"things\"\n* The \"thing\" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad\n   * This operation can also be a \"chain of operations\", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be \"one abstract step\" on the outside\n* Monads that \"do something\" (= arent simply context), like IO, are \"lazy\". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)\n* The \"result\" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval \"unwrapping\"\n* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants\n   * They always are 100% pure \"representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value\"\n   * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O\n   * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that \"runs\" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about \"in -> out\"\n\nIf all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not \"that difficult to understand\", so I have to have missed something, right?\n\nI guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both \"let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value\".",

And asked AI for the formula for Farenheit too Celsius. F -32 times 5/9, with \\* and decimal points in Java. Okay. And I know System.out.println.  \n\nBut wait, program is still not outputting. I ask AI to explain the issue. Turns out, I declared a variable wrong. \n\nThen, I try too improve it. \n\nI ask AI what I can do too make the program better. They suggest how to do While Loops. Okay, I ask for an example and look that up in Java MOOC and try too implement it. \n\nI've been doing it on my Lab exercises, and I find I retain more information this way.

        "content": "As I observe the rise of tools like Interview Coder, I find myself questioning the very concept of \"merit\" in the tech industry. When an AI can assist you during a live coding interview by providing support with logic, syntax, and hints, can we truly claim we are testing merit, or are we merely assessing access to the right tools? Let’s face it: tech interviews have never been solely about skill. They have always been a complex mix of several factors:\n\n* How well you can recall patterns you studied the previous week,,\n* How fortunate you are with the problem set you receive, and,\n* How composed you can remain while someone observes your screen.,\n\nNow, with the introduction of AI tools, the fragility of this entire system is being exposed. If someone using Interview Coder performs like a top 1% developer, should we consider that \"cheating,\" or does it suggest that our interview process was never as robust as we thought? Perhaps the definition of merit is evolving from “I can solve this alone” to “I know how to use tools effectively.”",

Our professor also wants something that simplifies existing processes basically, a system that makes tasks faster and more efficient for users.\n\nWe’re looking for unique yet practical ideas something realistic to build within a semester but not the usual attendance or inventory system.\n\nAny suggestions for project ideas that focus on usability, accessibility, and efficiency would be really helpful. Thanks in advance! 🙏",

I would like to understand how to improve my position, both in terms of skills and job opportunities.\n\nAt the moment I work mainly with Angular, but I also have some experience with React.

Is it better to focus on mobile (native or cross-platform) or invest in other technologies that are more in demand internationally? And, in general, what steps would you suggest to make me more competitive on the market?\n\nThanks to anyone who wants to share an opinion or their experience!",

I went all-in on the frontend, but I completely botched the backend and now I'm stuck. I could really use some advice on how to dig myself out of this hole.\n\nWhat I Built (The Good part): · Tech Stack: React Native, TypeScript, React Native Reanimated · The Look: A custom iOS 26 \"Liquid Glass\" inspired UI. · The Feel: Buttery 60fps animations, a type-safe codebase with zero errors, and optimized transitions. · Status: The entire frontend is basically done. It's a high-fidelity prototype. I can even show you a screen recording of how smooth it is.\n\nWhere I Failed (The ugly part ):\n\n· The Mistake: I started coding with ZERO backend design or data model. I just started putting stuff in Firestore as I went along. · The Stack: Firebase Auth & Firestore. · The Problem: My database structure is a complete mess. It's not scalable, the relationships between users, universities, professors, and reviews are tangled, and I'm now terrified to write more queries because nothing makes sense anymore. I basically built a beautiful sports car with a lawnmower engine.\n\nWhat I’m blabbing about is:\n\n1.\t⁠How do I approach untangling this? Do I just nuke the entire Firestore database and start over with a clean plan?\n2.\t⁠What are the key questions I should be asking myself when designing the data structure for an app like this?\n3.\t⁠Are there any good resources (articles, videos) on designing Firestore structures for complex relational data?\n4.\t⁠If you were to sketch a basic data model for this, what would the top-level collections be and how would they relate?\n\nInfact what should be my best approach to transitioning to backend then to a Fullstack Developer? I learned a ton about frontend development, but this was my brutal lesson in the importance of full-stack planning. Any guidance you can throw my way would be a lifesaver.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "author": "queenoyster",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "https://imgur.com/a/iRI5FRT\n\nI wanted to share my experience interviewing for the past two months in this market.  \n\nI have a Bachelors of Science in a field unrelated to computer science and graduated in 2020, straight into COVID-world. I'd taken a few computer science courses, so I spent my last semester of university looking for software engineer roles knowing we were probably going to be remote for a while.\n\nI've been working for five years, with most of that time at Amazon. I've been a mid-level engineer for roughly 1.5 years, but feel that I should've been promoted sooner. Despite what people say about working at Amazon, I've enjoyed my four years here. I lucked out with finding a good team and manager.\n\nMy main reasons for leaving are:\n\n- Amazon comp philosophy is bad. You are assigned stock to meet a target compensation number, with the assumption that the stock will increase 15% YoY. The stock has actually gained 10% YoY since I've started, which means I'm paid less than my target. The solution to this is Amazon assigns more stock that vests the following years to make up for the gap. This means you'd have to stay longer to meet your target compensation. The reverse is also true. If your actual compensation surpasses your target because of stock gains, then you are assigned fewer/no additional stock vests for the next few years. The employee loses when the stock does well and when the stock does poorly.\n- Layoffs were coming. The volume of posts about layoffs occurring later this year dramatically increased across Blind, internal Slack, r/amazonemployees, various Discords, etc. Morale was already bad since we did two layoffs prior to 2025.\n- My work was getting stale.\n- I felt there was no path to senior for me in the next four years.\n- I distrust my org's leadership.\n- I'm in Seattle for Amazon and I've accepted it's not my city. I'd like to move to New York City or San Francisco.\n\nMost of the jobs I applied to came from LinkedIn, but I applied manually through the employer's website. I targeted midlevel engineering roles if they were available, otherwise, I applied for senior. Towards the tail end of my job search, I used a browser extension called Simplify to autofill applications. I highly recommend this since you can also use it to keep track of your applications, scrum board style. I spread out my applications so that I would have interviews for the two following weeks.\n\nTo prepare for my interviews, I bought a year of Leetcode premium and a lifetime subscription to HelloInterview premium. I also joined a Slack server targeted towards engineering leadership career development and participated in mock interviews there. My friends generously offered their time to mock interview me as well. These were great because they gave me very candid feedback. I also searched through Glassdoor for other peoples' interview experiences to get an idea of what to expect for companies I was highly interested in. My weakest round is probably the coding round; I completed 160 Leetcode during this interview cycle and felt that was sufficient. I should note that I would've practiced more Leetcode if I were interviewing with large tech companies like Google or Microsoft, but I didn't hear back from them. I also had never done a system design interview before this job application cycle, so I studied that hard. I read every HelloInterview system design article and felt I overprepared.\n\nManaging emotions around rejection was pretty difficult, I'm thankful I have good friends I could talk to. I got rejected from my top 3 target companies and I bedrotted for weeks beating myself up over it. If I were to have done anything different, I would've front-loaded my interviews with companies I cared less about. I felt much more comfortable in my later interviews. I also would've spaced out my interviews more. It was difficult balancing them and a full-time job. I tried to do early morning interviews (I even had two 2AM ones!), but found that my performance really suffered in the morning. I'd block out time in the afternoon instead to do interviews and pray no one at work wanted to schedule over them. I'd often work after hours to catch up on work I'd neglected during the day.\n\nI ended this interview cycle with 5 offers: 2 senior and 3 mid-level. Two of these offers were at late stage SF-based AI startups (not any of the big names). I accepted one of these. I don't want to reveal exact numbers, but I'll say that my base comp exceeds my total comp at Amazon, and I am extremely happy with it.",

I’ve heard various reasons of why SF is better, such as career growth and opportunity. But I still don’t understand why this would be the case. There are so many talented engineers and companies in NYC and Seattle as well as ton of opportunity.\n\nI feel like I must be missing something. I really want to move to NYC since living in NYC in your 20s can only be done once. But I also don’t want to miss out on whatever it is that everyone is telling me is so great about SF, which I personally haven’t seen myself. So I’m hoping someone can help me understand why I should stay here for my career.\n\nAnd yes if I move I would change teams because I understand that not being in the same physical location as the rest of your team might hinder growth since you have less proximity.",

I was laid off in the last week of 2024 and have been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for the past 10 months. I have 5 years of experience at a FAANG company and consider myself good at selling myself because I consistently make it to final interview rounds, but I’ve not landed a single offer all year. Now it’s November and I just got the ‘no offer’ emails after final rounds with two more companies (I think I have failed 12 final loops now). \n\nWhat do I do now? I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:\n- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews\n- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies \n- I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me\n- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything \n- I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviews\n\nAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciated\n\nEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying. I don’t normally post on social media but getting to discuss this anonymously with others has been very helpful. \n\nAs many have pointed out, my interview skills are not perfect, and I when I get feedback it’s generally about the system design round. While I can easily create a high level design and have used Hello Interview to practice, I still slip up when asked for low level details about components I haven’t worked with. ",

        "author": "JagoffAndOnAgain",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**tl;dr** 1. Paid an expert to redo my resume, and 2. Ignored LinkedIn/Indeed completely. Bookmarked and applied directly through company Careers/Jobs pages for brand new positions only.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, I was laid off from a full stack job I loved and was at for 9 years. The severance package provided some \"career coaching and resume assistance\" via Randstad. So I used them to redo my resume which I had always done entirely myself with no external help, including AI. I thought it was a lot better.\n\nI was wrong. Throughout the next 6 months in the spring and summer of 2023, I applied to 171 jobs (with 13 YoE at the time). I heard back from 12 (7%), was ghosted by 5 of those and rejected by 4 more. When I accepted my contract position, I ended two other interviews.\n\nCut to this summer 2025. I was thankful for the contract position but wasn't particularly interested in the domain. Also, I got cabin fever working remotely. My new apartment's home office is a lot sadder than the old one. I need to get out of the house and see the sun which I don't do when WFH. I totally understand why most people love WFH- I did it for years. It's just not great for me personally long term. For all this reasons, I began hunting despite the doom and gloom around the current job market.\n\nFor a few months, I stuck to my old habits. I added my current position to my resume but kept it basically the same as before. I applied to LinkedIn posts along with hundreds of other people. And I was back to my 2023 numbers. In fact, it was worse. I was only hearing back 5% of the time (which this time was only one job) and they ghosted me after one interview. Fuckers.\n\n---\n\n**1.** I realized I needed a change. I had a gut feeling my resume wasn't great. It wasn't getting me the first look. I'm a software engineer, not a resume expert. These are two entirely different skillsets. A younger me scoffed at the idea of resume writing being valuable: \"I write great code on cool systems, that should be easy enough for anyone to glean from my resume!\" Idiot. I searched \"software engineer resume coach\" and found one with great TrustPilot reviews. I spent $300 for someone to take my old resume, ask me clarifications, and return a brand new resume back to me about a week later.\n\nI cannot tell you how much of an upgrade the second resume is. The first one looks like dogshit by comparison. My old resume was a massive wall of text combining some tech keywords with the resume guidance of the late 2000's (my college era when I learned to write a resume). This new version had largely the same information, but it was presented in a much more impressive way. I was impressed by my own resume. It also surprisingly gave me a new sense of confidence going into interviews. It had way more metrics and quantitive points than I had on there.\n\nMy callback rate when from 5% to 25%. Post-resume glow up, I applied to 12 positions and heard back from 3. Pretty stunning turnaround.\n\nBut an improved resume wasn't the only thing I changed in this round of job hunting. I changed my application tactics.\n\n---\n\n**2.** In 2023 and part of my 2025 hunt, I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn applying to jobs according to filters and advanced searches. This just never felt particularly useful. You're adding another layer of software between your resume and a human being's eyes. Also, I just hate LinkedIn. People are so strange and phony on there. So I abandoned it.\n\nInstead, I started searching for lists of companies based in my city. I would then bookmark their Careers or Jobs pages in a folder in my browser. By the end of my hunt, I bookmarked about 55 pages. And a few times per week, I would spent about half an hour looking at every single one.\n\nI was looking for jobs posted within the last 48 hours but ideally that day. If a day was posted longer than 3 days ago, I considered it a dead end. You want to be in the first 50 in a stack of resumes.\n\nJob posting aggregators are a wasteland. I think these days HR looks at the stack of applications in their domain first, then looks to LinkedIn and Indeed if they see nothing promising.\n\n---\n\nWith these two tactics, I interviewed with a few places, narrowed it down to two, and chose the one I was most excited about. It's been off to a good start so far.\n\nAnyways, that is my advice from my past few years of job hunting in the frustrating market/economy/country/existence. Good luck!\n\nWhen I posted this to r/experienceddevs I got accused of being an ad almost instantly, so FYI I will not be recommending the resume service I used. Just search around and I'm sure you'll find someone capable. This is merely advice for what seemed to work for me.",

        "content": "Thought it’d be useful for those in this field who are worried about the impact of AI on their careers, especially new grads and prospective CS students, to read this post by Andrew Ng (prominent ML/DL expert who confounded Google Brian and Coursera) on the harm of overhyping AI.\n\n**TL;DR** Frontier model progress is incredible especially how much it can generalize compared to DL pre-LLM, but it’s still nowhere near general enough for majority of human tasks especially in CS careers where a human in the loop will still be required for custom solutions. So don’t bogged down by the hype.\n\n[Twitter post](https://xcancel.com/AndrewYNg/status/1989003741316673714)\n[Blog post](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-327/)\n\nHighlighting the most relevant bits:\n\n> Andrew Ng @AndrewYNg \n> I recently received an email titled “An 18-year-old’s dilemma: Too late to contribute to AI?” Its author, who gave me permission to share this, is preparing for college. He is worried that by the time he graduates, AI will be so good there’s no meaningful work left for him to do to contribute to humanity, and he will just live on Universal Basic Income (UBI). I wrote back to reassure him that there will still be plenty of work he can do for decades hence, and encouraged him to work hard and learn to build with AI. But this conversation struck me as an example of how harmful hype about AI is.\n> […]\n> Even though LLMs can handle a much more general set of tasks than previous iterations of AI technology, compared to what humans can do, they are still highly specialized. They’re much better at working with text than other modalities, still require lots of custom engineering to get it the right context for a particular application, and we have few tools — and only inefficient ones — for getting our systems to learn from feedback and repeated exposure to a specific task (such as screening resumés for a particular role).\n> […]\n> AI has stark limitations, and despite rapid improvements, it will remain limited compared to humans for a long time.\n> […]\n> Modern AI is a general purpose technology that is enabling many applications, but AI that can do any intellectual tasks that a human can (a popular definition for AGI) is still decades away or longer. This nuanced message that AI is general, but not that general, often is lost in the noise of today's media environment.\n> […]\n> Similarly, the progress of frontier models is amazing! But not so amazing that they’ll be able to do everything under the sun without a lot of customization. I know VC investors who are scared to invest in application-layer startups because they are worried that frontier AI model companies will quickly wipe out all of these businesses by improving their models. While some thin wrappers around LLMs no doubt will be replaced, there also remains a huge set of valuable applications that the current trajectory of progress of frontier models won’t displace for a long time.",

They believe they will make back their unrealized gains. Some of their reasoning is:\n\n> It will bounce back, tech stocks are still in a bull market!\n\n> I work for the company and things are going really well right now!\n\n> It's performed really well in the past!\n\n*None of this matters.* Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Most companies that were listed on stock exchanges 100 years ago are *gone*. Many tech stocks today have high P/E ratios and other indicators that suggest they are overvalued. If the AI bubble bursts, it is highly likely that your company's stock will take a hit, regardless of how you perceive their level of exposure to that area.\n\nImagine having a large percentage of your net worth tied up in one stock you picked. This is what you have, effectively. I'm not going to give people here a full rundown on basic investing, but a diversified portfolio is always a strong choice. Speak with an investment professional.

A few weeks later, I got an invitation to interview. The interview went alright, but the interviewer said something that made me a little iffy. So I checked the company’s LinkedIn page, looked at their associated members, and found out they only have 19 employees—16 of them being unpaid interns. Their bio even says the company has fewer than 30 employees.\n\nThis can’t be legal, right? Even when I looked at the job descriptions for some of the intern positions, they expect you to do actual work for the company for free. And what’s even the point of an internship if almost everyone working there is an intern? Are you supposed to learn from other interns?",

I think I need a reality check, especially from those who have worked in this field for a number of years.\n\n**TL;DR:** Top-tier education (CS PhD). Landed a quant developer job at a fund in a low-tax / no-tax region. Pay is relatively good (\\~$185k tax-free money). Job was a \"bait-and-switch\", which went from building cool new tech to endless data-munging. I'm miserable and have lost passion for coding.\n\n**My Background:**\n\n* **Education:** PhD in CS (Systems and Networking) from a top Asian university. BSc from another top Asian university.\n* **Current Role:** 1 year as a quant developer at a financial firm (think HFT or fund) in a major hub with very low / no taxes.\n\n**The \"Golden Handcuffs\":**\n\n* **Salary:** In the $180-190k USD range, tax-free.\n* **Perks:** Good vacation and remote policy.\n\n**The \"Bait-and-Switch\" Problem:**\n\n* The first 6 months was great. I was tasked with a challenging R&D project using a modern tech stack (Rust), which I had to learn on the fly. It was exactly what I wanted.\n* Afterwards, that project was suddenly and quietly de-prioritized. My manager reassigned me to what is effectively a data integration role. My entire job now is just endless, repetitive grunt work, fighting with terrible data formats from vendors and doing basic ETL.\n* To make it worse, the senior devs on the team have all managed to get themselves onto new, interesting projects, leaving me and other juniors to handle this \"data plumbing.\" Management is vague when I raise concerns. Changing teams isn't an option either.\n\nI feel that my passion for coding is gone, extinguished by this job. I feel miserable and am experiencing burnout symptoms. I have zero energy or interest in side projects or open source (which I was quite keen on before).\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Is this loss of passion just a temporary reaction to this specific job? Or is it a sign I'll just end up in another \"boredom -> misery\" cycle if I change jobs?\n2. Am I just being an entitled or lazy person who \"hates all work\"? The relatively decent salary makes me feel incredibly guilty for complaining.\n3. What's a viable path? Other quant firms, tech companies, crypto, or simply stop complaining and keep cleaning data?\n\nI feel like my career is stalling and I'm wasting my life. Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "content": "I’m 32, originally from Eastern Europe, and moved to the U.S. about ten years ago. I taught myself front-end development in 2017 while living off savings, and during that time I started using weed heavily to cope with stress. It turned into a long-term dependency. I’m not functional when high. My focus and code quality drop  and that has definitely slowed my growth. I’ve also struggled with anxiety and burnout cycles along the way.\n\nMy first job was rough: I was the only front-end dev, no mentorship, no code reviews, just figuring things out alone. Since then, I’ve mostly worked in digital agencies doing CMS-heavy work. I’ve stayed employed and I can ship features, but I feel like my foundational skills never solidified. **My code works, but the quality often isn’t good** it feels like I’m assembling things rather than understanding them at a deeper level (architecture, state management, patterns, testing, etc.).\n\nOn top of that, **my career progression has been slow and has gaps field with very questionable freelance work.** Some people move from junior to senior/tech lead in 3–4 years. In my case, after \\~7–8 years, I’ve only just reached mid-level. I know why — lack of mentorship, inconsistent learning habits, mental health struggles, and the weed dependency but it still leaves me with the fear of becoming *stuck* or even **unemployable** if I don’t level up soon.\n\nI’m trying to cut down on weed, rebuild discipline, and take my growth seriously. But I’m overwhelmed and unsure how to structure the path.\n\n**I’d really appreciate advice on:**\n\n1. **How to improve code quality** when you didn’t develop good habits early on?\n2. **How to rebuild fundamentals mid-career** — patterns, architecture, testing — in a structured way?\n3. **How to break out of the “just making things work” mindset** and develop more intention in coding?\n4. **For anyone who has dealt with weed dependence / burnout:** what helped you actually regain clarity and momentum?\n5. **How to focus** when everything feels important and the learning path feels endless?\n\nNot looking for pity, just experiences from people who’ve been through similar and found a way to turn things around.\n\nThanks to anyone who takes the time to reply.",

The work is also technically complex, which is appealing.\n\nMy main hesitation is location — I’ve been in the Bay Area for ~1.5 years, but I really want to move to NYC, where most of my friends and family are. I can see my social life improving drastically there.\n\n\nOption A – Take the Robinhood offer\n\n- Location: Menlo Park (Bay Area) — I really wanted NYC\n\n- Pay: ~10% increase from LinkedIn\n\n- Equity: Better long-term upside than Microsoft/LinkedIn, but possible short-term downside\n\n- Career growth: Likely stronger (faster-paced team, more technical scope)\n\n- Mobility: Can’t change location while on the same team — I’d need an internal transfer to move to NYC\n\n- Promotion policy: Must stay at least 1 year in a role before being eligible (regardless of total experience)\n\n- So realistically, I’d be in the Bay for at least a year before I could transfer or get promoted (IC3 → IC4 after ~2.5 YOE)\n\n- Promotion timelines at LinkedIn are similar anyway\n\n\nOption B – Stay at LinkedIn\n- I could ask the recruiter to pause my Robinhood application and reopen it in January to see if any NYC teams open up (not guaranteed)\n\n- In the meantime, I’d stay at LinkedIn, though I’m feeling stagnant and unmotivated\n\n- LinkedIn has better WLB and is easy to coast at (though that may hurt long-term growth)\n\n- I could also interview for other NYC roles in early 2025, but the prep/interview grind is taxing and affects my current job performance\n\n\nPriorities (in order)\n\n\t1.Long-term career growth\n\n\t2.Being in NYC\n\n\t3.Compensation / equity\n\n\t4.Work-life balance\n\n\nRobinhood would push my career forward technically, but I’d have to stay in Menlo Park for at least a year working on a product I’m only moderately excited about.\n\nStaying at LinkedIn feels stagnant, but gives me flexibility to pursue NYC roles sooner — though that path is uncertain.\n\nWould you:\n- Take the Robinhood offer as a growth move, stick it out in the Bay for a year, then try to transfer to NYC or pivot externally?\nor\n\n- Decline and wait to reapply in January for potential NYC roles (and keep searching in the meantime)",

        "author": "HYV_Empathy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For context, I'm 27m and I used to work as a team lead for high-level FE development (HTML/JS/CSS only work, basically). My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.\n\nAbout 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.\n\nPerfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.\n\nGoing from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.\n\nLately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.\n\nWe use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it. I keep trying to investigate issues, get stuck, reach out to a colleague only for them to say \"Oh, that's likely due to xyz\" when \"xyz\" never even crossed my mind.\n\nIt feels like I've been plateaued for months now, and I can't get past it. I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of \"When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology.\" along with \"Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.\"\n\nThis advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of. If I see \"Axios error 123\" or \"Apollo error: this is what's wrong...\" then brilliant! I can read the documentation!\n\nBut for more vague issues like \"This is our component that's nested in 13 other components, it's not working as intended, figure out why.\" I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).\n\nWhat I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.\n\nLately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to \"Acute stress reaction\" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.\n\nIt doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.\n\nI just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?\n\nP.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day. I wonder if that's relevant... /s",

I was blessed to work with technologies like Kubernetes, AWS, Azure DevOps, Argo and opportunities to work on big projects. \n\nThen I got laid off. At the same time, bunch of people in my life passed away. I've been depressed and turned off from tech for a year now. Meaning no studying leetcode or interview prep. Also blessed to be sitting on a stack of savings. \n\nI just picked up a seasonal retail position at Best Buy to get my ass out of the house and into gear by interacting with other people. I haven't used any of my network bc I know I'm not ready to interview yet. \n\nBut I would love some advice on where to get started in this market. I'm prepared for awful rejections and ready to answer about my time off. I'm planning on taking some beginner courses to refresh my memory on code. My plan right now:\n\nWeekly Study:\n- Leetcode\n- Systems Design\n- Work on certifications (not sure which as idk if I want to stay in DevOps)\n- courses on Python/Java/SQL\n- STAR/interview prep \n\nI guess I want to know how does this look? Anything to add? How do you stay motivated during this time? What would you say about a year+ off if asked in an interview? \n\nSorry for all the questions. Appreciate any answers! ",

I recently found out I have ADHD (its not a simple diagnosis, but that's what I'll say for brevity).\n\nRecently (before I got this confirmed) I told my boss that I do my best work when I am allowed to focus on one task at a time and can hyperfocus on a single feature. He said that he understood, but in the last year or so I keep getting shifted off projects and I am not able to acclimate myself to a single workflow.\n\n* Before this I was doing OS automated testing in Python with Pytest.\n* I was switched to a new team which does Python testing with Squish. So I was brought up to speed on that.\n* One of the other testers introduced a new way to run our automated tests through Jenkins. So I was brought up to speed on that and got a Jenkins pipeline we as testers could deploy from for verifying changes we did to our branches before merging to master. Eventually having to update existing tests because they were having issues running through Jenkins.\n* There was some drama from management and the testers on workflows. Not going into it, but it led to a lot of flip flopping between the old and new workflows.\n* The last PI there was a high priority project that needed assistance and I was told to assist for 6 weeks on manually running complex test scenarios that hadn't been automated yet.\n* I feel adrift, useless, and unproductive. I cannot focus and I am still trying to find ADHD techniques to focus but am having trouble finding one that works.\n\nI don't know what is happening, I was good at my job up until COVID and now I feel as though I am worse than when I was entry level. I have a massive headache and my brain feels like its trying to escape my skull because of the anxiety.\n\nEdit: I am getting medication.",

I worked in tech in the US, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and visited China many times for work.\n\nTo various extents, I've seen the the development of AI, dot-com bubble (indirectly), big data boom, cloud revolution, the Bitcoin inception, the LLMs, and a few side-hypes like the quantum computing.\n\nI'm also well-aware of the overall crisis of science, especially with respect to publishing and funding, that spans far beyond the boundaries of Computer Science. Nevertheless, I would argue that no major scientific discipline is in a worse danger than CS, and I'm proceeding to expand on that.\n\nTech has generated an unprecedented amount of wealth over the last three decades. That wealth produced the political power that influenced the society. Unlike some other historically influential movements, this one chose an unsubtle method of societal influence that generates unprecedented amount of discontent, and therefore I denote the people who hold this power as \"moguls.\" Worse even for the tech community, the moguls hid their ideological underpinnings and political ambitions behind their \"tech nerd\" images.   \n  \nHistory teaches us that the majority of the upcoming backlash will center around the images the moguls perpetuate and not their chosen ideologies.   \n  \nAlthough one could argue that a scientific or engineering discipline may spontaneously evaporate upon fulfilling its historical role, I assume that CS is not at that stage. That is to say that there still exist problems that CS can help humanity with.\n\nUnder the above assumption, how do we defend CS (and tech) as a discipline once the \"shit hits the fan,\" pardon my French? How do we argue that it's not tech that is evil, but the ideologies fueling the tech moguls?",

I’m pursuing Senior SWE position(s). Through my recruiter screening and technical phone parts, I believe I’ve shown that I’m technically strong, and I think they know through my introductions that I haven’t mentored or led projects. That’s why I’m curious about what expectations I should anticipate when speaking with the hiring manager.\n\nThis market is tough, so I’m taking all the help I can get. I’m self-aware that socializing isn’t my strongest skill. In past hiring processes for SWE II roles, I tended to succeed at companies that emphasized LeetCode-style technical assessments. But at places where the behavioral portion carried weight, I often fell short—partly because I optimized only for the technical side.\n\nNow I’m focused on building strong behavioral stories. I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.\n\nOverall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager. I’m willing to invest significant time into this preparation since acing the behavioral round feels like a fixed cost in today’s market",

It can be very stressful at times with the workload, since we're a small company and we manage many clients, and the pay isn't too great, but I'm really enjoying the experience. I'm learning a lot, and especially in this economy, I'm SO grateful to be working this job.\n\nThing is, though, I know I can be replaced, and that's never gonna change no matter what I do, but what would you guys recommend I do to make myself slightly less replaceable? I've already been told about the areas in which I'm lacking performance-wise, so I'm gonna lock in and try to stay on top of everything and do the best I can. My company also offers reimbursement for passing exams like CCCNA and Security+, which I'm definitely going to take advantage of when I get more schoolwork out of the way, because that's kind of the direction I want to go anyway. \n\nI already have some experience part-time tech support somewhere else, but it took me almost two years of working freelance and warehouse since then to get offered this IT position, and I'm very worried about layoffs and whatnot. What can I do to try and solidify myself in this industry and ease my mind a little bit? I know nothing's impossible and even the most qualified people are getting screwed over, but any effort helps.

For reference, I am a data engineer in the semi-conductor industry, and the number of times that I have worked on a project only to:\n\n1. Get held up by permissions and access constantly, and have to submit an IT ticket that gets put on the back burner for weeks.\n\n2. Find out that I need to use the approved by IT tools/resources which are often completely ass and hold no real world value, and hinder progress, because people making these decisions are looking at safety and budget, not actual function. Looking at you Power Automate flow, the worst platform I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life… all because my company won’t allow anyone not directly on the software team to create an actual web application outside of Power App and Power automate flow.\n\n3. Deal with management misunderstanding priorities and getting caught up on their grandiose visions of ML/AI which is just literally a buzz word at this point and they have no understanding of what is actually meant by these words. I had a boss that wanted me, by myself, to implement a way to monitor FSE’s , with AI, who are working on the tool to ensure they’re installing the parts outlined in procedures… sir… what?! He pressed us to do this for months despite telling him it isn’t attainable, and he just kept saying, “figure it out.” Until finally he left the he company.\n\n4. Management or stakeholders who want a detailed, image based, representation of every single change you accidentally mention instead of just making discretely. I had a manager for a while who, for example, in one meeting I mentioned I have to change the data type of a column on my not even proof of concept project yet, and he had me spend 6 days making DAGs, picture based PowerPoints, and tons of other documentation, because he wanted to understand better… this was a guy who bragged about lying on his resume to get a tech job management position and was previously just monitoring processes and creating tickets when processes failed for wafer runs in the fab…. Needless to say, he was shortly thereafter demoted lol.\n\nAnd so many other things.\n\nThe point is, exercise, go for walks, meditate, or some thing else to build resilience and clear your mind, and learn patience, because the biggest thing I have learned in the last 3-4 years in this industry is that you will run into so many absurd issues or requests that are in no way based in logic, and are purely emotional, and if you let it eat at you, it’s going to destroy your mental health, work relationships, etc.\n\nGodspeed y’all. \n\nEdit: I also want to emphasize, I am so grateful to have a job, I love my company, I love the management that I have most of the time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have worked here for 10 years now. I understand things could be significantly worse and I could be on tour in the infantry or something. I just wanted to touch on something that I think affects many people in this industry and they don’t get credit for it.",
