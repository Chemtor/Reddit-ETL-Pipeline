I am also studying Software Engineering at the moment.\n\nI've been working in isolated environments for the past 3 years which prevents me from using modern cloud platforms. Most of my time in DE has been on the platform side, not the data side. \n\nSince I joined the field, DevOps, MLOPs, LLMs, RAG and Data Lakehouse have been added to our responsibility on top of the old Modern Data Stack and Data Warehouses. This stack covers all of the use cases I have faced so far. \n\nThese are my current recommendations for each of those problems in a self hosted, open source environment (with the exception of vibe coding, I haven't found any model good enough to do so yet). You don't need all of these tools, but you could use them all if you needed to. Solve the problems you have with the minimum tools you can. \n\nI have been working on guides on how to deploy the stack in docker/kubernetes on my site, [www.datacraftsman.com.au](http://www.datacraftsman.com.au), but not all of them are finished yet... I've been vibe coding data engineering tools instead as it's a fun distraction. \n\nI hope these resources help you make a better decision with your architecture.\n\nComment below if you have any advice on improving the stack with reasons why, need any help setting up the tools or want to understand my choices and I'll try my best to help.",

No demo, just bold claims in a post.\n\nWe tried to set realistic expectations and even did a demo to show how it actually works. Unsurprisingly, when you connect GenAI to tables without any context, metadata, or table descriptions, it spits out bad SQL, hallucinates, and confidently shows completely wrong data.\n\nAnd of course... drum roll... it’s our fault. Because apparently we “can’t do it like that guy on LinkedIn.”\n\nI’m not saying this stuff isn’t possible—it is—but it’s a project. There’s no magic switch. If you want good results, you need to describe your data, inject context, define business logic, set boundaries… not just connect and hope for miracles.\n\nHow do you deal with this kind of crap? When influencers—who clearly don’t understand the tech deeply—start shaping stakeholder expectations more than the actual engineers and data people who’ve been doing this for years?\n\nMaybe I’m just pissed, but this hype wave is exhausting. It's making everything harder for those of us trying to do things right.",

I work sometimes 12+ hours a day including weekends and it feels no matter how hard I play 'catch up' there's still neverending work that I never truly felt caught up. I feel dissapointed honestly, I hoped my current job would help me land somewhere more in the engineering space after working in analytics for so long but my job ultimately makes me feel like I will never be able to escape all the annoyingness that comes with working in analytics or data science in general.\n\nMy ideal job would be another more technical DE role, backend engineering or platform engineering within the same general domain area - I do not have a formal CS background.

All you need is one binary. After ingesting data via [sling](https://docs.slingdata.io), I found querying to be quite responsive (due to the SQL catalog backend). with Iceberg, querying can be quite sluggish, and you can't even query with SQL without some heavy engine like spark or trino.\n\nOf course, Iceberg has the advantage of being more established in the industry, with a longer track record, but I'm rooting for ducklake.

        "content": "To provide measurable benchmarks, there is a need for standardized tasks and challenges that each participant can perform and solve. While these comparisons may not capture all differences, they offer a useful understanding of performance speed. For this purpose, Coiled / Dask have introduced a challenge where data warehouse engines can benchmark their reading and aggregation performance on a dataset of 1 trillion records. This dataset contains temperature measurement data spread across 100,000 files. The data size is around 2.4TB.\n\n**The challenge**\n\n“Your task is to use any tool(s) you’d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3: s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also generate the data yourself.”\n\n**The Result**\n\nThe Apache Impala community was eager to participate in this challenge. For Impala, the code snippets required are quite straightforward — just a simple SQL query. Behind the scenes, all the parallelism is seamlessly managed by the Impala Query Coordinator and its Executors, allowing complex processes to happen effortlessly in a parallel way.\n\n**Article**\n\nhttps://itnext.io/the-one-trillion-row-challenge-with-apache-impala-aae1487ee451?source=friends_link&sk=eee9cc47880efa379eccb2fdacf57bb2\n\n**Resources**\n\nThe query statements for generating the data and executing the challenge are available at \nhttps://github.com/boroknagyz/impala-1trc",

We have an S3 end-point in the VPC to avoid egress costs.\n\nThat script calls script: `scripts/mount_nvme_aws.sh` which creates a RAID 0 storage array from the local NVMe disks - creating a single volume that has: 11.4TB in storage.\n\nWe launched the GizmoSQL Docker container using `scripts/run_gizmosql_aws.sh` \\- which includes the AWS S3 CLI utilities (so we can copy data, etc.).\n\nWe then copied the S3 data from `s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc/` to the local NVMe RAID 0 array volume - using attached script: `scripts/copy_coiled_data_from_s3.sh` \\- and it used: 2.3TB of the storage space. This copy step took: 11m23.702s (costing $2.78 on-demand, and $0.54 spot).\n\nWe then launched GizmoSQL via the steps after the docker stuff in: `scripts/run_gizmosql_aws.sh` \\- and connected remotely from our laptop via the Arrow Flight SQL JDBC Driver - (see repo: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql) for details) - and ran this SQL to create a view on top of the parquet datasets:\n\n    CREATE VIEW measurements_1trc\n    AS\n    SELECT *\n      FROM read_parquet('data/coiled-datasets-rp/1trc/*.parquet');\n    \n\nRow count:\n\nWe then ran the test query:\n\n    SELECT station, min(measure), max(measure), avg(measure)\n    FROM measurements_1trc\n    GROUP BY station\n    ORDER BY station;\n    \n\nIt took: 0:02:22 (142s) the first execution (cold-start) - at an EC/2 on-demand cost of: $0.56, and a spot cost of: $0.11\n\nIt took: 0:02:09 (129s) the second execution (warm-start) - at an EC/2 on-demand cost of: $0.51, and a spot cost of: $0.10\n\nSee: [https://github.com/coiled/1trc/issues/7](https://github.com/coiled/1trc/issues/7) for scripts, etc.\n\nSide note:  \nQuery: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM measurements_1trc;` takes: 21.8s",

This pipeline uses AI agents (orchestrated with LangChain/LangGraph and powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to:\n\n* **Plan** data transformation strategies.\n* **Generate** production-ready PySpark code.\n* **Review** the generated code for quality and correctness.\n* **Execute** transformations across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.\n* Crucially, **self-correct** by revising code and retrying in case of errors.\n\nIt aims for a truly zero-touch, self-healing data flow, with integrated observability via LangSmith.\n\nAs a CS undergrad, this is my first significant venture into building a comprehensive data transformation agent like this. I've learned a ton about integrating LLMs with data platforms.\n\nI'd be incredibly grateful if you seasoned data engineers could check it out.

Jupyter notebooks and the whole DS package, to completely and finally document the data pipeline _and the data quality_, before the data analysts can lay their eyes on the data. And at that point it's considered a failure if I need to make some change. \n\nI feel like this is very waterfall like, and slows us down, because they could have gotten the data much faster if I don't have to spend time doing basically what they should be doing either way, and probably will do again. If there was a genuine intentional feedback loop between us, we could move much faster than what were doing. But now it's considered failure if an adjustment is needed or an additional column must be added etc after the pipeline is documented, which must be completed before they will touch the data.\n\nI actually don't mind doing data analysis on a personal level, but it's weird that a data starved data science team doesn't want more data and sooner, and do this analysis themselves?",

        "content": "Hopefully this is the correct subreddit. Not sure where else to ask. \n\nPremise: So our application has a requirement from the C-suite executives to be active-active. The goal for this discussion is to understand whether Mongo or Postgres makes the most sense to achieve that. \n\nBackground: It is a containerized microservices application in EKS. Currently uses Oracle, which we’ve been asked to stop using due to license costs. Currently it’s single region but the requirement is to be multi region (US east and west) and support multi master DB.\n\nDetails: Without revealing too much sensitive info, the application is essentially an order management system. Customer makes a purchase, we store the transaction information, which is also accessible to the customer if they wish to check it later. \n\nUser base is 15 million registered users. DB currently had ~87TB worth of data. \n\nThe schema looks like this. It’s very relational. It starts with the Order table which stores the transaction information (customer id, order id, date, payment info, etc). An Order can have one or many Items. Each Item has a Destination Address. Each Item also has a few more one-one and one-many relationships. \n\nMy 2-cents are that switching to Postgres would be easier on the dev side (Oracle to PG isn’t too bad) but would require more effort on that DB side setting up pgactive, Citus, etc. And on the other hand switching to Mongo would be a pain on the dev side but easier on the DB side since the shading and replication feature pretty much come out the box. \n\nI’m not an experienced architect so any help, advice, guidance here would be very much appreciated. \n\n\n",

I was reflecting on what else my degree could be useful for, and I did a lot of data analytics and visualization, with a close friend of mine who was a math major just landing a very well paying Analytics job. This genuinely has me thinking of going back for MS in some data-related field.\n\nIf you think this is a good idea, what programs/schools/masters do you recommend?

Can I do it with SQLAlchemy taking a Polars dataframe as an input?\n\nThe complete data pipeline looks like this:\n- read in flat file (xlsx/CSV/JSON) with Polars\n- perform some data wrangling operations with Polars\n- upsert data to SQL Server (with table operation 'Create table if not exists')\n\nWhat I also found in a Stackoverflow post regarding Upserts with Polars:\n\n```\ndf1 = (     df_new     .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"inner\")     .select(df_new.columns) )  df2 = (     df_new     .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") )  df3 = (     df_old     .join(df_new, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") )  df_all = pl.concat([df1, df2, df3])\n```\n\nOr with `pl.update()` I could perform an Upsert inside Polars:\n\n```\ndf.update(new_df, left_on=[\"A\"], right_on=[\"C\"], how=\"full\")\n```\n\nWith both options though, I would have to read in the respective table from the database first, perform the Upsert with Polars and then write the output to the database again. This feels like 'overkill' to me?...\n\nAnyways, thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!\n\n",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI apologize if this isn't the right spot to ask but I'm feeling like I'm in a needle in a haystack situation and was hoping one of you might have that huge magnet that I'm lacking.\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nHow viable is a BI approach without an extra analytics database?  \nSource -> BI Tool\n\n\n\nLonger version:\n\nComing from being \"the excel guy\" I've recently been promoted to analytics engineer (whether or not that's justified is a discussion for another time and place).\n\nMy company's reporting was entirely build upon me accessing source systems like our ERP and CRM through SQL directly and feeding that into Excel via power query.\n\nDue to growth in complexity and demand this isn't a sustainable way of doing things anymore, hence me being tasked with BI-ifying that stuff.\n\nNow, it's been a while (read \"a decade\") since the last time I've come into contact with dimensional modeling, kimball and data warehousing.\n\nBut that's more or less what I know or rather I can get my head around, so naturally that's what I proposed to build.\n\nOur development team is seeing things differently saying that storing data multiple times would be unacceptable and with the amount of data we have performance wouldn't be either.\n\nThey propose to build custom APIs for the various source systems and feeding those directly into whatever BI tool we choose (we are 100% on-prem so powerBI is out of the race, tableau is looking good rn).\n\nAnd here is where I just don't know how to argue. How valid is their point? Do we even need a data warehouse (or lakehouse and all those fancy things I don't know anything about)?\n\nOne argument they had was that BI tools come with their own specialized \"database\" that is optimized and much faster in a way we could never build it manually.\n\nBut do they really? I know Excel/power query has some sort of storage, same with powerBI but that's not a database, right?\n\nI'm just a bit at a loss here and was hoping you actual engineers could steer me in the right direction.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on a project where I'm building a pipeline to organize, analyze, and visualize experimental data from different batches. The goal is to help my team more easily view and compare historical results through an interactive web app.\n\nRight now, all the experiment data is stored as CSVs in a shared data lake, which allows for access control, only authorized users can view the files. Initially, I thought it’d be better to load everything into a database like PostgreSQL, since structured querying feels cleaner and would make future analytics easier. So I tried adding a batch_id column to each dataset and uploading everything into Postgres to allow for querying and plotting via the web app. But since we don’t have a cloud SQL setup, and loading all the data into a local SQL instance for new user every time felt inefficient, I didn’t go with that approach.\n\nThen I discovered DuckDB, which seemed promising since it’s SQL-based and doesn’t require a server, and I could just keep a database file in the shared folder. But now I’m running into two issues: 1) Streamlit takes a while to connect to DuckDB every time, and 2) the upload/insert process is for some reason troublesome and need to take more time to maintain schema and structure etc.\n\nSo now I’m stuck… in a case like this, is it even worth loading all the CSVs into a database at all? Should I stick with DuckDB/SQL? Or would it be simpler to just use pandas to scan the directory, match file names to the selected batch, and read in only what’s needed? If so, would there be any issues with doing analytics later on? \n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s built a similar visualization pipeline — any advice or thoughts would be super appreciated!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL Debezium CDC connectors as of now. As per my understanding, the reason MongoDB and PostgreSQL connectors need the heartbeat mechanism is that both MongoDB and PostgreSQL notify the connector of the changes in the subscribed collections/tables (using MongoDB change streams and PostgreSQL publications) and if no changes happen in the collections/tables for a long time, the connector might not receive any activity corresponding to the subscribed collections/tables. In case of MongoDB, that might lead to losing the token and in case of PostgreSQL, it might lead to the replication slot getting bigger (if there are changes happening to other non-subscribed tables/databases in the cluster).\n\n  \nNow, as far as I understand, MySQL Debezium connector (or any CDC connector) reads the binlog files, filters for the records pertaining to the subscribed table and writes those records to, say, Kafka. MySQL doesn't notify the client (in this case the connector) of changes to the subscribed tables. So the connector shouldn't need a heartbeat. Even if there's no activity in the table, the connector should still read the binlog files, find that there's no activity, write nothing to Kafka and commit till when it has read. Why is the heartbeat mechanism required for MySQL CDC connectors? I am sure there is a gap in my understanding of how MySQL CDC connectors work. It would be great if someone could point out what I am missing.\n\n  \nThanks for reading.",

He wasn't too specific when describing it to me.\n\nI’m comfortable with basic Python, but still learning most of the other tools. This past week I’ve been self-studying Bash, but haven't really touched on the rest of the technologies he said I might use. I have \\~2 weeks until my start and \\~2 hours maybe more each day to learn.\n\nIf anyone has experience with internships like this, I’d love advice on:\n\n* What kind of tasks I should expect as a junior/HS-level intern in DevOps/Data Science. Also not really sure how experienced they think I am lol\n   * Are they expecting me to learn these technologies beforehand like I am doing?\n* What skills should I absolutely know vs. what I can learn on the fly\n* How to make a good impression when I’m a *lot* less experienced than everyone else\n* How to ask for help without sounding incompetent or annoying them\n* Any specific prep/resources you recommend in the next couple weeks\n* Etiquette in general\n\nAppreciate any advice.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently helping a client in the financial sector to design two separate data platforms that deliver reports to their end clients, primarily banks.\n\n1. Cloud Platform: Built on Google Cloud, using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the data lake and BigQuery as the main analytics engine.\n2. On Premise Platform: Based on S3 compatible object storage, with Apache Iceberg for table format management and Trino as the SQL query engine.\n\nIn both setups, we're using dbt as the core tool for data modelling and transformation.\n\nThe hybrid approach is mainly driven by data sovereignty concerns, not all banking clients are comfortable with their data being stored or processed in the cloud. That said, this reluctance may not be permanent. Some clients currently on the on-premise platform may eventually request migration to the cloud.\n\nIn this context, portability and smooth migration between the two platforms is a design priority. The internal data architect's strategy is to maintain identical ingestion pipelines data model across both platforms. This design allows client migrations to be managed by simply filtering their data out of the on premise platform and filtering it in on the cloud platform, without the need for major changes to pipelines or data structures.\n\nAn important implication of this approach, and something that raises questions for me, is that every change made to the data model in one platform must be immediately applied to the other. In theory, using dbt should ease this process by centralizing data transformations, but I still wonder how to properly handle the differences in SQL implementations across both platforms.\n\nCurious to hear from others who have tackled this kind of hybrid architectures. Beyond SQL dialect differences, are there other major pitfalls I should be anticipating with this hybrid setup? Any best practices or architectural patterns you would recommend?",

        "content": "Hi everyone...I am here just to ask guy few things, I hope you guys will help resolve some of the doubts that I have. \n\nSo I have been working as SQL Server Dba for last 2 years for a service based company and I am currently part of the dba team which caters to atleast 8-10 clients simultaneously. Most of my work is monitoring work with ocassional high level stuff, otherwise most of the time I get like L1 level tasks. Since we cater to multiple clients therefore I had the opportunity to get in touch with other databases like MySQL and Oracle. I also work in AWS cloud, mainly we work with RDS, S3 for backups and EC2 instances where DB instances are installed. We work in rotational shifts which is the least favorite part of the job me. \n\nI got DBA role as a chance to enter to corporate and specially the data field, but I really don't like the DBA role, because I have seen the kind of time this role demands from you. I have seen my manager even working weekends sometimes due to some client activity or doing some POC for potential client. Plus the rotational shift I just hate it, I have endured for 2 years but I don't think so I will be able to endure for another year or two. \n\nI have been working remotely for last 2 years Therefore I had plenty of time to upskill myself and learn technologies like SQL Server, AWS Cloud (Mainly Database related tasks), L1 administration of MySQL and Oracle. Apart from that I have also invested time in learning Python which I like a lot, I had also invested a lot time in learning SQL too. Earlier I was learning web dev along job thinking that I could transition from DBA to dev, but I realised that both are very different roles and whatever I have learnt here as a DBA won't do me that good in dev role. Therefor I have decided to further transition into DE role. \n\nI have made a plan of the things that I will have to learn for DE role and also a plan to double down on things I already know. Mostly I want to focus on Azure ecosystem for DE and for That I have decided to learn SQL, Azure Data Factory - ADF - ETL, Databricks, Python, Spark - PySpark, Azure Synapse Analytics. I am already familiar with SQL and Python as mentioned before, and just need to take care of the other things. \n\nI just want to know from you guys is this even possible? Or am I just stuck with DBA role forever? Is my plan even relevant and doable or not? \n\nI have come to hate rotational shift and specially the night shifts so much that made my hate for DBA role even more greater. I am just looking for opinions, what do you guys think?\n\nAzure Devops",

        "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nNeed some advice on below process. Wanted to know if anybody has encountered this weird behaviour snowflake.\n\nScenario 1 :- The Kafka Stream\n\nwe have a kafka stream running on a snowflake permanent table, which runs a put command to upload the csv files to table stage and then runs a copy command which unloads the data into the table. And then a RM command to remove the files from table stage.\n\norder of execution :- PUT to table\\_1 stage >> copy to table\\_1 >> RM to remove table\\_1 stage file.\n\nAll the above mentioned steps are handled by kafka of course :)\n\nAnd as expected this runs fine, no rows missed during the process.\n\n  \nScenario 2:- The batch load\n\nSometimes we need to do i batch load onto the same table, just in case of the kafka stream failure.\n\nwe have a custom application to select and send out the batch file for loading. But below is the over all process via our custom application.\n\nPut file to snowflake named stage >> copy command to unload the file to table\\_1.\n\nNote :- in our scenario we want to load batch data into the same table where the kafka stream is running.  \n\n\nThis batch load process only works fine when the kafka stream is turned off on the table. All the rows from the files gets loaded fine.\n\nBut here is the catch, once the kafka stream is turned on the table, if we try to load the batch file it doesnt just load at all.\n\nI have checked the query history and copy history.And found out another weird behaviour. It says the copy command has been run successfully and loaded around 1800 records into the table. But the file that we had uploaded had 57k. Even though it says it had loaded 1800 rows, those rows are nowhere to be found in the table.\n\n  \nHas anyone encountered this issue? I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal. But i dont understand this behaviour of snowflake. Couldn't find anything on the documentation either.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\n\nHey folks,\n\nWe're currently planning to deploy an on-premise big data cluster using Kubernetes. Our core stack includes MinIO, Apache Spark, probably Trino, some Scheduler for backend/compute as well as Jupyter + some web based SQL UI as front ends.\n\nHere’s where I’m hitting a roadblock: table management, especially as we scale. We're expecting a ton of Delta tables, and I'm unsure how best to track where each table lives and whether it's in Hive, Delta, or Iceberg format.\n\nI was thinking of introducing Hive Metastore (HMS) as a central point of truth for all table definitions, so both analysts and data engineers can rely on it when interacting with Spark. But honestly, the HMS documentation feels pretty thin, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something—or maybe even looking at the wrong solution altogether.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n- How do you manage table definitions and data location metadata in your stack?\n- If you’re using Hive Metastore, how do you handle IAM and access control?\n\nWould really appreciate your insights or battle-tested setups!\n",

But the moment I began typing, I blanked out. I couldn’t recall even the basic syntax of JavaScript or Python. I could hear their laughter in my own head, even though no one mocked me directly. It was deeply embarrassing.\n\nIn that moment, I started questioning my skills and every decision that brought me here. I’ve built several projects, some quite complex, like an image size compressor but none of that mattered when I failed to write a basic loop. Maybe it was the nerves, or maybe I just froze under pressure. I’m not entirely sure.\n\nI don’t know if it’s appropriate to share this here, but I felt the need to. This experience shook me.

Request and response bodies must be sent and received in JSON format.\n\nDevelop as diligently as you would when creating software in real-world scenarios.\n\nRules\nThe game follows the familiar principle: a player tries their luck at the machine and pulls the lever. One game costs 3 credits. The machine has three reels, each displaying either an apple, a banana, or a clementine. If all three reels show the same fruit, the player wins. The following payouts apply depending on the fruit:\n- 3 apples: 10 credits\n- 3 bananas: 15 credits\n- 3 clementines: 20 credits\n\nA player can deposit money or withdraw it.\n\nOptional Requirements\nIf there is still enough time available, you can implement the following optional requirement:\nThe player can increase their bet for a game. If they win, they are rewarded with more credits in proportion to the risk they took.\n```\n\nNow I got an E-Mail saying:\n> You brought a lot to the table in terms of personality and as a consultant, but unfortunately, the technical aspect didn’t quite meet their expectations.\n\nCan you tell me why I failed?\n- [The Repo](https://github.com/xtay2/one-armed-bandit)\n- [The Docs](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtay2/one-armed-bandit/refs/heads/master/docs/api-v1.yaml)\n\nEDIT: On the branch `feat/database` is also a version using PostgreSQL as persistent data storage.\n\nEDIT 2: Added the optional requirement(s).\n\nEDIT 3:\nI asked them if I should provide persistence & auth, but they responded saying:\n\n> The task doesn't have explicit requirements for persistence or user management. \"dillegence\" refers more to quality and care than to going beyond the requirements.\n\n> At the same time, we chose the task so that it can be completed in a manageable amount of time. The described requirements set a framework for what the solution should be able to do, but within that, you decide what you think is appropriate and what isn’t. One goal of the kata is to later talk with you about your decisions, understand your reasoning, and have a relaxed conversation about it. So there's no \"right\" or \"wrong.\"\n\n> With that in mind: decide for yourself. Whatever your decision is, you should be able to justify it.\n\n---\n\n### I got my feedback!\nTwo days ago, I hopped on a call with two senior devs in the company. They told me that they designed the test to find people that \"fit their spirit\", so that, \"if we go into a project on day two, everyone has the same mentality\".\n\nProblems they named and reasons they gave:\n- I didn't generate my controllers with the open-api spec.\n- I didn't explain __why__ I implemented the `CreditStoreService#transaction` method the way I did.\n- My tests are not connected to the open-api spec.\n- My tests use `@Order`-Annotations.\n\nAs I explained my reasoning for these deliberate decisions, they listened to me and told me my motives were valid. They just do it another way. As I then said that it's impossible to get these criteria right because they are not a part of the task, they said that they hope for a candidate who is \"a lucky hit\".\n\nThe rest of the meeting was just an awkward talk, where we all came to the conclusion that this is not a good criterion for hiring, they agreed, but said the decision was already made. 🤷🏻‍♂️",

But sometimes I open a class doc and it just… feels endless. So many properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, mixins, parameters, and I’m like:\n\n\"Wait… what do I actually need to look at right now?\"\n\nI often just search for what I need in the moment, but then I get this weird FOMO (fear of missing out), like maybe I’m ignoring something really useful that I’ll need later.\nAt the same time, reading everything seems impossible and draining.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nHow do you personally approach big documentation pages?\n\nDo you just read what’s relevant now?\n\nDo you take time to explore what else a class can do, even if you don’t need it yet?\n\nAnd if yes, how do you remember or organize what you saw for later?\n\n\nI guess I just feel like I should \"know everything\" and that pressure gets overwhelming. Would love to hear how others deal with this — especially devs who’ve been doing this for a while.\n\nThanks",

And at first while classes were technically over in highschool, I was first being productive towards my goal spending everyday coding this one project. I later became tired and fed up with my process that I moved onto another as a break of sorts. Then another. And another. And at this point, I haven’t coded in a while in two weeks or done anything productive. I’ve really just been getting into crochet to take off the pressure about contractual stuff and just focus on something else for the time being like making a sweater I saw from Pinterest for instance..\n\nI have about three projects which are unfinished and I promised myself especially about the portfolio website that I will finish it because I have been working on that since last December. Then again the reason why it took awhile was because of I was trying to figure out and decide what the UI would look just to avoid large frontend revisions. Anyways, any advice for managing projects? I really want to be able to finish these independently and especially at least one of these within the end of the summer. ",

        "content": "I started learning programming last month with the final intention of making my dream game (like every person ever that learns to program). Started with editing (see: copying code into and altering) a 3D character controller state machine for godot, was pretty proud that I got it so that the player couldn't uncrouch underneath something and adapted someone else's code to make a leaning system. Realized the 3D game idea was way way too outside of my skill set so I downgraded to 2D, worked on that a bit, got caught up making screenshot mockups cause I'm an artist, barely really coded anything but figured that this was still too hard for me probably. Tried making pong. Too hard. Finally I just ate my pride and said I'd shed the need of trying to learn to program and learn a game engine at the same time and now I'm making a text adventure game in python.\n\nThe reason I had my first win is cause I've had such a hard time coding anything by myself. I've always needed a tutorial and never come up with solutions on my own. I needed a bit of help to get this project rolling but overall but now I'm able to open up VS Code and work alone with googling and documentation reading. I made a really basic save system on my own! Came up with the problem, thought about it, and came to a solution on my own! It's far from robust or complex, there are probably a million better ways to do this but I did it by myself and I'd say it's reasonably complex considering I was having troubles coding a 2D character controller on my own.\n\nI've got a long way to go but I think this is a good ass win. Time to let my ego get to me and scope creep a choose your own adventure book.",

        "content": "*Im writing this as an all encompassing Praise / Gripe / Warning for others considering the appeal of using* [*Boot.dev*](http://Boot.dev) *to learn about backend dev.*\n\n>**THE PRAISE**\n\nFor learning actual code basics, ie Python / CLI / git, its been fantastic and well worth the money. The courses are very well put together and really make it easy and approachable to pick up and learn the foundational material. The community is exceptionally helpful, the AI tool for education theyve employed is very good at \"teaching\" you concepts without just flat providing the answers (very different from what the other AIs out there do), and you do feel as though you are progressing and learning as you go up in the subject matter.\n\n\n\n>**THE GRIPE**  \n*i say this as someone who did NOT have a coding background*\n\nAs you move along through the courses, especially once you hit the PyGame / Object Oriented Programming / Functional Programming areas, you will start to hit \"concept walls\" where you can't complete the answer just based on the information that's been previously provided. I've hit many moments, where feeling completely stumped on a lesson, that the core solve for it came from an understanding that was not reviewed in the previous \"internal\" materials, but existed as something that would have been \"understood\" if the user had some comp sci / programming background. It's just very frustrating at times to feel as though you've been paying attention to the materials and following along, only to suddenly hit a wall of knowledge and discover, \\[ no its designed to not be informed, so you have an urge to go out and find what you dont know \\]. Personally, if I'm paying for a service, I want the knowledge to be provided for learning, not that I have to go out externally elsewhere and hopefully discover it.  \n\n\n>**THE WARNING**\n\nContent will become SIGNIFICANTLY harder as you progress. The Discord is there and does help a lot in answer basic questions, and some more advanced ones; but it does genuinely feel as though the course materials are being written more for people who are already have familiarity with Comp Sci / Programming, **ie the core basics**, and then the later courses are meant to build on top of that wider external schooling and knowledge.  \n  \nThose that are there to assist, again all well meaning and wanting to be helpful, advise on how to solve for it as if they were speaking to other programmers who also are familiar with the code youre having trouble with. Like hearing 2 experts talk to each other trying to solve a problem, if youre not on the same level knowledge wise, it becomes more difficult to follow along on what theyre trying to advise on how to correct for.  \n\n\n>**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nThe service provided is INCREDIBLY well worth the cost... to a point depending on where you're starting from.  \nIf you have some code formal training / teaching, it probably is easier to follow along, but its openly stated that there is a teaching approach of not providing all the resources / guideposts for you to follow, and that you should go beyond the platform to find some answers.\n\n**For me, I have issue with that approach as a service I'm paying for to learn a subject matter on**  \n*but again, thats uniquely to me*\n\nI just want to share this to both promote the service, as I have been able to write functional python blurbs for solving my own small scale ideas and puzzles; but also as a warning that its VERY unlikely you can go into this, completely cold fresh and blind, and come out within 1 year as a trained backend dev with the full experience. \n\nI'll most likely renew my yearly membership for the platform, but there are hurdles that I now have to figure out the best way to learn-around instead of just beating my face into the wall as I have been for some problems.",

        "content": "Now, I've been working on JS pretty much since I started coding 3 years ago, and I really like the C-style syntax. The curly braces especially, semicolons make so much sense and when looking at Python code snippets it just looks so unnatural. Yet so many people SWEAR by how enjoyable it is to use. So, I want to ask, is it really?\n\nPython does look easy, but the indentation makes no sense to me and it honestly makes code more difficult to follow for me. I have no experience in Python so I may be VERY wrong. But personally, even though I can understand Python code to a good extent, the indentation just throws me off and makes reading nested code a HEADACHE for me because I have to take a hot second on each line to see where the indentation begins and ends. Now, this could all be because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but isn't the whole point of Python to be easy to read and understand? It is easy to read, I understand most code snippets out there, but the whole indentation thing is just so confusing to me. Is this a normal thing to say? Am I going crazy for questioning Python's readability? I'll still learn it some day, but I just wanted to ask whether anybody has ever felt this way and how they overcame it, because I don't want to get a headache every time I create an API.",

        "content": "I was a Java programmer with a solid knowledge of SQL from 2000 till about 2010 before I moved into management roles.  I also wrote two books on SQL back around Y2K.  \n\nWhen I joined my current company I was actually hoping to get to be more hands on again, but the reality was my role didn't call for it... until now.  Our new CTO wants dev managers to be more \"player coaches\".  So I am actually pretty keen about learning my stack which is primarily node.js, react and postgres based and API standards are important.\n\nSo my question is how best to efficiently learn the stack in 2025.  I will need to learn syntax, and I will need to learn mechanisms that I have not worked with before, eg: promises - as asynchronous programming was not prevalent when I was a programmer.  \n\nBack in the day, I learned very well reading good books - I remember a book about Java by Ivor Horton from WROX that I read back to front in a matter of days.  But I wouldn't say all books were of that level.  I even read all the IBM books on DB2 to learn the product and become strong on databases.\n\nOver the years I have dabbled with Udemy courses, but I find them far too inefficient to consume in video format in comparison to reading.  I did learn some concepts in React and Typescript syntax, but I never completed the courses because frankly they wouldn't have benefited my role at the time and I haven't really coded for fun in some time.\n\nI also tried an ACM membership where I got access to some Safari books as well as well as Pluralsight courses which were better I found than Udemy - but lacked much one the node.js front (perhaps limited by the ACM offering).  The Safari books were ok, but not necessarily that well written.\n\nI'm looking for what is likely to be the best path forward for me.  Appreciate any tips you can offer.",

That's (more or less) why we have the very popular rule of thumb in Python: multithreading for I/O-bound work, multiprocessing for CPU-bound work.\n\nAlso thank you to u/HQMorganstern for the more detailed explanation",

If so where should i take them?\n\nI've also been very interested in [Boot.Dev](http://Boot.Dev) \n\nHas anyone been able to land a job with the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) program? if not and i were to sign up for their program, would i be wasting my money by signing up for another online school to pass their accredited courses?\n\nThe reason i'm so interested in [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) is i have ADHD and i never knew about it until my 4th year of trade school.

Watching the channel grow over the years and gain millions of subscribers has been awesome.\n\nLately though, I’ve noticed that most of the content has been focused on AI, especially in the Code Report series. I totally understand why AI is huge right now, and those videos are pulling crazy numbers. But I kind of miss his older content, like the classic “100 Seconds of (Tech)” videos, the JavaScript survival guide, or Web Dev 101. That kind of content was gold, especially for new and intermediate devs or engineers trying to get a solid grip on different technologies quickly.\n\nIt does seem like Fireship is aware of this he even mentioned in the recent MCP tutorial video that it’s still a tutorial channel. So it’s nice to see that acknowledgment. And to be fair, even his newer videos still have that signature humor and creativity that made his channel stand out in the first place.\n\nOverall, I still really enjoy his channel and respect what he’s doing. It’s been a valuable resource for a lot of programmers, developers, engineers. Fireship has played a big role in making learning tech feel less intimidating and more fun, and that’s something I’ll always appreciate. ",

I get crazy brain fog while I’m watching the lecture (my digestion has been off lately so it might be a factor) which makes it nearly impossible to digest—no pun intended—some concepts from the course, such as functions and loops. It’s very hard not to let this obstacle convince me that coding is just not for me, but I can’t deny how this brain fog makes it extremely hard to focus and have mental clarity. As a side note, I’m also navigating a difficult situation in life and it’s bringing a lot of stress and frustration. \n\nHas anyone ever dealt with that? Any advice? How not to let this issue discourage you from continuing to learn… I’ve got a personal project I really want to work on, and the last thing I want to hear is that I won’t be able to make it 😔\n",

I searched a bit and I cam across an example that said that flags are just variables that control a loop. Like:\n\n`bool flag = true;`  \n`int loops = 0;`\n\n\n\n`while(flag)`  \n`{`  \n`++loops;`  \n`std::cout << “Current loop is: ” << loops << std::endl;`\n\n`if(loops > 10)`  \n`{`  \n`flag = false;`  \n`}`  \n`}`\n\n  \nIs it all what SDL\\_INIT\\_VIDEO is doing there? Just controling a loop inside the function? Since I can't see the SDL\\_INIT function definition (the documentation doesn't show it), I can only assume that there might be a loop inside it. ",

I used AI to help generate and structure some of the flashcards, but I made sure to review and refine everything by hand so it’s actually useful and not just noisy.\n\nThere’s also a blog section — I’ll be honest, part of the reason I added it was to help grow the site a bit and make it more friendly for things like AdSense. But I’ve tried to make sure the posts are genuinely helpful, not just filler.\n\nAnyway, it’s still a work in progress, but if you give it a try I’d love to know what you think or what’s missing. Happy to improve it based on real feedback.\n\nIt's available in both polish and english, however as most programming is done in english -> even for polish native I suggest you to use english version.\n\nThanks!",

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.\n\nThere's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice.   \nI want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.\n\nIn 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.\n\nOr maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until  things start to click - just like it was for the first time:)  \n  \nWhat's your view/advice?

        "content": "\nI am transferring to a new university in the fall and one of my major requirements is one class in the computer science category. The first option is an intro to statistics and probability course that I do not have the prerequisites to take, so thats not an option. The second option is an “intro” python based computational class. The third option is also a python based statistics class. The last option is an intro to computer programming class that I would prefer to take, but it doesn’t fit into my schedule. The professors for options 2 and 3 have horrible ratings (~1.8 on RMP) but they are the only options I can take. I have no experience in python and I am quite bad at math so I’m kind of stuck. I am currently enrolled in option 2 but I know it is going to be a struggle. I’m wondering if I should try to teach myself python basics before I get to school so I have a chance at passing (reviews mentioned the level of coding involved is not actually appropriate for an intro level class, and only students with previous experience were able to do well) or see if I can ask an advisor about finding an approved alternative course. Luckily my dad knows python so I can ask him for help on assignments and stuff so I won’t be completely lost if this class is my only option. \n\nWhat should I do? I really want to raise my GPA and I don’t want to risk failing a class I had no chance of passing in the first place. ",

The program would also read the file and even re-write it, and the data would be ordered by the time when it was calculated.\n\nAs I believe to understand, fstream read functions don't load the whole file into the ram, but if I want to remove parts and move everything back to \"fill in\" the space, it could lead to having to move very large amounts of data. \n\nWith separated files, that work would be reduced, specially if I put a header in the files that tells the \"Creation time\" of the data inside, allowing the program to quickly detect the file in which the data that it's looking for is stored.\n\nMy question is, at which size does it tend to be better to create a new file for the program to access? Would this even be the best way to implement what i want?\n\nThank you",

However, if you can use the token to access the account and confirm the account ID, why would you not just use the token for identification as well and leave the ID out of the URI? \n\nSo instead of making requests to:\n\n`/account/1`\n\nAnd then having to use the token to check if you are the owner of the account with ID = 1, you could just do:\n\n`/account/info`\n\nAnd use your token to provide you with the information about your account. \n\nThe token is only obtained if you make a login request with your password. So, to my understanding, the only purpose of the token is to omit password confirmation each time a new request for that specific account is made. Of course, we can go deeper and question if username/account number and password are secure enough, but as a practice API, I was wondering why you would use these IDs in the URI if it is possible to omit them entirely.

Now a days every role seems like unstable, roles are getting merged or eliminated, you cannot plan your career anymore. You cannot decide if I do X, Y, Z there is a high probability I will land P, Q or R. By the time you graduate P, Q, R roles may not even exist in the same shape anymore. You are trying to catch a moving target, it is super frustrating.\n\nNot only that you cannot build specialized expertise in a technology, it may get automated or outsourced or replaced by a newer technology.

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Let me start by saying I’m (early career) a year into this corporate job at a \"billion-dollar\" multinational company. I fully understand that any work I do while employed is legally the company's intellectual property. That said, this post is more about how I can take advantage of my contributions for my career rather than being brushed aside.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I made an earlier post about a similar situation, but at a smaller scale. Since then, things have escalated quickly, and I feel the new developments warrant a separate post.\n\nLong story short, I modernized an outdated system with great success for our region. It gained a lot of traction so much so that a team from another region requested I build the same system for them, tailored to their needs.\n\nNow here’s where the new developments start. Apparently, while all this was happening, someone higher up at the global level got access to my project and showed it to their boss who is just one level below the CEO. I still have no idea who this person is or how they even gained access to my work. Anyways, this corporate leader was so impressed that they decided the system should be rolled out globally as soon as possible. The person who shared my project then took it upon themselves to assign a team dedicated to replicating it for all regions.\n\n\nNow this assigned team somehow managed to access my project (I genuinely suspect a security breach or admin-level involvement) and tried to reverse-engineer everything I built.. but failed. They then began trying to identify who was behind the project and eventually contacted my manager (the \"official\" project manager) by pulling him into a meeting without prior notice. Odd.\n\nSo my manager then decided to setup a proper call with this team with me involved this time. In this call, they basically came forward and requested us to provide all the code, tools, and infrastructure so they can simply copy and paste it for all regions, as well as requesting several technical sessions. To make matters worse, they want me to handle all the IT bureaucratic processes for every region to get things set up. I can already see myself being roped into supporting all regions and not just my own at this point. Not only that, but I believe this \"replication\" approach will be destined to fail as each region has different user requirements and processes not quite comparable to ours. And I also strongly believe they will struggle to get anything running, due to their limited technical and business knowledge of the processes, and the type of technical questions I was being asked. \n\n\nNevertheless, if this team rolls out my solution globally for each region, they’ll receive all the visibility and credit (they'll be hosting demo sessions with region leaders which for sure I wont be invited to), while I'll be essentially cast into the shadows. What’s frustrating is that I have full knowledge of the system and am responsible for it so why isn't my manager at least being the one leading this global rollout and not some random team?\n\nI’ve been trying to indirectly nudge my manager to take ownership of the global initiative, instead of letting this new team take over. But I’m not sure how this will play out. The person who assigned this team is closer to the corporate leader, while my manager is a few steps lower in the hierarchy. So far, all he’s done is try to keep our regional manager informed of the situation playing out. Realistically, only the regional manager can mention this to the corporate leader, but I’m not confident that will happen.\n\nMy manager often says \"how will this benefit the team?\" But in this case, it’s clear he’s struggling to see any benefit in simply handing over our work to another team that will walk away with all the credit.\n\nWe’re still in the early stages, and I haven’t handed anything over yet. But I’m deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. From a career perspective, it looks like I'm gaining nothing from this besides telling myself I did the work. Being so early in my career, a project like this would really benefit me tenfold. I really don't want to waste this chance to turn this into something beneficial.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who shared their perspective. I recognize that my tone reflected more negativity than I aim to carry as a person. I allowed ego to slip in due to the project's success. Moving forward, I’ll focus on assuming positive intent and professionally advocating for myself when possible as that is the only thing I truly have control over.",

A few things struck to me as red flags -\n\n* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)\n\n* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.\n\n* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.\n\n* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.\n\nThere might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.\n\nAfter spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.\n\nI was given a warning for using my phone for \"non-productive reasons\" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours. This was followed by another warning from another member of management. Essentially two people. (With heavy irony that the person giving me the warning was also on his phone in between waiting for things to load.)\n\nFollowed by a e-mail where the entire team was CC'ed, singling me out that I did not fall into their expectations for focus and productivity with possible escalation to the CEO.\n\nConsider this a vent or a plead for affirmation, but was it just me or did this behaviour come across as total overreach?\n\n Either way, I've decided that my way of working is clearly not aligned with the company's expectations and I immediately resigned on the spot. \n\nYes, I know that the market is bad and this may have been an overreaction on my part, but would anyone of you have done the same?",

You build screens, hook up APIs, and maybe add some animations or state handling here and there. But when it comes to core business logic, anything that actually requires deeper system thinking or architectural decisions — all of that is almost always at the backend (for good reasons).\n\nAnd honestly, most app devs I’ve worked with don’t even try to go beyond that. Very little interest in performance optimization, state management patterns, or even understanding what happens behind the API. It’s mostly a UI plumbing job.\n\nSo I’m wondering — is this it? Do people just keep doing the same thing for 10–15 years until they’re replaced by younger devs who can do the same job for cheaper? Or is there a natural transition path (into BE, product, or something else) that actually makes sense?\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve been in the app dev track longer or made a pivot.\n",

        "author": "Any-Platypus-3570",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Intro.**\n\nI wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.\n\n**Story time.**\n\nAt first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.\n\nOver the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.\n\nAfter five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.\n\nI feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.\n\n**Where I applied.**\n\nAbout 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.\n\n**The numbers.**\n\nNow for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).\n\n**Advice.**\n\nOver the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a \"Skills\" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.\n\nDon't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.\n\nI spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",

Technically, I’ve been eligible to graduate for the past year, but I’ve been deliberately delaying it to continue doing internships and gain experience while at the same time applying for full-time jobs. My plan was always to hit the graduation button the moment something landed.\n\nSo far, I’ve racked up **28 months of internship experience**, mostly including software and hardware development at places like Dell Technologies and a space agency. And yet, I’m still struggling to land a full-time role, let alone an interview.\n\nThe job market here in Vancouver (and across Canada) has been... bleak. I’ll admit I’ve been picky, wanting to stay in here, but it's been *REALLY* tough. I’m feeling incredibly stuck and unsure of how to move forward.\n\nI have some options that I'm considering, but I just don't know which move is best\n\n1. Delay graduation again to do an Undergraduate Thesis in Robotics, hopefully to fluff my GPA a bit and make me more competitive for grad school. Problem is, though I have considered a master's program, I don't even know what I'd want that to be in.\n2. Graduate in August and spend day and *night* applying for jobs. Figure out a grad school to go to later and hope my CV is good enough to get in. Maybe do an accounting diploma in the evenings as a back-up (I've heard the memes, I did have a friend successfully land a job after a year of their diploma though)\n3. Go into Electrical trades (my friend spent 8 months looking for work and started doing this when he couldn't find anything).\n4. Join the Air Force\n\nFor those in similar shoes, what did you do? Would love to hear if anyone’s been in a similar situation or has insight from the other side.",

For example, data engineering and data analytics roles. Most positions I keep seeing are in some metro area requiring relocation and not even tolerating any sort of remote applicant anymore. This is completely opposite to how it was when I entered the workforce in 2020. In 2020, people were excited to talk to me and reaching out all the time regardless of where I lived. Now they don't care what my qualifications are, how talented I am, what my skill set is. They just won't even consider me at all it's like they just close the door in a huff and cut off communications if I'm not directly in the local area. \n\n\nI can give you one example. Lowe's the hardware store. Back in 2021 they were trying to recruit me even though I wasn't in the area. I talked to the same recruiter again couple weeks ago, and she was very dismissive and condescending about me not wanting to relocate to Charlotte North Carolina, and was very adamant about the fact that I would have to drive outside of Charlotte about 20 mi north of the city to Morrisville where the job was located, which is honestly kind of stupid if you ask me? Why would I go and move to a big city right? And then live out in the middle of nowhere to commute to this weird corporate office. So I would basically be making my life worse and more costly",

        "content": "**Overview**\n\nAbout 7 months ago, I got a job as a software engineer at a great company straight out of college. For the most part, I like my job. I really can't complain, but I just wanted to get other people's perspective.\n\n  \n**Context**\n\nI went to school for programming because I loved it. My passion was mainly in embedded systems. During college, I was lucky enough to get a position as a research engineer on a research program, and got to write the firmware for a very small satellite. I truly loved it. During this period, I submitted hundreds of job applications that went nowhere. I ended up getting my current job from a connection I made during college.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like my current job. I am not complaining in the slightest, I fully understand how lucky and privileged I am to be in my current position, and I don't take that for granted. I went through the job struggle like many others have. I even followed this sub, and almost lost hope because of it :(\n\n  \n**Question**\n\nIn my current position, I write Python microservices for a very large company. It can be interesting. Most importantly though, I couldn't be happier with my coworkers. They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them.\n\n  \nHowever, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. \n\n  \nThat being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore.\n\n  \n**Conclusion**\n\nAgain, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want*  to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week.\n\n  \n**TLDR**\n\nGot a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad. What do other SWE's do about this?\n\n  \n",

        "content": "Long story short, I started a new job at a FAANG company as a full stack engineer. Idk how I got it, but I got it. Before this, I was working as a Full Stack Developer for the last 4 years at a very small company. The typical task at my last job was very simple CRUD work with business logic sprinkled in and our whole system ran fine on a medium EC2 instance. Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.\n\nWhile I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.\n\nWe have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).\n\nWhat sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it? I feel like the last 4 years I've been playing little league and have only had to worry about such small things and picked up some bad habits, but now I'm in the big leagues and I feel so out of place.\n\nThanks!",

Any suggestions for projects that would stand out to employers?\n\nI’ve already started applying to jobs in hopes I find something marginally better, even while I’m rusty.

I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something.

        "content": "Long story short, I landed an amazing job as a SWE. It's at a very well known FAANG+ company and the team is sort of new and we'll be working on some interesting problems. Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.\n\nThen there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).\n\nI never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.\n\nI realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.\n\nSo, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated!\n\n  \n**Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

Also the comments just don’t stop. I’ve gone through THREE rounds of comments and actions that I’ve handled and one round was mostly a bunch of  I actions on something he misunderstood. The latest round is regarding how information is displayed, which no one else has had an issue with 6+ people, actively using the information given to debug every single issue we’ve had so far. All the info required to debug is present and there, but it could be cleaned up a little. I just don’t understand how my ticket for implementation of new features became the clean up the test steps display ticket. Am I being immature? How should I handle this?",

Should I fake it? \n* If I don't know something I say it. \nI feel like these days everybody is looking for the perfect candidate. “You don't know x or y? Next!” At least this is how it goes for dev roles. Should I pretend to know everything and wing it? (this question applies to resumes, too) \n* I am humble and quite frankly I should be because neither have I founded a million dollar company nor worked in big tech yet. \nTo me it seems like during the interview phase you have to present yourself like you are the big shit and exaggerate everything you have done. Because this is exactly what everybody else does. At least for dev roles there are programming tests that show real skills. Should I exaggerate my past successes?\n* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. \nTo me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM “knows his stuff”? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? \n* I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobs\nTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems “real”. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? \n\nI hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub.

I'm in meetings 6 hours a day, have to achieve increasingly difficult timelines, need to plan ahead for upcoming sprints and further on the roadmap, make sure capacity is being fully utilized, parallelize as much of the work as possible, help the developers grow, unblock them, provide technical leadership, accelerate them to meet deadlines, provide feedback to their managers, etc.\n\n\n\nRun on sentence is intended, but the main idea is that I'm overwhelmed with all that I'm responsible for. I have a project manager type person to support me, and recently we've had a more productive relationship in a way that they manage the backlog in Jira independently after we've scoped out the work and what can be done in parallel. They've started using ChatGPT to initially populate the details and we later review each of the stories when it's closer to the time someone needs to pickup the work. \n\nI have trouble gauging when my engineers are underperforming, or if I haven't provided enough support. I'm use to holding myself to my own standards, but I also feel like it's not fair to hold others to my own standards, because while they work for me and my personality, I feel like it's too high of a bar to force on others unless they opt in.\n\nI continually think about just leaving and being an IC somewhere else, but I also feel like 30 years from now I wont want to be an IC due to the changing landscape of the CS world.\n\nI think what I'm looking for is advice on how others manage it. It feels like as soon as I got good at the engineering part, I don't spend nearly as much time engineering.

        "content": "tl;dr: When did you know you were ready for a senior position? Or at least confident enough to start applying for them?\n\nIf you wanna know more context for why I'm asking: \n\nI have about 6 yoe all in public sector at the same agency and I really want to move on to another job (I know the market sucks right now...). I don't feel like I grew as a developer for some of those years. I still feel like a junior dev sometimes. Mid-level at best. Most of my work has been very similar bug fixes and QOL upgrades. I have been gradually gaining trust to work on larger issues over the years though, especially recently. \n\nI've suggested and implemented some design changes for certain modules, but most were small changes. Recently, while working on some bug fixes, I realized that a certain system needs a pretty dramatic re-design, which I am currently working on. We also have a relatively new dev and since we've returned to office, I've kinda been her default mentor for showing her how some of our systems work. This led me to thinking that I may be closer for a senior position than I originally thought.\n\nI know my technical skills still need a lot of improving. I've gotten complacent only working with our outdated tech stack (and general practices if I'm being honest). I haven't done much outside learning/coding over the years, but I am currently re-learning React and I'm finally working on a personal project that isn't from tutorial hell.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a recent grad from a U.S. university and a U.S. citizen. I recently got an SDE offer at Amazon. However, my offer letter and onboarding portal were all for a Vancouver, BC role, even though I’m in the U.S. and have never held a Canadian status.\n\nNaturally, I got super confused because the onboarding materials all referenced Canadian work authorization, SIN numbers, and pathways for Canadian citizens, international students, etc. I emailed Amazon’s onboarding team asking for clarification, explaining that I’m a U.S. citizen with no Canadian status and no idea how to start the work permit process.\n\nI received a reply today and was told that I should have received a U.S. offer, not a Canadian one. Furthermore, the Vancouver offer is to be canceled, and a new U.S. offer was promised by “end of day.”\n\nHowever, it is now evening, and I still haven’t received the new offer.\n\nMy original onboarding timeline mentioned a deadline of July 7th to accept the offer and complete a survey (which I completed, though with answers which apply to the Canada offer).\n\nThe Vancouver offer has definitely been revoked, attempting to access the employment documents states that I do not have an account. Tomorrow is July 4th, then the weekend, and then July 7th is Monday. I’m scared some automated system might cancel my candidacy entirely if there’s no active offer in the system by the deadline.\n\nI’m not sure if there is anything I should do in the meantime. I have already replied to the email regarding the promised U.S. offer and am hesitant to contact further, given that I have already emailed 2x today. I just don’t want to let this slip through the cracks.\n\nShould I follow up again tomorrow or wait until Monday? Will Amazon’s systems actually auto-cancel an onboarding if there’s no active offer in place?\n\nAny advice is hugely appreciated. I'm just worried about getting lost in the system due to the timeline and offer error.",

In school i’ve done a handful of cool personal projects and projects for class but nothing crazy. Now i’m in a real corporate environment and it’s all a bit overwhelming and nauseating. I ask lots of questions but still don’t feel like I’m getting many answers. The corporate lingo confuses me and I have a notebook full of acronyms that sometimes still don’t even make sense. I’m supposed to be starting actual dev work tomorrow, hopefully nothing crazy, but I’m not familiar with the languages and frameworks that I will be using. I want to learn and get a return offer but these codebases are HUGE. Larger than anything I’ve personally worked with and I don’t even really know where to start to understand how to approach a task I’m given. Any advice from anyone, current interns, previous interns, full time employees, anyone. I just really need some insight. Am I dumb? Is there some secret that they know that I don’t to understanding large codebases. I really want to succeed and create something that is good and that I am proud of.",

For the next 3 years, I grew it to a team of 40 people and was in active negotiations with Nvidia to introduce RTX into our game (it was 2019 when Nvidia just published it). I was studying just enough to keep the scholarship, but nothing more.\n\nAfter we ran out of funding, and closing it, I joined an American based startup as VP of Product & engineering, but after 6 months got promoted to CIO, where I was responsible for our product portfolio and managing our engineering and R&D departments.\n\nDuring this time, I got headhunted by one of the largest corporations in Europe and wanted me to work as Senior Project Manager (had to wear Product Manager hat too often). They made it clear, they wanted me no mater what, doubled my salary and put me in big projects to work for.  And after 2.5 years, it was one of the most amazing working experiences as had to deal with hundreds of engineers and millions of dollars in projects.\n\nAfter some internal things, I decided to go in business on my own, and start a digital agency. it was one of the roughest experiences even though within 1 year I had 3 other employees and 15 clients. And decided to close this in beginning of June.\n\n\\-- now July --\n\nI had an interview today, and one of the HR said that my CV seems like I'm lying. I just turned 29, so it is impossible for me to have done all of this. (I have recommendation letters, experience, posts and everything to prove my work...).  I asked some of my friends about this and they said the same thing too, and even suggested I lower the tittle for example from CIO to just Head of Product Management Office.\n\nI'm looking to join startups where I can bring best of my experience and knowledge, but I am seriously getting worried what my friends are suggesting.\n\nfrom 50 tailored applications I have done, I've had only 1 interview, so I'm really wondering if ATS is screwing me up, or HR see's it and thinks \"just bloated stuff\" and ignores it.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nim seriously stuck thinking for this.\n\nPS: made this post on EU version but got automatically removed.

Tbh, we hardly had meetings and just had stand up oince a day and outside of that it was mostly reaching out to people for help and once a month a product meeting with the clients. Once a quarter we had a 2 day sprint planning event that really was a waste of 2 days with most engineers just nodding along while the managers and POs did all the talking.\n\nSecond job was in FAANG - it seemed like even as a mid-level Engineer I had to spend half my day in meetings, a quarter of my day reaching out to people and the rest of the time coding. Obviously 2 hours coding isnt enough, so it caused people to have to work an extra 2-4 hours a day. Stand up was everyday for 30 minutes. No meetings friday was hardly respected. If you werent it felt like you were behind if your days didnt look like this. It was very on the go. Even in the meetings, it felt like everything was a discussion that took an extra hour of meeting time. ANythign brought up during parking lot took an hour to resolve. You put a for loop but a principal engineer wants you to do a while loop? Let's discuss it for an hour about why for loops are better or worse. If you needed to talk to anybody, you had to schedule time and theyd get annoyed if you went over the alloted scheduled time. It was stressfula nd when I left I was glad I was gone.\n\nCurrent job is at big tech but not FAANG - It seems meetings are the last thing on their mind. We have stand up twice a week. Twice a month we have an extended stand up. Even then it goes by pretty quickly (most of the time it takes half the scheduled time). Parking lot items are resolved really fast unless someone is confused about the code. Im still fairly new but i get the vibe that it's similar to my first job where you can just reach out to someone and tehy didnt mind spending an hour with you to talk it through. Once a quarter they do a \"no meetings week\" where major meetings are cancelled. This was a shocker i've never heard about, in my last job that is something laughable and seen as a waste of useful time. What's surprsiing is I make more in this job than I did in FAANG for what seems like will be less stress.\n\nJust wondering how common it is in other jobs when it comes to meetings?\n\nEdit: im 7 YOE as a backend SWE if that helps.

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.\n\nThere's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice.   \nI want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.\n\nIn 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.\n\nOr maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until  things start to click - just like it was for the first time:)  \n  \nWhat's your view/advice? Anybody who is/was in a similar situation who wants to share?\n\n",

The company has multiple projects that have received funding, but the one I applied for is very early and has not. I'm a fresh grad with no internships unfortunately and I need experience, but I also need pay, and this job seems to expect a full time commitment which I would not be able to balance with my current part time job that does pay.\n\nThe biggest thing holding me back from taking this role is that the company is \"employee owned\" and during the meeting they talked about how ownership is taken by everybody and there will most likely not be a senior ahead of me providing guidance. I feel like I already know the answer, since I have bills to pay, but just curious as to what others would do in this situation. ",

        "content": "I've got 17 YOE but self taught, primarily frontend.\n\nI haven't been doing DSA a long time but I understand the most common ones I see in interviews (and honestly in my entire career I've rarely gotten LC in an interview, and yes I do think it's important for FE).\n\nw/ LC or any algo problem on any site, the problem I've found is I spend way too much time correcting for edge cases, or smaller bugs, and then I end up butchering my original solution to fit. It never fits, n this just tells me I don't actually know the algo well enough.\n\nI've developed some newer habits while prepping for some upcoming interviews, and I find that this approach I can learn the mechanics of the problem thoroughly and surprisingly I get success only after a couple clicks.\n\nI still spend a lot of time sussing out my solution, but in the end I feel like I really understand what to do.\n\nBasically:\n\n* I read the problem and based off what I currently know I just try to work it out in my head. I don't even write anything down. I just try to visualize it, with my current set of tools. A lot of walking around the house, talking to myself.\n* After I kinda adjust everything in my head, I open up AI chat and then i tell it my approach. I don't ask for code, I just want it to tell me what it thinks of my approach\n* I go back and forth repeatedly with AI on this. Until I have a better sense of what I want to code. Rinse & repeat, I still haven't written or asked for code\n* If i can't formulate something then I go to YT and look for a short on how the problem is generally solved - Neetcode is great for this because he'll visualize it for you before diving into code. I try to make sense of it before seeing how he solves the problem, but if it clicks then i don't even bother, but he does write in python often - I'm primiarly JS/TS so its nice that i still have to do the translation in my head\n* Then I finally start writing my approach and since I've gone over it repeatedly in my head, I have better direction. Your IDE will identify most of the silly bugs so, you just need to return something - this is my own IDE, not in LC's code editor.\n* When I'm done, I don't even run it - I just have AI review it and tell me again where I\"ve messed something up. Again, no code, just more back and forth with AI. Maybe I find that there's prob a better approach, so I redo my solution.\n* When AI (claude in my case) says it looks good, then I finally run it in leetcode/whatevercode. Usually there's minimal things i need to fix. I've been getting successful submits on the first try\n\nTLDR\n\nThis is basically me, a visual learner, self taught - drilling into my head what I think will be a solid approach based off what I actually understand well. The repetition and being corrected _in discussion_ is really really good for me. A lot more time is spent thinking about the problem and talking through the different parts of the solution. The least amount of time is on the code, and there's almost no trial and error clicking. Feels great.\n\nThe funny part is I don't really have the patience to go through the entire AI response, so I kinda skim just for \"this is where the problem is\". I don't even read the whole thing because I try to connect the dots of what its suggesting, on my own.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. And yes, it's midnight on a Friday, and I'm workin on DSA. Cheers!\n",

Here's the story:\n\nI started at my company last as an entry-level software engineer in a mid-sized Midwest city. I had about one year of experience from four seperate internships. I was hired at 80k base + $5K sign-on bonus.\n\nFrom the start, I was asked to oversee an external dev team who was working on a product that previously failed twice. This quickly turned into me rewriting the entire product myself after the outsourced code turned out to be unusable. I rebuilt the app from scratch and successfully launched it by myself. The company can now sell it for a pretty penny.\n\nRecently I had my first annual review and had overwhelming good feedback. However, as a thank you for single handledly reviving their product they gave me a raise to $82K. But since the $5K sign-on bonus is gone, I’m actually making less total compensation this year than last year. They say we can revisit promotions again in about a year.\n\nI’m now sitting here wondering if I’m being taken advantage of. I feel like I’ve been operating more like a tech lead than an “entry-level” engineer. Meanwhile, friends at larger companies are making more while working as part of a full team.\n\nIs this normal? What would you do in my position? Am I being underpaid for what I bring to the table?",

Having a difficult time finding a new job -- I think part of it is that only 2.5 years puts me at an uncomfortable position where I'm not a new grad but also not exactly an experienced dev, but the other problem is that I just feel like I... can't *do* anything. \n\nAt my company I spent the majority of the time on our bug-fixing team. Idk if this is how things usually are at big companies but our codebase was largely undocumented and no one ever explained to me how anything really worked -- everything I learned I learned because I asked about it directly. Most of the bugs I fixed were either very clear-cut, where I could just look at the code and identify the problem, or for more abstract ones I did it with a lot of guidance from a senior dev. I spent a bit of time on other teams \"helping\" implement new features but I was largely in over my head and being held by the hand by my seniors while just trying to absorb whatever I could. \n\nSo I know how to code I guess. I can pick up new languages and I can look at simple things and sort of understand what they're doing and I understand principles like data structures, algorithms, encapsulation, inheritance, etc, all stuff you would find in a college course. I've also done 100+ puzzles on AdventOfCode, which I usually find to be not super difficult but have also learned about stuff I wasn't super knowledgeable about like dynamic programming and sorting algos while doing them. \n\nI feel like I'm a good employee. I'm not afraid to ask questions and I'm well-spoken and I'm proactive about my work rather than sitting in silence when I get stuck. I love to learn new stuff and always take opportunities that are presented to me. \n\nBut I don't feel like any of my knowledge transfers to an actual workplace environment. I can't build apps or  deploy microservices or optimize software or develop new features. I subscribe to /r/programming and read stuff there but I usually understand like 5% of it. I thought I would learn once I got my first job but I spent most of that time fixing bugs and trying to understand how our product even worked. I was discussing moving to a different team to start gaining more skills with my supervisor but then I was laid off. I know lots of programmers build stuff in their free time but I have no idea what to even make. I don't even know if I *can* make anything. So what do I do? How do I learn? Hope I get a better job? Do a boot camp? Grad school?\n\nWould be very greatful to hear how any of you transitioned from being a booksmart college level programmer to an actual developer",

I've tested everything i can, and documented it all but i'm never 100% confident that it won't break everything and start a massive fire. Fortunately, we have rollback processes that's quick, and i utilize feature flagging as much as i can but you never know what edge case you missed. When i go to deploy, i'm always sweating and my heart is pounding as i read the logs and watch the dashboards.. We have automation, and end to end tests that cover most of our bases, but i'm always afraid i'll be the cause of a fire due to a lack of due diligence. ",

I am stuck working on maintenance of legacy software with developers who are not interested in learning new technology and are good with being where they are. That is completely understandable for me, but I know I can provide more and I know I can do more. Tried getting transfered into a team which actually does Software Development but I cannot get transfered because they allocated me on maintenance projects until further notice. I work for a minimal wage, asked for a raise but am getting ghosted, and was declined for a job after passing 4 rounds of interview. Basically I want to hear your opinion and any tips for where I should go with my career. I feel really stuck... ",

Since April, I've been applying for jobs that i like, close to 80 so far. I've noticed that many job listings on LinkedIn are weeks old and still show up in my job search alerts.\n\nThis experience makes me wonder if ghost jobs are indeed real.

Surprisingly, it takes maybe 1 month for some to reach out. \n\nI have seen some of my co-workers finding new gigs and posting them on LinkedIn.

I don’t have all the details yet, but my expectation is that i will work more hours, which is fine. Right now, I just want to work on stuff and grow professionally. \n\nI’m aware of the risks: lower job security, and a lot of uncertainty. But staying where I am feels like a slow death career-wise. \n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience? Did it open new doors, or was it just stress in a different flavor?\n\nCheers\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I (24m), just graduated from college, and I’m blessed to have received an offer for SWE at a FAANG company. I was an intern twice and was asked to come back full time. Last week I found out that I will be working on a distributed systems team that codes almost entirely in C++. The product is internal and was the basis of an industry revered paper from the company in the early 2010’s, think Chubby or Kubernetes. I met with the manager a few days ago, and he seems really nice, but cautioned me that the work is quite challenging. \n\nOf course I am super grateful to be in such a position given the condition of the market, and I look forward to learning as much as I can. However, I can’t help but feel anxious about starting my new job. I have zero experience in distributed systems and did not even take the class since it was only offered at my school during my first year there. I did take a networking class, which touched a bit on some of the fundamentals of distributed systems (CAP theorem, concurrency), but really nothing practical and useful. My experience with C++ is quite limited as well, as I have mostly coded in Java and Python. \n\nWith that said, how can I succeed at my new job? What advice would you give to a new grad trying to learn as much as they can while delivering in what is likely a team full of experts? How do you fight the inevitable imposter syndrome? Any resources I can leverage? I recently picked up Designing Data-Intensive Applications and have been polishing up my C++, but I start in a couple of weeks so there is not much time. \n\nYour advice would be much appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",

        "author": "Accomplished-Copy332",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'll put another take out there that is even more controversial. Backend tasks are more likely to be fully automated by AI than frontend tasks. \n\nI've been doing [research](https://www.designarena.ai/) (disclaimer: all content and data on the [linked site](https://www.designarena.ai/) is completely FREE and open-source. It's not to self-promote but to just share research I've been doing and data that I've collected) where I've gotten close to 7K people around the world to vote on different implementations of apps and interfaces from different models. \n\nMy main takeaway from just looking looking at the different generations people have been creating is that AI is good at producing simple interfaces that have already been done before, but it doesn't really create anything that's sophisticated or what I would call professional and production-grade. \n\nBack to my earlier point. Backend tasks seem easier to automate to me since in those cases, the right \"answer\" is usually a lot more clear and concrete. On the other hand with frontend tasks and UI/UX, some things of course are subjective and change with human preferences/trends. Even outside the research and just coding I do on my own, I find the models are pretty good (though they of course make mistakes) at one-shot generating scripts, but need a lot of guidance to get UI/UX things correct. \n\nWhat are people's thoughts on this?
