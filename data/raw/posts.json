        "content": "This just happened and I don't know how to process it.\n\nContext:\n\nI am not a data engineer, I work in dashboards, but our engineer just left us and I was the last person in the data team under a CTO. I do know SQL and Python but I was open about my lack of ability in using our database modeling too and other DE tools. I had a few KT sessions with the engineer which went well, and everything seemed straightforward.\n\nCut to today:\n\nI noticed that our database modeling tool had things listed as materializing as views, when they were actually tables in BigQuery. Since they all had 'staging' labels, I thought I'd just correct that. I created a backup, asked ChatGPT if I was correct (which may have been an anti-safety step looking back, but I'm not a DE needed confirmation from somewhere), and since it was after office hours, I simply dropped all those tables. Not 30 seconds later and I receive calls from upper management, every dashboard just shutdown. The underlying data was all there, but all connections flatlined. I check, everything really is down. I still don't know why. In a moment of panic I restore my backup, and then rerun everything from our modeling tool, then reran our cloud scheduler. In about 20 minutes, everything was back. I suspect that this move was likely quite expensive, but I just needed everything to be back to normal ASAP.\n\nI don't know what to think from here.  How do I check that everything is running okay?  I don't know if they'll give me an earful tomorrow or if I should explain what happened or just try to cover up and call it a technical hiccup. I'm honestly quite overwhelmed by my own incompetence\n\nEDIT more backstory\n\nI am a bit more competent in BigQuery (before today, I'd call myself competent) and actually created a BigQuery ETL pipeline, which the last guy replicated into our actual modeling tool as his last task. But it wasn't quite right, so I not only had to disable the pipeline I made, but I also had to re-engineer what he tried doing as a replication. Despite my changes in the model, nothing seemed to take effect in the BigQuery. After digging into it, I realized the issue: the modeling tool treated certain transformations as views, but in BigQuery, they were actually tables. Since views can't overwrite tables, any changes I made silently failed.\n\nTo prevent this kind of conflict from happening again, I decided to run a test to identify any mismatches between how objects are defined in BigQuery vs. in the modeling tool, fix those now rather than dealing with them later. Then the above happened",

I'd estimate the vendor spends maybe 1-6 hours per year doing support. \n\nThey don't know what value the company derives from it so they ask me every year about it. It does generate more value than it costs.\n\nI'm just wondering if this is even reasonable? We have over a hundred various systems that we need to incorporate as topics into the \"warehouse\" this IT team purchased from another vendor (it's highly immutable so really any ETL is just filling other databases in the same server). They did this stuff in like 2021-2022 and have yet to extend further, including building pipelines for the other sources. At this rate, we'll be paying millions of dollars to manage the full suite (plus whatever custom build charges hit upfront) of ETL, no even compute or storage. The $10k isn't for cloud, it's all on prem on our computer and storage.\n\nThere's probably implementation details I'm leaving out. Just wondering if this is reasonable. \n",

My colleagues implemented a pattern where:\n\n* Each service writes individual records directly to Iceberg tables via Iceberg python client (pyiceberg)\n* Or a solution where we leverage S3 for decoupling, where:\n   * Every single S3 event triggers a Lambda that appends **one record** to Iceberg\n   * They envision eventually using Iceberg for everything - both operational and analytical workloads\n\n**Their Vision:**\n\n* \"Why maintain multiple data stores? Just use Iceberg for everything\"\n* \"Services can write directly without complex pipelines\"\n* \"AWS S3 Tables handle file optimization automatically\"\n* \"Each team manages their own schemas and tables\"\n\n**What We're Seeing in Production:**\n\nWe're currently handling hundreds of events per minute across all services. We put the S3 -> Lambda -> append individual record via pyiceberg to the iceberg table solution. What I see is lot of those concurrency errors:\n\n    CommitFailedException: Requirement failed: branch main has changed: \n    expected id xxxxyx != xxxxxkk\n\nMultiple Lambdas are trying to commit to the same table simultaneously and failing.\n\n**My Position**\n\nI originally proposed:\n\n* Using PostgreSQL for operational/transactional data\n* Periodically ingesting PostgreSQL data into Iceberg for analytics\n* Micro-Batching records for streaming data\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* Iceberg uses optimistic concurrency control - only one writer can commit at a time per table\n* We're creating hundreds of tiny files instead of fewer, optimally-sized files\n* Iceberg is designed for \"large, slow-changing collections of files\" (per their docs)\n* The metadata overhead of tracking millions of small files will become expensive (regardless of the fact that this is abstracted away from use by using managed S3 Tables)\n\n**The Core Disagreement:** My colleagues believe S3 Tables' automatic optimizations mean we don't need to worry about file sizes or commit patterns. They see my proposed architecture (Postgres + batch/micro-batch ingestion, i.e. using Firehose/Spark structured streaming) as unnecessary complexity.\n\nIt feels we're trying to use Iceberg as both an OLTP and OLAP system when it's designed for OLAP.\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. Has anyone successfully used Iceberg as their primary datastore for both operational AND analytical workloads?\n2. Is writing individual records to Iceberg (hundreds per minute) sustainable at scale?\n3. Do S3 Tables' optimizations actually solve the small files and concurrency issues?\n4. Am I overcomplicating by suggesting separate operational/analytical stores?\n\nLooking for real-world experiences, not theoretical debates. What actually works in production?\n\nThanks!",

The idea is to create a permissionless compute layer where anyone can contribute idle GPUs or CPUs. Developers can run containerized workloads (training, inference, validation), and everything is cryptographically verified. It‚Äôs essentially DePIN combined with AI workloads.\n\nNot saying it solves everything overnight, but it flips the model: instead of a few hyperscalers owning all the compute, we can build a network where anyone contributes and anyone can access. Trust is built in by design, not by paperwork.\n\nHas anyone here tried running AI jobs on decentralized infrastructure or looked into Ocean Nodes?

It‚Äôs frustrating.\n\nSo instead of jumping back into another corporate gig, I‚Äôm thinking of pivoting to full-stack data analytics for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). My plan is to help them make sense of their data‚ÄîETL, analytics, dashboards, the whole package(using cloud tools ofc).\n\nHere is my pricing plan :\n\n**for 2 to 3 datasources :\n\n     $4000/month during pipeline building\n\n     $2000/month for when pipeline is done and customers would only want new dashboards occasionally, fix bugs or change some logic\n\n**for 3 to 5 datasources :\n\n     $8000 during pipeline building building\n\n     $4000 maintenance mode\n\n**for complex once with more than 5 datasource\n\n    $8000 - $15000\n\nWhat do you think of this pricing model? Is this reasonablr enough??\n\nFor those who‚Äôve done something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow did you find clients?\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhat pricing or engagement models worked for you?\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny pitfalls to watch out for?\n\nAppreciate any insights or advice you can share!\n",

        "content": "This is not just another post about 'how to transition into Data Engineering'. I want to share a real challenge I‚Äôve been facing, despite being actively learning, practicing, and building projects. Yet, breaking into a DE role has proven harder than I expected.\n\nI have around 6 years of experience working as a data analyst, mostly focused on advanced SQL, data modeling, and reporting with Tableau. I even led a short-term ETL project using Tableau Prep, and over the past couple of years, my work has been very close to what an Analytics Engineer does‚Äîbuilding robust queries over a data warehouse, transforming data for self-service reporting, and creating scalable models.\n\nAlong this journey, I‚Äôve been deeply investing in myself. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Engineering course that‚Äôs constantly updated with modern tools, techniques, and cloud workflows. I‚Äôve also built several open-source projects where I apply DE concepts in practice: Python-based pipelines, Docker orchestration, data transformations, and automated workflows.\n\nI tend to avoid saying 'I have no experience' because, while I don‚Äôt have formal production experience in cloud environments, I do have hands-on experience through personal projects, structured learning, and working with comparable on-prem or SQL-based tools in my previous roles. However, the hiring process doesn‚Äôt seem to value that in the same way.\n\nThe real obstacle comes down to the production cloud experience. Almost every DE job requires AWS, Databricks, Spark, etc.‚Äîbut not just knowledge, production-level experience. Setting up cloud projects on my own helps me learn, but comes with its own headaches: managing resources carefully to avoid unexpected costs, configuring environments properly, and the limitations of working without a real production load.\n\nI‚Äôve tried the 'get in as a Data Analyst and pivot internally' strategy a few times, but it hasn‚Äôt worked for me.\n\nAt this point, it feels like a frustrating loop: companies want production experience, but getting that experience without the job is almost impossible. Despite the learning, the practice, and the commitment, the outcome hasn't been what I hoped for.\n\nSo my question is‚Äîhow do people actually break this loop? Is there something I‚Äôm not seeing? Or is it simply about being patient until the right opportunity shows up? I‚Äôm genuinely curious to hear from those who‚Äôve been through this or from people on the hiring side of things.",

Code-first approach to API workflows.\n\nHey r/dataengineering,\n\nWe built Sequor to solve a recurring problem: choosing between two bad options for API/app integration:\n\n1. Proprietary black-box SaaS connectors with vendor lock-in\n2. Custom scripts that are brittle, opaque, and hard to maintain\n\nAs data engineers, we wanted a solution that followed the principles that made dbt so powerful (code-first, git-based version control, SQL-centric), but designed specifically for API integration workflows.\n\n**What Sequor does:**\n\n* Connects APIs to your databases with an iterator model\n* Uses SQL for all data transformations and preparation\n* Defines workflows in YAML with proper version control\n* Adds procedural flow control (if-then-else, for-each loops)\n* Uses Python and Jinja for dynamic parameters and response mapping\n\n**Quick example:** \n\n* Data acquisition: Pull Salesforce leads ‚Üí transform with SQL ‚Üí push to HubSpot ‚Üí all in one declarative pipeline.\n* Data activation (Reverse ETL): Pull customer behavior from warehouse ‚Üí segment with SQL ‚Üí sync personalized offers to Klaviyo/Mailchimp\n* App integration: Pull new orders from Amazon ‚Üí join with SQL to identify new customers ‚Üí create the customers and sales orders in NetSuite\n* App integration: Pull inventory levels from NetSuite ‚Üí filter with SQL for eBay-active SKUs ‚Üí update quantities on eBay\n\n**How it's different from other tools:**\n\nInstead of choosing between rigid and incomplete prebuilt integration systems, you can easily build your own custom connectors in minutes using just two basic operations (**transform** for SQL and **http\\_request** for APIs) and starting from prebuilt examples we provide.\n\nThe project is open source and we welcome any feedback and contributions.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Website: [https://sequor.dev/](https://sequor.dev/) (includes code examples)\n* Quickstart: [https://docs.sequor.dev/getting-started/quickstart](https://docs.sequor.dev/getting-started/quickstart)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor](https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor)\n* Examples of prebuilt integrations: [https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor-integrations](https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor-integrations)\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* What's your current approach to API integrations?\n* What business apps and integration scenarios do you struggle with most?\n* Are there specific workflows that have been particularly challenging to implement?",

I would think that it would be very simple just to run an overnight job of truncating table A in snowflake -> load data from table A salesforce and then we would have an accurate copy in snowflake (obviously minus any changes made in salesforce after the overnight job).\n\n  \nIve recently discovered that the team managing this process takes only \"changes\" in salesforce (I think this is called change data capture..?), using the salesforce record's last modified date to determine whether we need to load/update data in salesforce. I have discovered some pretty glaring data quality issues in snowflakes copy.. and it makes me ask the question... why cant we just run a job like i've described in the paragraph above? Is it to mitigate the amount of data movement? We really don't have that much data even.",

These rules are not available in a source system today, so the requirement is to create an editable dataset within the lakehouse. This isn't data that's bronze or will be transformed. Business also needs an UI to set these rules. \n\nWhile iceberg does have data editing capabilities, I'm somewhat convinced it's better to have another custom application take care of the rules definition and storage, and be a source of the rules data, instead of managing it all with iceberg and a query engine.  To me, it sounds like management of rules is an OLTP use case. \n\nTill we decide on this, we are letting the rules be in a file, and that file acts as a source of data brought into the lakehouse. \n\nDoes anyone else do this? Maintain some master data set that's only in the data lakehouse?  Should lakehouses only have a copy of data sourced from somewhere, or can they be a store of completely new datasets created directly in the lake? ",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to ask if you have any rules for when you'd use SQL first and when you build tooling and fuller suites in PySpark.\n\nMy company intend to copy some data from a very small (relatively) Oracle database to AWS. This won't be the entire DB copied, it will be just some of the data we want to use for analytical purposes (non-live, non-streaming, just weekly or monthly reporting). Therefore, it does not have to be migrated using RDS or into Redshift. The architects planned to dump some of the data into S3 buckets and then our DE team will take it from there. \n\nWe have some SQL code written by a previous DE to query the on-prem DB and create views and new tables. My question is: I would prefer no-SQL if I could choose. My instinct would be to write the new code within AWS in PySpark and make it more structured, implement unit testing etc., and move away from SQL. Some team members, however, say the easiest thing is to use the SQL code we have to create the views which the analytics team are used to faster within AWS and why reinvent the wheel. But I feel like this new service is a good opportunity to improve the codebase and move away from SQL which I see as limiting.\n\nWhat would be your approach to this situation? Do you have a general rule for when SQL would be preferable and when you'd use PySpark?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice and input!",

I've been doing this for about 8 years but only recently learned about DBT and SQLMesh, for example._\n\nI'm working on an ELT pipeline that converts input files of various formats into Parquet files on Google Cloud Storage, which subsequently need to be loaded into BigQuery tables (append-only).\n\n- The Extract processes drop files into GCS at unspecified times.\n\n- The Transform processes convert _newly created_ files to Parquet and drops the result back into GCS.\n\n- The Load process needs to load the _newly created_ files into BigQuery, making sure to load every file exactly once.\n\nTo process only new (or failed) files, I guess there are two main approaches:\n\n1. Query the output, see what's missing, then process that. Seems simple, but has scalability limitations because you need to list the entire history. Would need to query both GCS and BQ to compare what files are still missing.\n\n2. Have some external system or work queue that keeps track of incomplete work. Scales better, but has the potential to go out of sync with reality (e.g. if Extract fails to write to the work queue, the file is never transformed or loaded).\n\nI suppose this is a common problem that everyone has solved already.

For me, Leetcode is definitely not reflective at all of what you would do in the majority of programming jobs and is very algorithmically heavy. Most of these algorithms you will not need to know at all most of the time as most languages contain core libraries that do this stuff way more efficiently than most developers will be able to do. \n\nCase in point, I was stuck on the first question today for about 45 minutes mainly because the question was worded really badly. I managed to solve that pretty quickly after I understood what it was asking for although I will admit I did it in my IDE rather than in Leetcode as nobody codes in the equivalent of Notepad anymore (although that's how I started back in the day). \n\nThe second question I was completely stumped and gave up because it was more maths than programming (and believe it or not, you do not need to be good at maths to be a good developer). It's really going to depend on what you end up doing as an actual job. \n\nIf you are writing drivers or doing anything mathematically heavy in your job then yes Leetcode might be a good fit but mostly it's algorithmic nonsense that most developers will never even use. I've worked for some of the biggest banks, insurance providers doing APIs hooking up to some pretty complex business logic and never have I had to use anything close to Leetcode level solutions. \n\nMy point is, don't be disappointed in yourself if you struggle with Leetcode. You can still be a success. Lead teams. Produce mobile applications and desktop systems that millions of users use and enjoy each year all without ever needing to worry about the types or problems shown on Leetcode. ",

Im motivated to get into the industry now, but wondering how to get up to date fast, and how to differentiate myself from the new graduates popping up now with my rather empty resume. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to move forward, any courses that ramp up extremely quickly for someone who kind or more-so needs a reminder.

I definitely need to do it on my own and at my own pace. I will always program in an independent manner.",

I still struggle with the node configs but I know how to write js, I've also made apps in kotlin with compose. I've written in python, i've made with flutter and dart.

This might be because the issues were new to me, I quickly got the grasp of where are going wrong, but finding the workable fix take me sometime, or maybe because I'm just not good enough at logic or programming, which makes me slower than others.\n\nWhat can I do now?\n\nI'm starting to question myself about pursuing a career in programming.

        "content": "Hey guys, I'm feeling really frustrated. I've been self-studying HTML, CSS and PHP, but I keep hitting these mental blocks that make me feel like I'm not making progress or that I'm too dumb to ever get this.\n\nMy question is: Does anyone have experience with or know platforms where I can hire an online tutor? Like, private PHP lessons? Would it be worth it?\n\nIf anyone's been through this or has tips to overcome these blocks, I'd really appreciate the help!\n\nSo here's my story...  \nI started by training my programming logic and spent about 3 months watching video lessons and studying basics: operators, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, arrays. Up to that point, it was okay - I could do exercises (some were hard, but I could work through them).\n\nThe problems started when I got to callbacks, Promises, async/await and try/catch. These concepts just wouldn't click no matter how many explanations I watched.\n\nI got so tired of just doing exercises and watching videos that I switched to PHP (because I wanted to build something real to stay motivated). The basics (operators, loops, functions) were fine since they're similar to JS. (Not sure if this was the right choice, but I thought about creating a login system and saw PHP would work well - just needed to download Laragon and start, and I'm actually liking PHP.)\n\nBut when it came time to actually code and start the project, I froze. I'd search online, I could understand what the code was doing - like I understood how the database connection worked conceptually - but when I went to type it out, I just couldn't remember the whole code. I felt like I was just copying and pasting, even if the code worked in the end, and everyone says this hurts real learning.\n\nTo make it worse, a coworker (who also studies) told me that in 3 months he was already way beyond this and that I should try harder. This gave me a massive mental block - it feels like no matter how much I study, I'm not getting anywhere.",

My current no-brainer answer is diving into web dev but I wonder what IT roadmap is the most suitable for me do you think?  \n  \nAnd recently, I enrolled for an offline IT bootcamp which cost literally no penny. But it has its caveats: 2 years contract *(+9 months of waiting period if need be + 3 months training = 3y max)* after completing training which basically forces me to work at any company affiliated with this bootcamp, with a MAXIMUM salary around 2-4 mils IDR *($122-$245)* depending on job placement which in my opinion is a little too greedy. I haven't signed the contract. Should I go for it or should I pave my own way forward? but how and what should I do? Any advice will be appreciated!",

Now that I have moved to a small startup,this is the first time I am building something where DB design wasn't done by me so I am not even sure if this is the correct way but all these years of Machine Learning I have never seen a DB design like this.\nThere is around 500 tables on the DB with no naming conventions, barely any primary key or foreign key. So I decided to do a compare to find common column names so it makes my work easier to extract the data, but turns out even the names of the columns that are joint is different it could be subscription_id in one column and original_subscription_id somewhere else. So many inconsistency that I am not able to find proper relationship. \nTo further this issue many tables are many to many relationship. \nMy question based on everything is\n1. Is there true in other organization? \n2. Is there a way to fix this without refactoring the entire DB?\n3. As ML guy I rely on DB so pulling them and finding relationship is important. I thought of brute forcing the relationship by finding such similarities but the DB is vast.So I am not even sure how to approach it. \n4. The last option is to build the entire DE pipeline and fix this but given that I am the only there and building it will take time,I am planning to do it on the side\n\nThank you everyone for your assistance.\n\nP.S.:I tried asking this question on Software Engineering but it got removed.",

Don't want to go to Spring. I especially don't want the OOP infested garbage, with Clean Code (TM) principles everywhere, forcing me to control+click through one tiny function that calls three functions, each of them calling three functions, making me completely forget what it was I was following/debugging by the fourth class/file I have to open and read through.\n\nAt the same time I am familiar with crazyness of Javascript (which Typescript would alleviate somewhat), I don't want Microsoft products (C#, .NET). I am considering Golang at the moment, and I would really not be against Rust or something purely FP even (I have played around with Elm a bit and damn does that thing seem immune to errors)\n\nBut, once again, realities of job market. I am not a senior dev, mid at best, and I'd rather have higher odds of finding a job within a few months, rather than low odds in a year+ after grueling amount of learning.\n\nShould I just grit my teeth, brush up on my Java/Spring starting from fundamentals (which are lacking in my case), or don't listen to naysayer-thoughts and keep up with Rust and maybe Golang on the side as it's easy enough to be complementary, or something else entirely?",

Nevertheless it sounds like no much fun for a great deal of people I love C++ and it's main language to learn for me in long run (about 2.5 years in process now). I'm trying to get into high performance and data-intensive application development, but for the summer I have some free time to learn something apart curricula and C++ related stuff I learn myself. The plan is to improve math skills like discrete math and calculus, finish CLRS, and get some of parallel programming techniques. But also I'd like to learn another programming language. Apart from C++ I have some knowledge of C#, Python and Ruby. Next year I have a DSA course in Java. So main candidates are C# or Java as they somewhere in between of C++ and Python. But I also consider Rust. Does it sufficient to know some Rust along with C++ or it's better to gain some expertise in a quite different language? ",

I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech \"influencers\" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.\n\nThe last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.\n\nSome of the crazy things I've heard\n\n* \"I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations\" (director to his managers)\n* \"If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does\" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). \n   * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now\n* \"If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job\" (engineers to other engineers)\n   * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.\n* \"Working nights and weekends is expected\" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends).\n   * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently.\n\n  \nFinal thoughts\n\n* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be \"passionate\" about making a bunch of money, or \"passionate\" about the product to survive.\n* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.\n* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",

I‚Äôve tried my best to work on our relationship, but he‚Äôs spent all year treating me with explicit disdain, not making eye contact, and ignoring whatever I say in team lunches.\n\nI buckled down as much as I could to do better, but every 1:1 became a condescending berating session and I never felt like I truly belonged on the team.\n\nWhenever features were delayed, the majority of the time it was because of consistently broken infra, incomplete features from sister teams that mine depended on to start, or inaccurate guidance from dev‚Äôs I was asked to consult. I accepted the weaknesses within my control and improved them, but no matter what I did, I could never beat the narrative.\n\nAnything I did good was sarcastically devalued and whenever anything went wrong, my manager would tell me I should‚Äôve taken X action that I wouldn‚Äôt have known to do at the time without privileged knowledge or time travel (hindsight advice).\n\nCoworkers and mentor repeatedly told me I was doing fine, but I just had our first performance review, and I‚Äôm being offered 2 things:\n\n**PIP vs Severance.**\n\nThis severance side offer is brand new this year and our company has had huge layoffs.\n\nThe actual meeting was another vague collection of criticisms, in which, when I asked him what I could‚Äôve ideally done differently, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to give specific edge cases for you to iterate literally off of and am just looking for high level resourcefulness from you‚Äù.\n\nWhen he would list specifically delayed features, I would tell him how I did everything in my power, including implementing his advice (which I can prove), only for the infra related reasons to delay it.\n\nWhen I tried to show areas I‚Äôve improved in, he would agree but then re-insist how below the mark I am even though I‚Äôm never been sure what a ‚ÄúMeets Expectation‚Äù counterpart of me hypothetically looks like all year. His goalpost for me always felt fictional.\n\nNow, I feel extremely jaded and demotivated being forced into this job market.

In other words, I thought I‚Äôll never see another PHP role again, so I stopped searching for them, stopped calling myself a PHP specialist, stopped reading up on latest versions, and got rusty, then a company that uses PHP found me, and they were offering me an insanely good deal, so I jumped at the role. \n\nThe online assessment was easy, it was medium leet code that required PHP, and I‚Äôm great at PHP, so it took me 10 minutes. The screening interview was even easier, we were supposed to talk for 30 minutes, we spoke for 90 minutes, the guy told me what to expect in the technical interview (because I asked), he mentioned all the standards buzzwords like system design and application design, then went into the details, got more particular, told me to brush up on my redis and Java, MVC frameworks, MySQL and security protocols, so I did that - huge mistake. \n\nThe technical interview was far more like a ‚Äúscreener‚Äù than anything else, we didn‚Äôt cover system design as intricately as I thought, a lot of what transpired was a pop quiz with questions like ‚Äúdo you know what traits are?‚Äù  and ‚Äúdo you know what anonymous functions are and how they‚Äôre used?‚Äù \n\nThis was supposed to take 45 minutes, I had him on the video chat for 2 hours,  I acted clueless the whole time, not because I didn‚Äôt know what half the answers were, but because I didn‚Äôt study for a pop quiz, i was shocked, I was nervous, I was stressed, I was angry, and most importantly, I was disappointed in myself, because this was the luckiest break ever, and I ruined it. \n\nAt one point I was so lost, I was second guessing myself, so he did me a favor and shared a codepen, I passed the little ‚Äúcoding challenge‚Äù he looked relieved, said ‚Äúokay so you know this‚Äù then resumed the pop quiz, which again, I bombed. \n\nGuess what I did to prepare for this interview? Yep, you guessed it! Leet Code and online lectures. Why did i go this route? Tech forums convinced me the job market is an AI-driven rat race and the hiring manager confirmed the bias for me, but I would‚Äôve passed the technical if I just opened and read PHP documentation like the good old days. \n\nSo the moral of the story is, do all your general interview prep periodically, and when you get the actual interview, just read the documentation, because you never know what kind of interviewer you‚Äôre gonna get. Do not be me. ",

Dun dun dunnnnn.  \n  \nThose that have been working for a few years now, what are your future plans for your career as we face the incoming AI onslaught?   \n  \nIt's wild witnessing such a paradigm shift that will literally affect almost every aspect of our lives. We got a bit of a sneak preview, working in tech. Now AI tools are becoming more mainstream and everyone that's trying to make a buck is rushing to either incorporate AI into their product, or make a new AI product. At some point the barrier to entry for coding will be completely mitigated by AI. As long as you can articulate the concepts in natural speech, your idea can be created. We're not there yet, but quickly trending toward it.   \n  \nI personally try to take all the AI hype with a grain of salt, especially with claims like \"AI wrote 30% of Google's new code\" and such that talk up the very same products they're trying to sell. But it can still do plenty of coding, I'm sure most of us know well by now. At this point you have to embrace or get left behind, it seems. Maybe some don't agree with this notion?  \n  \nI'm at 6 YOE and would like to continue in this industry as long as I can. I'm just not sure where on the spectrum of 'get good at React' and 'get good at spoon feeding chatgpt your  project requirements\" we're at. Developer roles will look different in 5 years. \n\nSo, just curious how others are approaching things. Do you feel comfortable in your current role? Continuing to learn new languages/frameworks/whatever as needed for the job? Or focusing on building an army of AI agents? Have you embraced AI into your workflow, or been resistant?

        "author": "Organic-Pipe-8139",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just did another mock interview with another Staff Engineer from Open AI I‚Äôd argue this is the near perfect solution for Design K Leaderboard for Facebook comments or videos. To be honest the design was so impressive, I was struggling to keep up.\n\nHere is the full video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&)\n\nSo this is exactly how a person of this caliber nailed the interview step by step:\n\nWhat I really liked is how he handled the ambiguity of the problem. He kept asking clarifying questions, gradually narrowing down what exactly the system needed to do. He started by defining the scope, deciding to track trending content globally and focusing mainly on real user reactions (ignoring edge cases like bot farms). He emphasized the need for real-time or near real-time updates, especially important when people refresh their pages a lot.\n\nHe moved on to data modeling and decided to track each event (like user reactions) with details like user ID, post ID, reaction type, and timestamp (this one was critical as he spent an incredible amount of time later on discussing how bad clocks really are in a distributed system). Importantly, each user only has one reaction per post at any time, which simplifies some of the complexity.\n\nThen he dove into the scaling challenges. He chose a regional approach for data handling, using local timestamps for consistency within each region, and came up with this clever \"hot/cold\" key strategy. Basically, popular (\"hot\") posts update almost instantly, while less popular (\"cold\") posts don't need frequent updates. Regions share their top posts periodically to keep the global leaderboard updated.\n\nInterviewee didn't tie himself down to a specific database or any tools in general. Unlike mid level engineers, he actually used zero tools at all and just kept the interview on the conceptual level. He even mentioned a custom solution might be better than something traditional, highlighting using write-ahead logs and processing events separately from aggregating them. I bet this might be because he spent most of his career at Google (Youtube & Spanner) as well as Meta and OpenAI where tools are mostly proprietary and made in house.\n\nHe implicitly acknowledged the CAP theorem, but explained that real systems don‚Äôt work like research papers referring to CRDB aka CockroachDB, which claims to be both available & consistent. Even when it ‚Äúfeels like‚Äù consistency is important, you almost always want to prioritize availability and default eventual consistency rather than absolute consistency. This practical decision means the system stays reliable even if it's not theoretically perfect.\n\nHe showed how practical trade-offs matter more than absolute precision. Losing or misordering a small percentage of events is okay if it means the system stays fast and scalable.\n\nInterviewee leveraged the idea of data distribution, noting most posts have low engagement, while a few blow up. This influenced his \"hot/cold\" strategy, optimizing resources.\n\nOne subtle yet powerful idea he stressed was \"monotonicity.\" By ensuring updates always move in one direction (like engagement always increasing), the system becomes much simpler to reconcile and scale.\n\nFinally, his incremental approach to design really stood out. He started broad, refined step by step, and wasn't afraid to revisit decisions. Overall, it's one of the best example of how real-world system design works and how a true staff engineer really behaves like. Managing complexity and making smart trade-offs rather than trying to build a theoretically perfect system. I definitely learned a ton from this one as an interviewer, but curious to hear what you all might think.¬†\n\nTL;DR\n\n\\- Ask questions, don't make assumptions, don't use tools mindlessly, and use the experience you got on the job to impress the interviewer on the design.\n\n",

Think San Antonio / Orlando / Phoenix type of MCOL city.\n\nThe job‚Äôs honestly pretty great, super chill WLB (almost never over 40 hours), everyone‚Äôs really friendly, and the tech stack is solid (React, Spring Boot, Django) since the project only started in 2020. It‚Äôs laid-back enough that I‚Äôve had the freedom to work on finishing my OMSCS degree from Georgia Tech.\n\nNow I just got an offer for a new job in Seattle, around $140k, hybrid (2 days in-office) for now but I‚Äôve heard they might go full RTO soon. I used one of those simple cost of living calculators online and it says my current $80k here is equivalent to about $110k in Seattle... So I'm wondering‚Ä¶ is being fully remote  worth the $30k difference?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. And just for context‚ÄîI‚Äôm 32M, married (no kids), and had a totally different career for most of my 20s before I got my 2nd degree in CS and switched to tech. My wife (30F) makes around $80k and works in a field where she can find a new job within a week in pretty much any major city, so we‚Äôre not worried about her on that front.",

I would ask for another minute to think of how you'd approach the question. The problem with saying the very first thing that comes to mind is that if it's obviously wrong then the interviewer may correct you which would be interpreted as giving you a hint which would count against you. After you've wrestled with the idea for a bit only then share your solution out loud with the interviewer.\n\nI wouldn't even bother mentioning an obvious brute force solution if you already have a better idea in mind since talking about the brute force will cut into your time.\n\nSo the TLDR here is to be more strategic about when to vocalize your thought process.\n\n2.) during non-coding rounds, wait for your turn to talk, never interrupt the interviewer\n\nThis will probably be obvious to most but I used to interrupt the interviewer near the beginning. Not intentionally. If they said something that I thought would make for a really interesting question, then I would ask it right there when there was a natural pause in the conversation.\n\nI now realize this is very bad. It's always better to wait till you're sure that they are done speaking or until they ask you if you have any questions. You gain nothing by interrupting them but can easily make a bad impression and decrease the signal you give from your question by asking during a time in which they aren't fully ready to evaluate you since they still need to get through the rest of what they wanted to say. Plus, they might have brought up an even better point later on.\n\n3.) during a hiring manager round, to express that you're serious about the role, interview the interviewer\n\nYou can't tell the interviewer that you really want the position. That you've deeply thought about staying at the company in the long term. That you are a top candidate.\n\nYou can only express these things by asking tough questions that make the interviewer think and possibly feel like they're being interviewed. Obviously you don't want to take this too far. You should ask questions that show you've deeply thought about the company's business model and how the role you're being hired for aligns with that. You should ask questions to see how clearly the hiring manager understands what will be needed for the role. It is genuinely a red flag if you're being hired for a role in which the hiring manager is not sure about what you'll be working on. Think about what other things could be red flags as well and ask some pointed (but still polite) questions about those.\n\nMy current strategy for this is to split my preparation for this part of the interview over 2 days. On day 1 I learn as much as I can from quick online research about the company and do my best to come up with questions of substance. On day 2 I try again and this is when I come up with much higher quality questions.",

        "content": "I‚Äôve been feeling lost and pretty low for the past few years, especially since I had to choose a university and course. Back in 2022, I was interested in Computer Science, so I chose the nearest college that offered a new BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence. In hindsight, I realize the course was more of a marketing tactic ‚Äî using the buzzword \"AI\" to attract students.\n\nThe curriculum focused mainly on basic CS concepts but lacked depth. We skimmed over data structures and algorithms, touched upon C and Java programming superficially, and did a bit more Python ‚Äî but again, nothing felt comprehensive. Even the AI-specific modules like machine learning and deep learning were mostly theoretical, with minimal mathematical grounding and almost no practical implementation. Our professors mostly taught using content from GeeksforGeeks and JavaTpoint. Hands-on experience was almost nonexistent.\n\nThat said, I can‚Äôt blame the college entirely. I was dealing with a lot of internal struggles ‚Äî depression, lack of motivation, and laziness ‚Äî and I didn‚Äôt take the initiative to learn the important things on my own. I do have a few projects under my belt, mostly using OpenAI APIs or basic computer vision models like YOLO. But nothing feels significant. I also don‚Äôt know anything about front-end or back-end development. I‚Äôve just used Streamlit to deploy some college projects.\n\nOver the past three years, I‚Äôve mostly coasted through ‚Äî maintaining a decent GPA but doing very little beyond that. I‚Äôve just finished my third year, and I have one more to go.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm doing a summer internship at a startup as an ML/DL intern, which I‚Äôm honestly surprised I got. The work is mostly R&D with a bit of implementation around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and I‚Äôm actually enjoying it. But it's also been a wake-up call ‚Äî I‚Äôm realizing how little I actually know. I‚Äôm still relying heavily on AI to write most of my code, just like I did for all my previous projects. It‚Äôs scary. I don‚Äôt feel prepared for the job market at all.\n\nI‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve fallen too far behind. The field is so saturated, and there are people out there who are far more talented and driven. I have no fallback plan. I don't know what to do next. I‚Äôd really appreciate any guidance ‚Äî where to start, what skills to focus on, which courses or certifications are actually worth doing. I want to get my act together before it's too late. Honestly, it feels like specializing this early might have been a mistake.",

He's also somehow capable of regularly working into the AM despite having multiple kids, all without swallowing a shotgun\n\nOrdinarily, having a rockstar like this on the team would be a huge asset, the problem is that we got a new PM 2 months ago, and he seems to have made the mistake of calibrating his deliverable expectations off of what wonder boy is capable of. Me and the two other engineers on our team have tried to explain to this guy that we aren't remotely as good as him, and that he'd have to straight up 3x his estimates for any projects he isn't working on. But to no apparent success. He ends up locking us into utterly insane purely self imposed deadlines that have required enormous late night heroics from everyone to complete. And *everything* to him is an emergency and things MUST happen as estimated because he committed us so completely to the various stakeholders, and them to investors, so now everything becomes a high anxiety house fire\n\ni've tried explaining this situation to my direct manager, but he's all aboard the train of trying to figure out how to get everyone else at the same velocity as the chosen one. but its just not going to happen.

I'm aware the job market sucks but I do feel like I'd enjoy it. I like math and computers, and I'm looking for a degree where the skills can be used for creative projects of some kind, outside of work.\n\nBecause of health issues, I don't have¬†much work experience for someone my age (I was on disability for a long time). I'm mostly recovered now, and thankfully my partner would be able to support us if I decided to go to school full time.\n\nBut I would be around 37 when I graduate, so that worries me a bit. I know there are a lot of ageism issues, and that things like internships are important. I also worry that since I already lack a strong work history, spending another 4\\~5 years in school will make for a worse situation with regard to that.\n\nI don't have any lofty career aspirations, but obviously I would still like to find a job after (or during) school. The other degree I'm most interested in is visual art, which I think has even worse career prospects lol.\n\nBasically looking for some guidance on whether it's reasonable to go for CS factoring in my age, sparse resume, the job market, etc. And is the outlook so bad that I should just say F it and go for an art degree instead?? half kidding haha",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I love technology akin to a child who loved going to candy land. That's what made me aspire for the profession. I wanted to be involved in it, specially the software - the coding, testing, studying, whatever else. Basically, I'm a nerd. But reality is harsher and often more disappointing than fantasy. My first job and my current one completely and utterly killed any sort of passion I had for the profession. I was squeezed dry with nothing left to give... and I feel so lost. I've been asking myself the past few months - Where do I go? What should I do?\n\nMy first job was a software dev in a small 50+ company. They say your first job out of college is always an experience, for good or ill, which I agree. I learned a lot and realized some things about myself. I made great memories with my former colleagues. However, more than a year, I was forced to consider the decision to leave due to several reasons - I love coding as much as the next guy but the company is too disorganized. We had to change tech stack twice in just a few months. I also got somewhat disillusioned at the realization that projects never truly end - I love learning as much as the next guy, but all the endless studying that ends up becoming obsolete too quickly... got to me somewhat. It's weird given why I wanted to become a dev in the first place, but it feels like, in a sense, I developed a depression in futility. It's like none of things I did would matter in the next few months. I would've been fine with it. But it's too quickly in my opinion...\n\nMy second job was in a corporate bank as an SRE junior officer. I like how organized it is. How much less pressure there is on me. I can safely take a Leave when necessary without the threat of on-call. Odd because this job IS an on-call. High salary. Great benefits. I also thought trying a different job might grant me new perspective. Switching from development to operations. It's not a total career switching, but it's different enough.\n\nI was optimistic... and got punished for it. After I got regularized, my workload gradually increased. I can normally handle it but the issue is the way things happened.\n\nI currently live in a solo apartment, on-call hybrid setup (just this month, I had to work outside my hours many times, some on weekends). There's so much to learn, so much to do, so much juggle... I *can't*. I can't keep up. I realized a fundamental fact about myself - I'm not a great multitasker. I'm a deep thinker (which is why I aspired to be a dev in the first place). I can multi-task, but not so often and not so fast-paced. It's not sustainable. And now, I'm falling apart.\n\nMy routine was ruined. I don't eat as much. I have inconsistent sleep hours (too few or too much sleep). I don't even leave my apartment in the weekends because I'm too tired and I have housework to do. The salary is great but I doubt it's worth how disorganized I've become. I've become obsessed with completing my tasks. I don't respond to my parents' calls and messages anymore. It hasn't even been a year and I'm already crushed under pressure.\n\nThings became so bad my work performance plummeted - lapses in judgement, slower memory, increasingly \"closed-off\" behavior, breathing problems, headaches, constant exhaustion... I pretty much decided to screw it and go home this weekend. I want to see my family and de-stress. But I know fully well that won't be enough.\n\nI don't know what to do. I want to job hop but even THAT is an effort in itself in my current situation. I'm too tired for it. I took Leave once a month, but it's not enough.\n\nI made enough savings and my family is not financially struggling. My sister already has a job and graduating in a month or two. I feel guilty for the idea nonetheless because I'll become a burden and is using them to cushion me, but I'm so lost.\n\nI also don't know where I want to go, what I want to do. Do I leave IT profession entirely? Or is it a case of having terrible work-life balance and hope the next one would be the golden goose? I'm being pessimistic right now and believe that's just perpetuating the cycle.\n\nI'm at a point where I'd probably be happy with a lower paying job with less stress and pressure on studying off-hours like my experiences forced on me.",

I‚Äôll also work on creating a resume and 2-3 projects , then eventually start applying in late August/early September. I wanted to know if this 11-week plan makes sense and is realistic ‚Äî spending the first 5 weeks learning Python and core programming concepts(ex. Cs50, freecodecamp), then the next 6 weeks focusing on learning dsa/LeetCode and building projects. Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks? \n\nWorst case scenario, I‚Äôm prepared to keep applying until the latest which from what I‚Äôve seen will be January. By then I should hopefully be fully ready for interviews with a complete resume ? I know the importance of applying early in august/early September so I was also wondering if applying in January would even be worth applying since it might be too late. \n\nSorry for the long post, I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot and i feel like more experienced peoples opinion on this would help me gauge my situation better. Any advice or insight from people with knowledge or who‚Äôve been in a similar spot would mean a lot. Thank you!\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm currently working as a junior full-stack developer, but I‚Äôve realized that I enjoy backend development much more. Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been focusing on backend fundamentals to deepen my understanding and prepare for interviews. I‚Äôve revisited and studied in depth key topics like SQL, databases, system design, object-oriented programming, design patterns, relevant networking concepts and important backend (middleware, authentication, authorization, etc...) most of which I had already studied at university. I've also studied lots of interview questions as a way to make sure I didn't miss any core concepts or information regarding those topics.\n\nI practice LeetCode regularly and my resume is in good shape, not exceptional at all since I only have 9 months of work experience, zero internships and 0 unique projects but what I do have is well written.\n\nRight now, I feel a bit lost on what to pursue next. I‚Äôve gone through several backend roadmaps and found that I‚Äôm familiar with most topics (I'm not familiar with Kafka/RabbitMQ for example but that's about the only core thing I found that I didn't know about in the roadmaps) to some degree. For example, I use Docker at work but have never built a container from scratch. I know Redis is used for caching, but I‚Äôve only interacted with it indirectly ‚Äî I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs there but haven‚Äôt configured or used it myself.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt call myself an expert, and while I‚Äôm willing to dive deeper into tools or concepts if the need arises, I don‚Äôt want to study things ‚Äújust to know them.‚Äù Recently, I‚Äôve shifted my mindset to studying topics that genuinely interest me (with the exception of LeetCode, unfortunately). This approach has helped me avoid burnout and actually enjoy learning, I‚Äôve had fun practicing some complex SQL queries and exploring system design lately as an example.\n\nSome options I‚Äôve considered:\n\n* Learning AWS: I‚Äôve only had minimal exposure to AWS. While it's useful and often mentioned in job listings, I don‚Äôt feel drawn to it, especially since I‚Äôm unlikely to use it in personal projects.\n* Building personal projects: I struggle to come up with backend-focused ideas that I‚Äôm genuinely excited about. Most of my current projects aren‚Äôt particularly unique. I tend to use AI for frontend work because I don‚Äôt enjoy it, but I‚Äôd prefer to avoid relying on AI in personal projects as the goal is to improve my skills.\n* Exploring Java & Spring Boot: Since I primarily use the MERN stack, learning Java Spring Boot could open up more job opportunities. I‚Äôve considered making projects with it and creating two tailored resumes (one for Node.js, one for Java). However, the idea of learning a whole new stack solely for the resume is demotivating ‚Äî it feels like something I have to do, not something I want to do. I‚Äôve also heard it‚Äôs better to stick to one stack and get really good at it, and while I‚Äôm not an expert in Node.js, I know it well enough to build things and fill gaps as I go.\n* Learning React.js: This is probably the last thing I want to do which is to learn proper frontend to qualify as full stack engineer instead of using AI for frontend, I really enjoyed frontend at work because it had minimal css and minimal design implementation, most of the time I was working on things related to logic. I've tried to learn react several times before but I just get bored/ lose interest really quickly due to having to implement designs and using css, I enjoy logic just not anything related to styling.\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm looking for direction. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to strengthen my backend skills in a practical or theoretical way, add something to my resume that helps me stand out or both if possible since I'm trying to leave my current job to work more as a backend specialist.",

My thoughts are all over the place. \n\nI have been working for a large bank for nearly 4.5+ years up until now, ever since I graduated from college in May 2020. I was working in a Teradata Dev role nearly 4 years and internally transitioned to on Observability Engineering role about 2 months ago. \n\nI primarily accepted the opportunity to switch internally because it was offering a fat pay raise in my base comp, and I didn‚Äôt want to pigeonhole myself in one tech stack and get chance to learn new skills in the observability world and I also thought this role would be less red tape as my previous role.\n\nBut now 2ish months into my current role, I can see similar patterns of corporate BS from my prior role: shaky communication with scrum masters, shitty documentation, lack of documentation for critical initiatives, a bit of unclear direction in certain tasks I‚Äôm working on, and being thrown into tasks without additional support, slow traction and approval for in POCs which my manager said would be in the pipelines, SREs trying to dump their work on Engineering side. \n\nAmidst this, I feel like I‚Äôm kinda forced and forcing myself to just maintain the optics of seeming like I‚Äôm doing work(proposing new initiatives, exploring self initiated POCs to bring to table, partaking in meetings, asking questions, engaging in code reviews/pull request reviews and trying to do the work assigned me to even if it entails some level of handholding). \n\nMy team manager and tech leads who interviewed me , I clearly told them I don‚Äôt have experience in this stack being used in this role , and despite that they still offered the position and for the most part I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty active in ramping up quickly and continuing to  learn the tech stack used in this role. \n\nBut right now my scrum master is kinda gate keeping some of the deliverables in our engineering team and I feel he‚Äôs sorta pushing tasks to me which he wants to be prioritized more heavily , but those certain tasks  they‚Äôre kinda outta my reach and there‚Äôs very limited internal support to lean onto and shadow along side with them. \n\nAll in all, I really came excited into this new role to really be plugged in to high impact work, with little to no corporate BS, red tape , crystal clear communication, and tasks where new onboarded folks can gradually pick up and ramp . But right now I feel like I‚Äôm thrown into a deep end and barely floating and treading water.  I feel like even though I‚Äôve delivered some tasks and my tech leads are supportive, my scrum master assigns certain in which there‚Äôs no meaningful documentation on nor internal support and I can‚Äôt seem to move much forward without butting heads into him (in a neutral manner)\n\nOverall what I‚Äôm trying to convey is , I feel like shit and I think I‚Äôm going to be perceived as a phony , regardless of how proactively I‚Äôm putting effort in.\n\nThis is really taxing and taking a toll on my confidence in how I can deliver in a highly regulated ass environment like banking. Id really like to jump ship by next 4ish-6ish months by the end of the year and would love to work outside a banking environment , preferably a startup or industry outside of banking altogether.\n\nI need help fam. Idk what I just spilled. For those of whom were in similar situation or circumstances as me, what did you do ? Did you move out to a different industry altogether or a startup ? Is it possible to avoid these in a startup \n\n",

Thing is, I keep hearing about layoffs constantly happening at these top tech companies so even if I do get it, I feel like I will be completely stressed the whole time due to job security. This has me second guessing if I want to put the time and effort in to study/interview here. I have 9 years of experience right now and currently employed but I know having this at my resume will help in the long run and the pay increase will probably be much more. \n\nWould you take up a MAANG offer if you have a easy comfortable job in today's economy and layoff situations?",

When should I start applying to the major defense contractors in this area? Additionally, what skills are relevant in this field?\n\nFor tailoring the resume, should I be looking through each job description, picking out key skills from it, and finding those skills in my resume and provide relevant projects for it?\n\nWhen it comes to quantity/quality of applications, I really want to narrow it down, but I need to do more than I have in the past. Last year I applied to around 80 and got 2 responses back. How do I balance quantity and quality?\n\nAny general advice?",
