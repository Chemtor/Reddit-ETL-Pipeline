So much stuff as a data engineer is completely out of your control but you're expected to just fix it. People constantly question numbers if it doesn't match their vibes. Nobody understands the complexities. It's also so, so hard to test in the same concrete way as regular services and applications.\n\nData teams are also largely full of non-technical people. I regularly have to argue with/convince people that basic things like source control are necessary.

Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?\n\nMaybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as \"table stakes\" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was \"Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that.\" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?\n\nI think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:\n\n* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.\n* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.\n* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \\`join\\` logic from being repeated in multiple places.\n   * Not to mention general \\`join\\` efficiency\n* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \\`join\\`s should work.\n\nI'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.\n\nFull disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all. But I'll certainly give credit to all you r/dataengineers.",

        "content": "Dear Fellow Data Engineer,\n\nI've been doing data for about 15 years (mostly in data analytics and data leadership - so not hardcore DE, but had DEs reporting to me). Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.\n\nFor example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.\n\nThey would create \n\n* the User entity\n* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)\n* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the two\n\nAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.\n\nDo you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.\n\nI understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.\n\nTheir progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",

All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. \nThere’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.\n\nTo make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.\n\n\nFor context, my background is:\n\n•\t~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)\n\n•\t~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks\n\n•\tComfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)\n\nI joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here.

        "author": "roey132",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Continuing my latest post about vibe coding as a data engineer.\n\nin case you missed - I am trying to make a bunch of projects ASAP to show potential freelance clients demos of what I can make for them because I don't have access to former projects from my workplaces.\n\nSo, In my last demo project, I created a daily patch data on AWS using Lambda, Glue, S3 and Athena.\n\nusing this project, I created my next project, a demo BI Dashboard as an example of how to use data to show insights using your data infra.\n\nNote: I did not try to make a very insightful dashboard, as this is a simple tech demo to show potential.\n\nA few takes from the current project:\n\n1. After taking some notes from my last project, the workflow with AI felt much smoother, and I felt more in control over my prompts and my expectations of what it can provide me.\n\n2. This project was much simpler (tech wise). Much less tools, most of the project is only in python, which makes it easier for the AI to follow on the existing setup and provide better solutions and fixes.\n\n3. Some tasks just feels frustrating with AI even when you expect it to be very simple. (for example, no matter what I did, it couldn't make a list of my CSV column names, it just couldn't manage it, very weird.)\n\n4. When not using UI tools (like in AWS console for example), the workflow feels more right. you are much less likely to get hallucinations (which happened A LOT on AWS console)\n\n5. For the data visualization enthusiasts amongst us, I believe making graph settings for matplotlib and alike using AI is the biggest game changer I felt since coding with it. it saves SO MUCH time remembering what settings exists for each graph and plot type, and how to set them correctly.\n\nGithub repo: [https://github.com/roey132/streamlit\\_dashboard\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/streamlit_dashboard_demo)\n\nStreamlit demo link: [https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/](https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/)\n\n  \nI believe this project was a lot easier to vibe code because its much smaller and less complex than the daily batch pipeline. that said, it does help me understand more about the potential and risks of vibe coding, and let's me understand better when to trust AI (in its current form) and when to doubt it's responses.\n\nto summarize:  when working on a project that doesn't have a lot of different environments and tools (this time, 90% python), the value of vibe coding is much higher. also, learning to make your prompts better and more informative can improve the final product a lot, but, still, the AI takes a lot of assumptions when providing answers, and you can't always provide it with 100% of the information and edge cases, which makes it provide very wrong solutions. Understanding what the process should look like and knowing what to expect of your final product is key to make a useful and steady app.\n\nI will continue to share my process on my next project in hope it can help anyone! \n\n(Also, if you have any cool idea to try for my next project, please let me know! i'm open for ideas)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm currently working with a medallion architecture inside Fabric and would love to hear how others handle the **raw → bronze** process, especially when mixing **incremental and full loads**.\n\nHere’s a short overview of our layers:\n\n* **Raw**: Raw data from different source systems\n* **Bronze (technical layer)**: Raw data enriched with technical fields like `business_ts`, `primary_hash`, `payload_hash`, etc.\n* **Silver**: Structured and modeled data, aggregated based on our business model\n* **Gold**: Smaller, consumer-oriented aggregates for dashboards, specific departments, etc.\n\nIn the **raw → bronze** step, a colleague taught me to create two hashes:\n\n* `primary_hash`: to uniquely identify a record (based on business keys)\n* `payload_hash`: to detect if a record has changed\n\nWe’re using Delta Tables in the bronze layer and the logic is:\n\n* **Insert** if the `primary_hash` does not exist\n* **Update** if the `primary_hash` exists but the `payload_hash` has changed\n* **Delete** if a `primary_hash` from a previous load is missing in the current extraction\n\nThis logic works well *if* we always had a full load.\n\nBut here's the issue: our source systems deliver **a mix of full and incremental loads**, and in incremental mode, we might only get a tiny fraction of all records. With the current implementation, that results in **95% of the data being deleted**, even though it's still valid – it just wasn't part of the incremental pull.\n\nNow I'm wondering:  \nOne idea I had was to **add a boolean flag** (e.g. `is_current`) to mark if the record was seen in the latest load, along with a `last_loaded_ts` field. But then the question becomes:  \n**How can I determine if a record is still “active” when I only get partial (incremental) data and no full snapshot to compare against?**\n\nAnother aspect I’m unsure about is **data retention and storage costs**.  \nThe idea was to **keep the full history of records** permanently, so we could go back and see what the data looked like at a certain point in time (e.g., *\"What was the state on 2025-01-01?\"*). But I’m concerned this could lead to **massive storage costs over time**, especially with large datasets.\n\nHow do you handle this in practice?\n\n* Do you keep historical records in Bronze or move history handling to Silver/Gold?\n* Do you archive older data somewhere else?\n* How do you balance auditability and cost?\n\nThanks in advance for any input! I'd really appreciate hearing how others are approaching this kind of problem or i'm the only Person.\n\nThanks a lot!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys. I recently completed an ETL project that I've been longing to complete and I finally have something presentable. It's an ETL pipeline and dashboard to pull, process and push the data into my dimensionally modeled Postgres database and I've used Streamlit to visualize the data.\n\n  \nThe steps:  \n1. Data Extraction: I used the Fotmob API to extract all the match ids and details in the English Premier League in nested json format using the ip-rotator library to bypass any API rate limits.\n\n2. Data Storage: I dumped all the json files from the API into a GCP bucket. (around 5k json files)\n\n3. Data Processing: I used DataProc to run the spark jobs (used 2 spark workers) of reading the data and inserting the data into the staging tables in postgres. (all staging tables are truncate and load)\n\n4. Data Modeling: This was the most fun part about the project as I understood each aspect of the data, what I have, what I do not and at what level of granularity I need to have to avoid duplicates in the future. Have dim tables (match, player, league, date) and fact tables (3 of them for different metric data for match and player, but contemplating if I need a lineup fact).  Used generate\\_series for the date dimension. Added insert, update date columns and also added sequences to the targer dim/fact tables.\n\n5. Data Loading: After dumping all the data into the stg tables, I used a merge query to insert/update if the key id exists or not. I created SQL views on top of these tables to extract the relevant information I need for my visualizations. The database is Supabase PostgreSQL.\n\n6. Data Visualization: I used Streamlit to showcase the matplotlib, plotly and mplsoccer (soccer-specific visualization) plots. There are many more visualizations I can create using the data I have.\n\nI used Airflow for orchestrating the ETL pipelines (from extracting data, creating tables, sequences if they don't exist, submitting pyspark scripts to the gcp bucket to run on dataproc, and merging the data to the final tables), Terraform to manage the GCP services (terraform apply and destroy, plan and fmt are cool) and  Docker for containerization. \n\n  \nThe Streamlit dashboard is [live here](https://pldashboard.streamlit.app/) and [Github ](https://github.com/karthikgarimella37/EPL_Fotmob)as well. I am open to any feedback, advice and tips on what I can improve in the pipeline and visualizations. My future work is to include more visualizations, add all the leagues available in the API and learn and use dbt for testing and sql work.\n\n  \nCurrently, I'm looking for any entry-level data engineering/data analytics roles as I'm a recent MS data science graduate and have 2 years of data engineering experience. If there's more I can do to showcase my abilities, I would love to learn and implement them. If you have any advice on how to navigate such a market, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you've reached this point. I appreciate it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4mq029q72ef1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf3e8129c1a144e78b1decf32642278afc1e24f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m13gy8q72ef1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=526ebcad5616d0bfcb1c6e4a8357cd6833c06d97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj70pv8q72ef1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b2094bb13d30c8a6b33798905f128b5c88f162\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/617odx8q72ef1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef3bb7184eb9d012de8c9979df5c0da15be80b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c42efw8q72ef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6660c876a1487b5c7a313afbd28b90776a7dd64\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ynyb59q72ef1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0433856dacc83622fd06f4aa6be764e688d554a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvu3lw8q72ef1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=646dec3a6e11b8c268fc91a196eb8ad0d149ef59\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7v98w8q72ef1.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=16180537c5ef391bea1f73619b68c75c4763f0c7\n\n",

        "content": "After months of research and testing after i had a project to classify data into categories of a large 10m records dataset in [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lk78ub/the_nightmare_of_de_processing_free_text_input/), and apart from that the data had many typos, what i only knew is that it comes from online forms which candidates type their degree name, but many typed some junk, typos, all sort of things that you can imagine\n\nTo get an idea, here is a sample of the data:\n\n    id, degree\n    1, technician in public relations\n    2, bachelor in business management\n    3, high school diploma\n    4, php\n    5, dgree in finance\n    6, masters in cs\n    7, mstr in logisticss\n\nSome of you suggested to use an LLM, or AI, some recommended to check Levenshtein distance\n\nI tried fuzzy matching and many things, so i came up with this plan to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. Use 3 layers of spelling corrections using words from a bag of clean words with: word2vec, 2 layers of Levenshtein distance\n2. Create a master table of all degrees out there over 600 degrees\n3. Tokenize the free text input column, the degrees column from master table, crossjoin them and creacte a match score with the amount of matching words from the text column against the master data column\n4. To this point for each row it will have many cnadidates, so we're picking the degree name in which has the highest amount of matching words against the text column\n5. The output of this method tested with a portion of 500k records, and with 600 degrees in master table, we got over 75% matching score which means we found the equivalent degree name for 75% of the text records, it can be improved by adding more degree names, modify confidence %, and train the model with more data\n\nThis method combines 2 ML models, and finds the best matching degree name against each line\n\nThe output would be like this:\n\n    id, degree\n    1, technician in public relations, degree in public relations\n    2, bachelor in business management, bachelors degree in business management\n    3, high school diploma, high school degree\n    4, php, degree in software development\n    5, dgree in finance, degree in finance\n    6, masters in cs, masters degree in computer science\n    7, mstr in logisticss, masters degree in logistics\n\nI made it as a Python library based on PySpark which doesn't require any comercial LLM AI APIs ... fully open source, so that anyone that struggles with the same issue can use the library directly to save time and headaches\n\nYou can find the library on PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/](https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/)\n\nOr install it directly\n\n`pip install pynlpclassifier`\n\nI made an [article ](https://medium.com/@hamzahbdeveloper/introducing-pynlpclassifier-correct-the-spelling-and-categorize-large-free-text-input-data-using-da1a93408f30)explainning in depth the library, the functions, and an example of use case\n\nI hope you found my research work helpfull and that can be useful to share with the community.",

        "content": "TL;DR  \nWe’re in the parking industry, running Talend Open Studio + PostgreSQL + shell scripts (all self-hosted). It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.\n\nFiguring out:\n\n* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation\n* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant\n* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\n\n\\---\n\nHey all!\n\nWe’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.\n\n# Current setup:\n\n* PostgreSQL (\\~80–100GB per customer, growing \\~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area\n* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)\n* Shell scripts for orchestration\n* Tableau Server\n* ETL approach\n* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat files\n\nWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.\n\n# Why we’re moving on:\n\nTalend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.\n\nAdditionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.\n\nWe have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.\n\nWe’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words \"modern this, cloud that\", etc...  \nBut we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.\n\nWe’re trying to build something that:\n\n* Actually works for our use case\n* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible\n* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant\n* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire\n\n# Our modernization idea:\n\n* Python + PySpark for pipelines\n* ELT instead of ETL\n* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one\n* Airflow for orchestration\n* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical\n* Great Expectations for data validation\n* Vault for secrets\n* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment\n* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging\n* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.\n\nAll self-hosted and open-source (for now).\n\n# The big question: architecture\n\nStill not sure whether to go:\n\n* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)\n* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)\n\nOur sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.\n\nI believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a \"product\" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.\n\n# Questions for the community:\n\n* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?\n* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?\n* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?\n* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?\n* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?\n* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?\n\nWe’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.\n\nAppreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights. \n\nCheers!",

My biggest obstacle is the lack of hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure, which most job listings require.\n\nI have solid experience with Python, PySpark, SQL, and building ETL pipelines — but all in on-premise environments using Hadoop, HDFS, etc. I’ve never had the opportunity to work in the cloud project, and I can’t afford paid courses, certifications, or bootcamps right now.\n\nI’m feeling really stuck and honestly a bit desperate. I know I have potential, but I just don’t know how to bridge this gap. I’d truly appreciate any advice, free resources, project ideas, or anything that could help me move forward.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and support.",

Unfortunately, having OWNERSHIP  also allows these analysts to drop, create and alter objects which are inappropriate privileges for most of them.   Also, transferring ownership of Snowflake objects to many new roles is complicated and can effectively  break views for end users and change our \"future\" role assignments.   I wish there was a METADATA privilege that was dedicated to allowing the creation and management of object metadata, but there isn't.   Does anyone know of a work-around?

        "content": "I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.\n\n1. \n\n>Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change \"atomic\" within a single transaction.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as \"RUN\", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.\n\nWhat is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations?  \nI do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK.   \nLogically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?\n\n2. \n\nI am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers.  \nThat is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct?\n\n    databaseChangeLog:\n      - changeSet:\n          id: periods-log-trigger\n          author: XYZ\n          runOnChange: true\n          changes:\n            - sqlFile:\n                path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql\n            - sqlFile:\n                path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql\n          rollback:\n            - sql:\n                sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()\n\n\n\n3. \n\nBack to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.\n\nBecause createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is  dropped?\n\nThanks everyone!",

I’m thinking this may be useful for:\n\n* real-time dashboards\n* lookups on pre-processed datasets\n* quick queries for larger model training\n* potentially even just general analytics queries for small/mid sized companies\n\nThere's a (very minimal) MVP up at [www.warpdb.io](http://www.warpdb.io) with playground if people want to fiddle. Not exactly sure where to take it from here, I mostly wanted to prove it's possible, and well, it is! :D\n\nVery open to any thoughts / feedback / discussions, would love to hear what the community thinks!\n\nCheers,  \nPhil",

        "author": "backend-dev",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "What is a good approach when you want to insert an audit record into a table using dbt & Snowflake? \nThe audit record should be atomic with the actual data that was inserted, but because dbt does not support Snowflake transactions, this seems not possible. My thoughts are to insert the audit record in the post-hook, but if the audit record insert fails for some reason, my audit and actual data will be out of sync.\n\nWhat is the best approach to get around this limitation.\n\nI did try to add begin transaction as the first pre-hook and commit as the last post-hook, but although it works, it is hacky and then locks the table if there is a failure due to no rollback being executed.\n\nEDIT: Some more info\n\nMy pipeline will run every 4 hours or thereabouts and the target table will grow fairly large (already >1B rows). I am trying strategies for saving on cost (minimising bytes scanned, etc).\n\nThe source data has an updated_at field and in the dbt model I use: select from source where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) from target). The select max(updated_at) from target is computed from metadata, so is quite efficient (0 bytes scanned).\n\nI want to gather stats and audit info (financial data) for each of my runs. E.g. min(updated_at), max(updated_at), sum(some_value) & rowcount of each incremental load. Each incremental load does have a unique uid, so one could query from the target table after append, but that is likely going to scan a lot of data.\n\nTo mitigate against having to scan the target table for run stats, my thoughts were to stage the increment using a separate dbt model ('staging'). This staging model will stage the increment as a new table, extract the audit info from the staged increment and write the audit log. Then another model ('append') will append the staged increment to the target table. There are a few issues with this as well, including re-staging a new increment before the previous increment was appended. But I have ways around that, but it relies on the fact that audit records for both the staging runs and append runs are correctly and reliably inserted. Hence the question.",

        "author": "warleyco96",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'd love to get your opinion and feedback on a large-scale architecture challenge.\n\n**Scenario:** I'm designing a near-real-time data platform for over 300 tables, with the constraint of using **only the native Databricks ecosystem** (no external tools).\n\n**The Core Dilemma:** I'm trying to decide between using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and building a **Custom Framework**.\n\nMy initial evaluation of DLT suggests it might struggle with some of our critical data manipulation requirements, such as:\n\n1. **More Options of Data Updating on Silver and Gold tables:**\n   1. **Full Loads:** I haven't found a native way to do a Full/Overwrite load in Silver. I can only add a TRUNCATE as an operation at position 0, simulating a CDC. In some scenarios, it's necessary for the load to always be full/overwrite.\n   2. **Partial/Block Merges:** The ability to perform complex partial updates, like deleting a block of records based on a business key and then inserting the new block (no primary-key at row level).\n2. **Merge for specific columns:** The environment tables have metadata columns used for lineage and auditing. Columns such as first\\_load\\_author and update\\_author, first\\_load\\_author\\_external\\_id and update\\_author\\_external\\_id, first\\_load\\_transient\\_file, update\\_load\\_transient\\_file, first\\_load\\_timestamp, and update\\_timestamp. For incremental tables, for existing records, only the update columns should be updated. The first\\_load columns should not be changed.\n\nMy perception is that DLT doesn't easily offer this level of granular control. Am I mistaken here? I'm new to this resource. I couldn't find any real-world examples for product scenarios, just some basic educational examples.\n\nOn the other hand, I considered a model with one continuous stream per table but quickly ran into the \\~145 execution context limit per cluster, making that approach unfeasible.\n\n**Current Proposal:** My current proposed solution is the reactive architecture shown in the image below: a central \"router\" detects new files and, via the Databricks Jobs API, triggers small, ephemeral jobs (using `AvailableNow`) for each data object.\n\n**My Question for the Community:** What are your thoughts on this event-driven pattern? Is it a robust and scalable solution for this scenario, or is there a simpler or more efficient approach within the Databricks ecosystem that I might be overlooking?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znq1swylp3ef1.png?width=5661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7a4d4ac35f7803c4aa1576a7f70d5cc641429a\n\nThe architecture above illustrates the Oracle source with AWS DMS. This scenario is simple because it's CDC. However, there's user input in files, SharePoint, Google Docs, TXT files, file shares, legacy system exports, and third-party system exports. These are the most complex writing scenarios that I couldn't solve with DLT, as mentioned at the beginning, because they aren't CDC, some don't have a key, and some have partial merges (delete + insert).\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or experiences you can share!",

Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).\nData in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. \n\nPrimarily, the changes that we want to track are: \n1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time 🥲)\n2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)\n3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)\n4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. \n\nTo do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. \n\nThis what I tried so far:\n1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/\"expectations\";\n2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). \n3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. \n\nAm I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described? Or is the market really overloaded with stuff that says that it does everything, while in fact does do squat?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nBit of a newbie question for all you veterans.\n\nWe're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.\n\nSo far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.\n\nThat said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?\n\nCurious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",

        "author": "AmbitiousMagazine846",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working in architecture and urban planning for about 6–7 years now, and honestly, I’m burnt out. The environment is draining, the market is saturated, the pay is low, and growing into senior roles feels nearly impossible unless you tolerate long-term toxicity, unpaid competitions, and constant deadline stress.\n\nI studied and worked in Germany, and I’m at a point where I’m seriously considering a shift. I’ve always had an interest in:\n\t•\tCoding\n\t•\tData\n\t•\tTrends and analysis\n\t•\tLogical thinking\n\nAt the same time, I’ve always had a creative eye. I care a lot about user experience — not just in buildings or cities, but in how people interact with things in general. That’s what drew me to look into Product Design and Data Analytics as possible career paths.\n\nThe thing is, job listings for data analytics seem higher in Germany. Product design roles are fewer, which makes me nervous. But I’m worried:\n\t•\tWill product design be just another draining, underpaid creative field like architecture?\n\t•\tWill data analytics be too dry or rigid long term?\n\t•\tAnd realistically, which path is better for career growth and salary in the long run?\n\nI’m not expecting overnight success, but I also don’t want to be stuck at a junior/mid salary range forever. I’m trying to find something where I can grow steadily, have a healthier work-life balance, and still enjoy what I do.\n\nIf anyone here has made the leap from architecture to either field (or knows someone who did), I’d love to hear what made the difference for you, and what you’d recommend.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏🏼 ",

        "content": "We're trying to get away from our legacy DE tool, BO Data Services. A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. \n\nOur app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.\n\nWe'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.\n\nWe've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).\n\nBefore we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.\n\nFor more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

I only do light development (not full-stack) like that for business need (quite adhoc and change constantly)\n\nI really want to learn more about the data perspective (how to build a database, how all the threading, concurrency etc.. work behind the scene). Try a couple of investigation online and come across this course from CMU which is like golden source on how to start to understand database at very deep level [https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/) I spent a couple of days to deep dive the course material, but, to be honest it's way above my level, tackling this is not efficient yet.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how to start properly and slowly gain knowledge required. My goal is in 1 or 2 year, I will be able to tackle above course (by myself via online lecture/youtube and doing all pet projects only) and be-able to build some kind of database myself at work (i can ask for more task from the team which is database-related, even hardware-related).\n\n  \nI have background in Python (let say 8/10, I can read and understand python core package and syntax). Learning C++ (still struggle with intermediate concept like lvalue/rvalue,  how to use smart pointers properly etc.). Write SQL on daily basis but i guess it's not useful yet (work comfortably with CTE for example or stored procedure).\n\n  \nReally appreciate your help!",

        "author": "planesforstars",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Last year, I found myself in a familiar cycle: I'd watch a tutorial, follow along perfectly, feel like a programming genius... then completely freeze when faced with a blank editor and a real problem to solve. I knew the syntax. I could explain concepts. But I couldn't *build* anything meaningful without a step-by-step guide.\n\nSound familiar? I've come to call this the competent imposter phase - where you understand enough to recognize good code, but not enough to produce it independently.\n\n# The Gap No One Talks About\n\nI've noticed a pattern in programming education that no one seems to address directly: there's a massive cognitive leap between understanding code and generating it. It's like knowing all the rules of chess but having no strategic intuition. You know how the pieces move, but you can't see the patterns that make a good player.\n\nAfter months of frustration, I decided to approach this problem systematically. Here's what I discovered works:\n\n# 1. Reverse Engineering > Tutorials\n\nInstead of watching more tutorials, I started downloading open-source projects that were *just* beyond my skill level. Not massive frameworks, but small utilities with 300-1000 lines of code.\n\nThe process: Run the program to understand what it does Read through the code without judgment Delete small sections and try to reimplement them Gradually expand what I deleted until I could recreate substantial portions\n\nThis forced me to think like the original developer rather than just consuming their finished work.\n\n# 2. The Tiny Feature Technique\n\nOne of my breakthroughs came when I stopped trying to build complete applications. Instead, I focused on adding tiny features to existing code:\n\n* Take a simple calculator app and add a history feature Add dark mode to a static website Implement a simple search function in a list app\n\nThis approach gave me the scaffolding to work within while still requiring creative problem-solving.\n\n# 3. Deliberate Debugging Practice\n\nI started intentionally breaking working code, then fixing it. This might sound counterproductive, but it taught me to read error messages properly and understand how the pieces fit together.\n\nI'd introduce a bug, wait 24 hours (so I'd forget exactly what I changed), then come back and fix it. This simulated the real-world experience of debugging unfamiliar code.\n\n# 4. The Explain It To A Beginner Test\n\nAfter implementing something, I forced myself to write an explanation as if teaching it to someone who just started coding. This revealed gaps in my understanding that weren't apparent when I was just following along with tutorials.\n\nIf I couldn't explain a concept clearly, I knew I needed to revisit it.\n\n# 5. Embracing Uncomfortable Tools\n\nI noticed I was avoiding certain technologies because they felt intimidating. For me, this was working with APIs and asynchronous code.\n\nSo I created a rule: at least once a week, I'd work on something that made me uncomfortable. Not to master it immediately, but to reduce the anxiety around it.\n\n# The Mental Shift That Changed Everything\n\nThe biggest change came when I stopped thinking of programming as knowing things and started seeing it as figuring things out.\n\nExperienced developers aren't successful because they've memorized everything - they're successful because they've developed robust mental models for approaching new problems. They know how to break down complex tasks, research effectively, and test their assumptions.\n\n# My Practical Advice\n\n1. **Create a Learning Project** \\- A single, evolving project you keep enhancing as you learn new concepts. Mine was a personal book tracking app that grew from a command-line tool to a web app over 6 months.\n2. **Code Review Yourself** \\- After completing something, wait a week, then review your own code as if it was written by someone else. Be critical but constructive.",

Wow, I would NEVER have thought of how to do this, but once I saw the code it looked super easy. If someone walked me through how to do this in English, like \"define array, define object, write for loop for array, write conditional to check object for current word, and if it's in the array increment the word's count in the object by one, but if it's not then input the integer \"1\" for that word in the object because it's the first time it's occurred in the array...\" I'd be able to do it.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm a relatively new teacher at a high school (15-17 y/o's), and I teach programming. The subject only has one 40-minute class a week per group, **with no option for giving them homework or anything outside of class hours**.\n\nI first learned programming with Unity and C#, and that's what I want to try with them. I think static typing and having an interface is a good way to teach programming, and game dev simply sounds more fun. I tried it already for a few months last year, it didn't really work out, it was too confusing for them. But I still want to give it a shot. (Especially now that I'm actually going to have a fucking projector so they can see my screen). (Hopefully). (Yes this is not a very high-budget school).\n\nThe idea is to teach them the very basics C# (variables, conditionals, functions, maybe arrays and loops), and have them play with the basic Unity components (sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, and basic GUI). No OOP (except to interact with components). No 3D. No fuss. But even that sounds like too much for our restrictions, with my limited experience.\n\nSo, how would you approach giving a class like that? I don't know if this is the right place, but I really don't know where else to post this.\n\nI'm not married to the idea of Unity or gamedev though, I'm open to suggestions. But it has to be something interactive and graphical so they're interested. Bear in mind these are high-schoolers, most of them aren't interested in programming, and the class is only there to kind of teach them how computers work and how to think systematically.\n\nSome other things I've thought of:\n\n* Tkinter: don't love the idea of dynamically-typed Python, and not that engaging\n* Godot: interface more confusing than Unity's imo\n* Pygame: even if it's simpler, no GUI at all is arguably way harder\n* Arduino: really cool idea and easier programming, but obviously we'd need Arduinos, which we don't have, and emulators like TinkerCAD just aren't the same\n* Java forms on NetBeans: not that engaging\n\nI'd love to hear any insight or suggestions whatsoever, especially if any of you have been teachers.",

It's cool to play games and conceptualize what they did to make an effect happen. It's totally worth it to learn how to code. It took me 3 tries to go from scratch (the online game making site) to unity (a professional game engine). Then it took me 2-3 years to make a commercial game. And now I'm learning web dev and it's soooo much easier then starting from scratch. I love understanding this alien language.  Good luck to anyone and everyone trying to do the same! It's hard but so cool.",

I'll start a project in python with a basic idea on what i want it to be, but just get instantly stuck and have no idea how to progress.

I went through psychological therapy and recently surgery so I cant physically move excessively at the moment.\n\nPlease dont delete this I just want to ask for an advice. \nI dont have any Exp in computer science.\nI play games as a hobby.\nI just need something as a leisure like me learning Japanese at the moment.\nThank u \\.( ^_^ )./ \n\nEdit : Hey guys Just wanting to update you. First off, Thanks for all of the help you guys provided. I'm still reading a lot of them and very sorry if I can't reply on all of it.\n\nSecond, I decided to stick to C# and check the waters again and probably give it a week and if not I'm switching to Python and if that still sucks like someone commented just stick with C.\n\nNow the IDE, I can't use VStudio cause I'm using Mint. I used jetbrains before but my oh my that IDE is so laggy in my Computer ( I told you computer is ass! ). A lot of people commented on Vim & Neovim. Now, I know those two are good and maybe you can also include LazyVim but I am just a beginner. I don't even know how to use a library let alone customising Vim to make it in a IDE. So Im at VS code at the moment.\n\nA lot of you guys are too good for me xD.\nVim is nice cause you don't really need to use a mouse whenever you code. It will be a lot faster just using the keyboard but it has steep learning curve y' know just like playing Dark souls. It takes a while and I just want to learn a language before I can jump to Vim.\n\nI know this edit is a long ass speech of drama but I really appreciate the help! \n",

        "content": "I have been using Codefinity for a few weeks and wanted to share my honest review. Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.\n\n\n\nThat said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.\n\n\n\nJust to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.\n\n\n\nI’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time. Did you find that the content goes beyond beginner level and really builds useful skills? Do you think it’s worth continuing with, or are there better platforms out there for someone looking to grow step by step? I would appreciate hearing your experiences. Thanks!",

        "content": "I am 24 and have an associate's degree (2 years) in Computer Science. I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD.   \nI am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years.  \nI love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education.  \nHowever, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities.  \nThe reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.\n\nSo I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.\n\nTL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job. Is it worth perusing a bachelors degree in CS?",

Do you feel like personal projects have been useful for getting new jobs after two years or so past graduation?

Is a really cool working compiler essentially useless for a backend role? Will your cool NeoVim plugin elicit only blank stares during a fullstack interview?

        "content": "**NOTE:** I made that post in r/Unicode as well, but as that community is both small and not programming related, I'm posting here to have more chances to get an answer.\n\nI am trying to implement code for Unicode and, I was just checking the [available codes](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/) and while everything was going well, when I reached to the 4-byte codes, things started pissing me off. So, I would expect that the latest codes will not be defined, as Unicode has not yet used all the available numbers for the 4-byte range. So for now, I'll just check the latest available one and update my code in new Unicode versions.\n\nNow, here is the bizarre thing... For some reason, there are undefined codes BETWEEN sets! For some reason, the people who design and implement Unicode decided to leave some codes empty and then, continue normally! For example, the codes between [adlam](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#adlam) and [indic-siyaq-numbers](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#indic-siyaq-numbers) are not defined. What's even more crazy is that in some sets themselves, there are undefined codes. One example is the set [ethiopic-extended-b](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#ethiopic-extended-b) which has about 3 codes not defined.\n\nBecause of that, what would be just a simple \"start/end\" range check, it will now have to be done with an array that has different ranges. That means more work for me to implement and worse performance to the programs that will use that code.\n\nWith all that in mind, unless there is a reason that they implemented it that way and someone knows and can tell me, I will have my code consider the undefined codes as valid and just be done with it and everyone that has a problem can just complain to the Unicode organization to fix their mess...",

That being said, I did try my hardest, and it is my first project. Oversimplified, my System uses fire science equations, a grid representing terrain, and some custom graph traversal algorithms to predict how a fire spreads across different terrain under different conditions, allowing the user to select a starting position and fire-start position to start the simulation. I posted it on LinkedIn but like, nobody really cared enough to actually look at it and give me feedback lol.\n\nI'm hoping I'd find people here willing to critique it. I am not planning on building it out again, my next step is a multi-agent disaster response simulation, but I feel like any advice on how I could have made this project better would help me in the long run\n\nThank you!",

However, I am struggling to find roles that I feel I would be suited for. I know that what I like is more low-level stuff (specifically C++), and that I don't really have any interest in web development or working in the traditional \"big tech\" companies, which I feel like are the dominant hiring fields for new grads. I think embedded systems would be a good fit for me, or possibly programming for telecom (though maybe that's also just embedded systems?). I will have a few decently-sized resume projects under my belt by graduation, and one will hopefully be done by the end of the summer for earlier application deadlines. I'm also interested in AI, but more of the mathematical/backend stuff (i.e. being one of the people working on PyTorch itself or developing new models, not just using PyTorch to create a CNN or something).\n\nSo, my questions: What kind of things should I be looking for as I search for job postings online? When I'm looking for alumni from my school to connect with, what kind of roles should I be looking for them to have? What skills should I be developing over the next year to get a position like the one I want? (Also, any other general advice from people who have been on a similar path is appreciated).",

        "author": "MasterSkillz",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I've been programming for around 2-3 years and I'm currently doing Linux Kernel programming at my internship.\n\nThe way i started CS (and fell in love with it) was by self-studying Berkeley's CS61a in my senior year of high school. I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.\n\nMy 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:\n\nFirst, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.\n\nHow does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. \n\nFor those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS? I only know of my journey so I'm curious to hear about others.\n\nThanks",

I don’t have much technical knowledge yet, I’m still learning the basics of JavaScript and web development but I wanted to learn by building something real.

The idea is to make a browser extension that can help prevent online fraud like phishing, fake KYC forms, and credential theft by giving users real-time warnings when they’re doing risky things like entering passwords, uploading documents, or clicking suspicious links. I also want to create a simple backend that collects reports about scammy websites and gives each site a kind of “trust score” based on how many users flagged it. I’m honestly not sure how feasible or practical the idea is, or if I’m completely off track  so I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, or criticism from the community (or even roasts lol), especially around feasibility, gaps in the idea, or suggestions for what I should read, learn, or improve. This is my way of learning by doing, and I’d be grateful for any help.\n\nIf anyone has resources, beginner-friendly guides, or thoughts on how I could actually make the detection/warning parts work in a real browser extension, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**TL;DR**: I’m a beginner learning JavaScript & web dev, trying to build a browser extension (SafeSign++) to warn users in real-time about scams and phishing.

After each new concept is introduced (that you're not yet familiar with), whether that's a function, API, keyword, whatever, as soon as the concept is introduced, jump to a Notes document (wherever you happen to take notes: Notepad, CherryTree, Word Doc, Google Doc, whatever it is), and write down the name of the thing.  Once the tutorial finishes with that concept, pause it. Go look up whatever it is in the relevant documentation. Read the documentation on that thing. In your notes, write down (in your own words) what you understand about that concept under it: how it's used, arguments, when you used it, what you understand the documentation to mean, etc. Continue in this way until you finish the tutorial. Reread all your notes once the tutorial is over.\n\nSecond: Do the tutorial again. But start completely fresh. This time, when you get to each new concept, pause the video and try to finish that section completely on your own. Refer to your notes as necessary. If you can't get it working, go back to the tutorial and watch it and do it the way it says. If you make a mistake, revise your notes so that they more clearly explain the concept. If you get it right, rewatch that section of the tutorial and see if your predicted way of getting it to work is the same, or if you did it in a slightly different way. If you did it differently but it still worked, make note of this as an alternative way that also worked. Once the tutorial is over, reread all your notes again.\n\nThird: Use each concept from the tutorial in a completely independent way. If you learned 30 concepts, make 30 micro projects focused on those concepts. Use them for something completely different. If two or more concepts depend on each other, combine them as needed. But review the docs and see if they can be used independently, or combined in different ways. \n\nFourth: Do a big, similar project completely on your own that uses the concepts you've learned but in a different way. Review your notes and the documentation as necessary. \n\nIf you do future tutorials, jump right to the second step: as you do them, rather than following along mindlessly, for each new concept, try to do it on your own. As a new concept starts to be introduced, pause it and try to think about how you'd do it. If you can't, review your notes and see if anything jumps out. If there's still nothing, treat it as going back to the First Step, and watch the tutorial and update your notes, review the documentation, etc. Otherwise, have two parallel projects going: the way this new tutorial does it, and the way you'd do it. For the \"your way\" version, keep it going with your way as long as you can, even if it diverges significantly from the \"tutorial way\" version. If at some point your version just won't work anymore, delete it, copy the tutorial version over, and make that one the new \"your version\" and proceed on with trying to do it your own way. And of course, keep updating your notes as you go, revising and updating and reviewing the documentation as needed. If an existing concept is added to, update it. If new concepts are introduced, add them. Once this new tutorial is done, repeat the third and fourth steps, but with the twist of trying to make a full project that combines both the stuff you learned from previous tutorial(s) and this new tutorial.",

I have been applying like crazy and finally got an interview with a company, and I thought that “Finally, I might land this job as I cleared 4 rounds”. But bro, this one totally broke me.\n\nHere’s how it went:\n\n1. **HR call** – pretty standard.\n2. **Online assessment** – did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions\n3. **Home Assignment** – spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).\n4. **Follow-up Round** –  1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.\n5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** – I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a \"have a nice day\" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.\n\nNo idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.\n\nI am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. 😭😭😭😫\n\nAnyway, just needed a place to vent this out.\n\nThanks for reading. Back to the grind 😒",

I have so many questions...\n\nI live in South America and while some things are similar compared to U.S, I've never seen in my life someone with 2 YOE doing the equivalent of $18,000 a month. That’s the kind of salary you might earn at the end of your career *if* you're extremely skilled.\n\nIs that the average TC for developers with 2 YOE or this is just at FAANGs?\n\nHow hard it is to get this kind of job in U.S? We know the market is terrible right now (and not only in U.S) but when I see this kind of posts, I question whether that's true. The market is terrible or the market is terrible for new-grads?\n\nFor context: we have FAANGs here too, but you would never make that amount of money with 2 YOE and the salary is way lower than $18,000 per month for absolutely any kind of developer role.\n\nEdit: unbeliavable\\*. Thanks for all replies!",

Because I wanted to move up. \n\nNow, I find myself working hard and I stop short and think to myself, what's the point? Last time I did that, what did it result in? I got lots of accolades, denied for a raise because it just wasn't in the budget even though we had record profits, meets expectations and not exceptional or above average. Just got given an average rating because of the stacked ranking is basically designed so you can never be exceeds expectations....\n\n\nAnd the worst part is that you will get laid off at any time for literally no reason other than, the shareholders need more money, or the executives need a little bit extra for themselves. So like, what's the point of working hard anymore?\n\n\n**Here's a typical scenario, the one my co-worker experienced last year at Microsoft:**\n\nWorking at Microsoft, work his ass off every single day of his life, glued to his computer like a literal servant. Login early, skip lunch, stay late to help people out and be a \" team player \". Commended and received plenty of accolades, recognition, got an award. Recently got laid off, even though he was told several times that his program that he was a part of was absolutely essential, like one of the most important things in the company. Working on co-pilot and other AI tools that would be making millions of dollars. All of his hard work, working himself to the point of near exhaustion, he was rewarded with unemployment.

These AI agents would not just automate coding, but also perform broader tasks like negotiations and decision-making—mostly for other AI agents.\n\nHe aims to deploy the **first billion AI agents by the end of 2025**, with **trillions more to follow**, suggesting a sweeping automation of roles traditionally handled by humans. No detailed timeline has been provided.\n\nThe announcement has implications beyond just software engineering, but it could especially impact how the tech industry views the future of programming careers.",

I’ll just throw in my own opinion on hiring. \n\nIf you’re a talented and hardworking person who loves CS, stay hopeful. \n\nAt big tech it is well understood that AI is a tool and the true magic comes from person + machine. Remember that software is written for people using a human readable language. It will forever serve humans and will require human operators. AI will never fully replace you.\n\nExperienced folks also tend to lose motivation and become bitter over time. New grads will always deliver a wave of fresh energy and competition. With a good blend of naïveté and starry eyed optimism, you’re a hot commodity. Like a vampire, company needs annual new blood to keep innovating. FANG will always have new grad hiring programs. \n\nLastly, this is still a golden age for software. The responsibility for a software engineer would evolve to take on more breadth. CEOs won’t suddenly add “prompting software to do shit” on their schedules.  It will still be you bringing that software to life.\n\nIf you love the field, love the course work, you should still be very excited about the prospects of this career. \n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a backend engineer at a (well funded) startup, helped out with the interview process recently. We wanted to fill these 3 roles: backend, devops, and data engineering. I was surprised at how quickly we were able to wrap it up.\n\nCouple of observations:\n\n__You're actually pretty cooked if you don't have networking skills.__\n\nWe received 500+ applications across all the 3 roles in just one week, which seemed crazy for a seed stage startup in a niche industry. Even after filtering them for (a) location (given lots of people from abroad or other cities were yolo applying) (b) relevant experience (have they worked with the same stack before?) and (c) school (least weight but obviously relevant), we had about \\~50 quality candidates, or about \\~15 for each role. Quick 30 min intro + technical verbal call with them filtered down the pool to \\~5 per role. We then did more in-depth technical interviews.\n\nFunnily enough, out of the 3 that ended up getting hired, 2 were recommended internally by other coworkers (we have a referral bonus to incentivize them + wanted to hire people who have previously worked with someone on the team who can vouch for their skills) and 1 was hired because they cold DM'd the CEO on twitter (with a surprisingly comprehensive memo on how they'd improve our platform and their relevant experience). \n\nSo yeah, 500+ applications only to hire people we already kinda knew.\n\n_If you're getting into CS_: Attend hackathons/conferences, network aggressively during your internships, contribute to popular open-source projects if only to expand your connections, stay in touch with people from your school and former colleagues, hit up your network to reach out if they've a role you'd be a fit for, take initiative and cold DM people. Whatever it takes to build your network and get your foot through the door.\n\n__AI slop has fried the brains of a lot of new grads.__\n\nLook, I like cursor/claude code as much as anybody else and have no shame in admitting it has boosted my productivity a ton. \n\nBut interviewing people has made me _very_ glad I graduated before LLMs took off.\n\nThis is because a lot of candidates were either (a) blatantly cheating during the interview using some sort of AI tool (could tell from their eye movement and/or how they arrived at the correct answer but couldn't justify how they got there at all) OR (b) didn't have the intuition you'd expect from a software engineer who has spent years coding by throwing stuff at the wall and looking things up (\"learning how to learn\").\n\nI'm personally starting to think AI is a net negative for new grads in that it both nerfs your reasoning muscles (unless u know how to use it properly, i.e as a resource to speed up your learning process wrt core concepts, instead of a black box u mindlessly copy + paste from) AND also forces employers to put higher weight on credentialism (prestige of your school/internships/full time jobs/networking) given the rampant amount of cheating it enables during a remote technical interview.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if in-person interviews became the norm again, which is unfortunate because that would reduce the amount of economic mobility available to someone w/o much experience who say went to a no name school and lives in the middle of nowhere.\n\nGood luck!",

        "author": "Yung_Carrot",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*\n\nI always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)\n\nI do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.\n\nAs for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.\n\nI did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.\n\nThe first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.\n\nFor context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nOf course, this is just one data point. YMMV\n\nTo those still hunting, good luck.",

I’m the most recent dev to join the team.\n\nAt the beginning, I noticed people didn’t offer opinions when the lead dev spoke, and I assumed it was fear. This guy curses during dev meetings when he sees weird stuff (usually some weird requirement from product), so I thought everyone was just intimidated.\n\nBut as time went on, I realized the lead dev isn’t an ogre, he just lacks social skills. And honestly, I think there’s a lack of trust in the contractors. These guys, they do the bare minimum. Clean code practices is like an alien concept. Magic numbers in conditionals, functions scattered all over the place, no deletion of unused code, functions names not describing what they do. It’s a mess. Something that should take a day takes three, just because you have to go through the messy code or refactor first, which I think it’s only me who does it anyways.\n\nI’ve mentioned my concerns like the usage of magic numbers and only the lead dev reacts. The rest stay silent. They rarely answer questions unless I tag them in the message. It feels like they’re just taking advantage of the fact that the lead dev is a workaholic who works weekends and oversees everything. I get just doing your job and collecting paychecks, but I can’t understand this level of laziness. It’s crazy.\n\nI want to push more for clean code practices, but I don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation for anybody, specially if things seem to be working out they way things are now. The lead dev does care, but he’s got too much on his plate and is focused on shipping. He’s the only one reviewing PRs, I understand why he may let things slide. If I’m going to start reviewing PRs and putting more time into raising the quality bar, I want to make sure management sees it.\n\nOn one hand, I’d love to just keep things chill and cash my check. On the other, it’s frustrating working in this mess and seeing the laziness. Not sure how to move forward. Anyone been in a similar spot?",

There’s such a strong feeling everything will be taken over by AI but at the same time I feel like my team members aren’t very strong technically where we can even properly identify best practices without AI that I feel AI isn’t going to make that process any better.\n\nHas anybody else faced these issues?

I have a job that pays $20 an hour, and my life is pretty shitty overall. I’m considering law school to get me out of this situation that I’ve put myself in. I was very motivated to learn for a while, but I keep going through life circumstances that are killing my motivation. I honestly feel lost and don’t know where to start at the moment. I don’t know what the path is to a job. I’ve sent out a thousand applications and only got one OA through networking. I did pretty poorly. I lost my motivation to leetcode since I haven’t had one interview since I began leetcoding during my sophomore year. That part is my fault. Had I kept leetcoding, I might have landed that job. I’m not sure if I’m asking for advice or just ranting, but I genuinely don’t know what to do. My parents are aging and need to retire soon but gave up all their savings in the process of getting us to America to escape the war back home. Up until we came to the US, I was the smartest kid in school. Always at the top of my class and expected to do great things. Now I’m laying in bed while my brother screams while playing Valorant. My room is dirty, and I have no motivation to do anything. My job is mentally draining and I get screamed at daily. I can sense my parents’ disappointment every time I talk to them. Is there any way out? If I wanted to get myself out of this situation and gave 100% effort, where should I start? ",

I have been working extremely hard grinding leetcode, focusing on personal projects, and practicing interviews. I applied to at least 500 jobs and only got called for an interview from 6. Even when my interviews went well, there was always someone better in their eyes. I went to college in a different part of the country, so I don't really have access to those resources anymore. \n\nWorst part is how recruiters react when they hear I've been unemployed for 7 months: they either scoff and outright ghost. These all have been taking an extreme toll on my mental health. I've had a few resume reviews 4-5 months ago and all I got were \"it's not you but the current market or \"your profile is extremely strong, keep applying\" but it's only gone downhill from there. I had 4 internships at prestigious companies and all ended with excellent final reports but no return offers due to budget cuts. \n\nI'm sending cold messages on LinkedIn constantly but no one responds anymore. All my friends have started ghosting me as well so I can't ask for referrals from them. I can't express how depressed I've been watching all of my peers working at FAANG while I'll be happy to just take any SWE/ML job. I'm happy for them but also upset as I have no idea how to get help. \n\nThe last call I got from a recruiter, she outright asked me why I don't have a job yet in an extremely condescending manner although that requisition was for someone who graduated within the last year.\nI'm also a US citizen, so I don't think immigration/visa issues are relevant.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has tips on expanding my network, getting referrals, or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nTldr; 7 months since graduation and no prospects of new grad roles. Losing all hopes and mental health is in the gutter. Would appreciate advice on building network or anything that'll get me out of this deep pit. ",

He estimates it would take at the very minimum one year, most likely two years, to get the AI tools capable of even helping us efficiently. Not even to take over our code protection. However, he gave us advice that we should present ourselves as AI experts right now. He said we could do that by  learning how to use the AI tools to take over small tasks as much possible and teaching others to do the same.\n\nSo the question is, where do I go from here? Based on these estimates, I could stay at that FAANG company for a few more years and then job hop to a company that hasn’t migrated to AI software. \n\nBut I also want job security- well the little that is possible in this field. It seems like being a SWE isn’t sustainable long term with the AI migration. Should I start researching other jobs in tech to pivot to? Are there any indications of what that move should be or is it too early to tell?",

A little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in CS and I graduated in 2021. I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now.  I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.\n\nI was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.\n\nWhere do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry? Trying to decide between focusing on statistics/data analysis using Python, PowerBI, Tableau, etc versus learning full-stack development with Java as backend and Javascript for front-end?

I'm grateful for the opportunity I have, but I’m trying to plan out my next steps so I can move in the direction I actually want. From what I've heard, there are no pivot opportunities into dev teams internally as those teams are now offshore. \n\nCoincidentally, I am also starting an online, part-time CS masters degree in the Fall.

I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD.  \nI am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years.  \nI love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education.  \nHowever, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities.  \nThe reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.\n\nSo I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.\n\nTL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job. Is it worth perusing a bachelors degree in CS?",

During the review, manager cited poor market as I thought he would. I held my position that market does not dictate my salary, my own performance and output does. I also explained that my previous company I'd been with for many years had still given me raises during the recession 2007-09 because \"its a hard time not just for us, but also for you, and we want our people to know they will be rewarded for good performance and hard work\".

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Going to graduate with BS in CS soon from a no name university. I have developed a love for CS theory, specifically in anything related to reducing latency and increasing throughput. For example, distributed systems, compilers, parallel computing, high-performance computing, DSA, core OS, DB internals, CPU architecture.\n\nI'm going to be working at Meta as a SWE. Even though I'm joining at E3, I have heard many horror stories of the WLB at Meta so I already have the expectation that I will be working 50 hours per week. Hell, I have seen posts on here that might be exaggerating, but people are claiming to be working 60+ hours per week at Meta. I haven't been team matched yet since they're doing bootcamp this year for E3.\n\nWith that being said, I have done some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations and I believe if I pursue a Master's part-time, I will only have 15 hours left in my week in total for leisure (e.g. girlfriend, gym, hobbies unrelated to CS). Also, this might put a strain on my performance at work and promo speed, which is very important to me. Moreover, if I focus on work and promo speed, depending on what team I am on I am thinking since I'm in big tech where scale matters, I might already be learning about distributed systems, compilers, and the rest of my interests on the job itself without having to do a Master's. I would lose the actual credential of a Master's degree but I would probably (hopefully) have more impact, greater performance and bonus, less risk of layoff, faster promo speed, etc. at work to offset this. Furthermore, I would use 3-4 years of my early/mid 20s on further schooling, but I'm also not the type to want to party hard all night long or something like that.\n\nHowever, I also see some benefits. For one, I will only pay a total of like $2000 for the entire Master's program. Meta will cover the rest. It's GaTech's OMSCS. Additionally, when I am older, I think it might be fun to become a sessional instructor at my undergrad, which requires a grad degree. I also did some research in undergrad, and I feel like doing a Master's program might potentially open up more opportunities for research in the future. On that note, I'm also interested in the opportunity that this might open up to move into quant dev (not quant trader, researcher, analyst, or any of the \"true quant roles\"). My areas of interest are related to quant dev I believe, and I personally find finance very interesting so I think it might be a good fit. But I also don't think that GaTech OMSCS is a target program for quant firms, so regardless of whether I pursue this or not that door might just be closed.\n\nTL;DR: should I do Master's if I already have big tech full-time job lined up? Cons is mostly time commitment which might strain work performance. Pros are potential opportunities a Master's might open and I would genuinely be interested in the content, or at least I loved studying CS in undergrad.",

Second gap is due to a layoff, but I was really doing well at that job. This one seems to be a downturn in the company as well. I was doing fine at job based on ratings.\n\nI just don't know how to overcome to bias that seems to come with this. I can not lie on my application about timelines, because every job I have taken asks for a background check. Sure, I found my current job with 2 gaps on application, but I don't know about three.\n\nI don't care about the gaps financially, I have savings to last for it. But there does seem to be some bias against this. I know I was pressed by one recruiter who specifically treated me like I was hiding something due to the gaps. As if I was a poor performer who kept losing his job. I also sometimes wonder if that is why I wasn't getting some responses back on jobs. Only reason I have my current job is mainly because of a connection I had.\n\nSo, how do I handle this? What can I do to prevent his being an issue?\n\nThe job market is horrible right now, even for an experienced dev like me. I have thrown a few applications out there and usually would at least get a recruiter calling me, nothing. There is nothing wrong with my application. I've already had it reviewed and it worked fine in my last job search (that was even without a job at the time. I still have my job right now). Granted, I only did a few to test the waters though.
