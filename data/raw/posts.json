        "content": "We are hiring for a data engineering position, and I am responsible for the technical portion of the screening process. \n\nIt‚Äôs pretty basic verbal stuff, explain the different sql joins, explain CTEs, explain Python function vs generator, followed by some very easy functional programming in python and some spark. \n\nAnyway ‚Äî back to my story. \n\nI hop onto the meeting and introduce myself and ask some warm up questions about their background, etc. Immediately I notice this person‚Äôs head moves a LOT when they talk. And it moves in this‚Ä¶ odd kind of way‚Ä¶ and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this‚Ä¶  agent‚Ä¶. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. \n\nThen we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It‚Äôs a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn‚Äôt even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. \n\nSo I ask ‚Äúinteresting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?‚Äù And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. \n\n\nSo I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone‚Äôs scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. \n\nThis is the world we are living in. \n\nThis is not an advertisement for a position, please don‚Äôt ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews. If you contact me about this position, I promise I will just delete the message. Sorry. \n\n\nI very much wish I could have interviewed a real person instead of wasting 30 minutes of my time üòî \n",

We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.\n\nIt's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly. I want to build things that are scalable, maintainable, and accurate. But I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle and I'm starting to burn out from caring too much when no one else seems to.\n\nIf you've ever been in a situation like this, how did you handle it? How do you keep your mental health intact when you're the only one pushing for quality? Did you stay and try to change things over time or did you eventually leave?\n\nAny advice, even small things, would help.\n\nPS: I'm not a manager - just a humble analyst üòÖ\n\n",

        "content": "Hi !\n\nI know this isn't a UI subreddit, but wanted to share something here.\n\nI've been working in the data space for the past 7 years and have been extremely frustrated by the lack of good UI/UX. lots of stuff is purely programatic, super static, slow, etc. Probably some of the worst UI suites out there.\n\nI've been working on an interface to work with data interactively, with as little latency as possible. To make it ***feel*** instant.\n\nWe accidentally built an insanely fast rendering mechanism for large tables. I found it to be so fast that I was curious to see how much I could throw at it...\n\nSo I shoved in 100 million rows (and 16 columns) of test data...\n\nThe results... well... even surprised me...\n\n[100 million rows preview](https://reddit.com/link/1lb13ep/video/yeivgrn7wt6f1/player)\n\n*This is a development build, which is not available yet, but wanted show here first...*\n\nOnce the data loaded (which did take some time) the scrolling performance was buttery smooth. My MacBook's display is 120hz and you cannot feel any slowdown. No lag, super smooth scrolling, and instant calculations if you add a custom column.\n\nFor those curious, the main thread latency for operations like deleting a column, or reordering were between **120¬µs-300¬µs**. So that means you hit the keyboard, and it's done. No waiting. Of course this is not for *every* operation, but for the common ones, it's extremely fast.\n\nGetting results for custom columns were **<30ms**, no matter where you were in the table. Any latency you see via ### is just a UI choice we made but will probably change it (it's kinda ugly).\n\n  \n***How did we do this?***\n\nThis technique uses a combination of lazy loading, minimal memory copying, value caching, and GPU accelerated rendering of the cells. Plus some very special sauce I frankly don't want to share ;) To be clear, **this was not easy.**\n\nWe also set out to ensure that we hit a roundtrip time of <33ms UI updates per distinct user action (other than scrolling). This is the threshold for feeling instant.\n\nWe explicitly avoided the use of Javascript and other web technologies, because frankly they're entirely incapable of performance like this.\n\n***Could we do more?***\n\n*Actually, yes.* I have some ideas to make the initial load time even faster, but still experimenting. \n\n  \n***Okay, but is looking at 100 million rows actually useful?***\n\nFor a 100 million rows, honestly, probably not. But who knows ? I know that for smaller datasets, in 10s of millions, I've wanted the ability to look through all the rows to copy certain values, etc.\n\nIn this case, it's kind of just a side-effect of a really well-built rendering architecture ;)\n\nIf you wanted, and you had a really beefy computer, I'm sure you could do 500 million or more with the same performance. Maybe we'll do that someday (?)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you think. I was thinking about making a more technical write up for those curious...",

Torn between safety and opportunity.\n\nBackground:\nI‚Äôm 28 and have spent the last 7 years working primarily as a Cloud Data Engineer (most recently in a Lead role), with some Solutions Engineering work on the side.

I‚Äôd need to learn it from the ground up\n\n‚Ä¢ They‚Äôre willing to fully support my ramp-up\n\n‚Ä¢ 2‚Äì3 year commitment expected\n\n‚Ä¢ Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning before\n\nOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client\n\n‚Ä¢ Work involves building a data platform on GCP\n\n‚Ä¢ Very much in my comfort zone; I‚Äôve done this kind of work for years\n\n‚Ä¢ Slight pay bump\n\n‚Ä¢ Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant‚Äîlow learning, low risk\n\nWhat‚Äôs tearing me up:\n\n‚Ä¢ The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader\n\n‚Ä¢ My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands\n\n‚Ä¢ But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience‚Äîam I killing my momentum?\n\n‚Ä¢ What if the startup fails? Will a 2‚Äì3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?\n\n‚Ä¢ The safe choice is obvious‚Äîbut the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experience\n\nPersonal context:\n\n‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt have major financial obligations right now‚Äîso if I ever wanted to take a risk, now‚Äôs probably the time\n\n‚Ä¢ My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I‚Äôd want to commit fully for at least a couple of years\n\nQuestions for you all:\n\n‚Ä¢ Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?\n\n‚Ä¢ If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?\n\n‚Ä¢ Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?\n\n‚Ä¢ Or am I overthinking this entirely?\n\n\nThanks for reading this long post‚Äîhonestly just needed to write it out. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's been through something like this.\n",

So I built something myself ‚Äî a **distributed review analysis pipeline** using Dask, PyTorch, and transformer-based NLP models.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* **Data:** 17M+ Steam reviews (\\~40GB uncompressed), scraped using the Steam API\n* **Hardware:** Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB RAM, RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)\n* **Goal:** Process massive review datasets quickly and summarize key insights (sentiment + summarization)\n\n**Engineering Challenges (and Lessons):**\n\n1. **Transformer Parallelism Pain:** Initially, each Dask worker loaded its own model ‚Äî ballooned memory use 6x. Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.\n2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.\n3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and:\n   * Spawns optimal number of workers\n   * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM\n   * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU\n4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes ‚Äî now it's down to \\~2 minutes. 15x speedup.\n\n**Dask Architecture Highlights:**\n\n* Dynamic worker spawning\n* Shared model access\n* Fault-tolerant processing\n* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks\n\n**What I‚Äôd Love Advice On:**\n\n* Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?\n* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?\n* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?\n* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?\n* Are there common pitfalls I‚Äôm not seeing?\n\n**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:**\n\n* App Store reviews\n* Amazon product sentiment\n* Customer feedback for SaaS tools\n\nüîó **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)\n\nI've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it\n\n  \nHappy to take any suggestions ‚Äî would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!\n\nThanks in advance üôè",

I don‚Äôt have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I‚Äôm the one with the most experience in Python. \n\nWe had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute. Previously I had about 25 scripts that would launch at different times to my worker on our company server using prefect. It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. \n\nI liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don‚Äôt really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I‚Äôve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt know how to have something ‚Äòtalk‚Äô to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. \n\nI could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup. My boss would also like to be able to see the ‚Äòfailures‚Äô if any happen. \n\nWe have things like bitbucket/s3/snowflake that we use to host code/data/files but basically always pull them down to our local/ inside Alteryx.  \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated and I‚Äôm sorry for any incorrect terminology/lack of understanding.

        "author": "godz_ares",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\n[https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase](https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase)\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any feedback and any recommendations to improve my code. I was especially wondering whether a DuckDB database was the right way to go.  I am still learning and developing my understanding of ETL concepts. There's an explanation below but feel free to ignore if you don't want to read too much. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMy project's goal is to allow rock climbers to better plan their outdoor climbing sessions based on which locations have the best weather (e.g. no precipitation, not too cold etc.).\n\nCurrently I have the ETL pipeline sorted out.\n\nThe rock climbing location Dataframe contains data such as the name of the location, the name of the routes, the difficulty of the routes as well as the safety grade where relevant. It also contains the type of rock (if known) and the type of climb.\n\nThis data was scraped by a Redditor I met called u/AmbitiousTie, who gave a helping hand by scraping UKC, a very famous rock climbing website. I can't claim credit for this. \n\nI wrote some code to normalize and clean the Dataframe. Some changes I made was dropping some columns, changing the datatypes, removing nulls etc. Each row pertains to a singular route. With over 120,000 rows of data.\n\nI used the longitude and latitude of my climbing Dataframe as an argument for my Weather API call. I used OpenMeteo free tier API as it is extremely generous. Currently, the code only fetches weather data for only 50 climbing locations. But when the API is called without this limitation it has over 710,000 rows of data. While this does take a long time but I can use pagination on my endpoint to only call the weather data for the locations that is currently being seeing by the user at a single time..\n\nI used Great-Expectations to validate both Dataframe at both a schema, row and column level.  \n\nI loaded both Dataframe into an in-memory DuckDB database, following the schema seen below (but without the dimDateTime table). Credit to u/No-Adhesiveness-6921 for recommending this schema. I used DuckDB because it was the easiest to use - I tried setting up a PostgreSQL database but ended up with errors and got frustrated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkb85ebk7y6f1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f13454a40df069957a5aaec7b2df111830c316\n\nI used Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. The pipeline is run every day at 1AM to ensure the weather data is up to data. Currently the DAG involves one instance which encapsulates the entire ETL pipeline. However, I plan to modularize my DAGs in the future. I am just finding it hard to find a way to process Dataframe from one instance to another.\n\nDocker was used for virtualisation to get the Airflow to run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rpquq7c8y6f1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3720d0188006c25aabbf9931956bb63cf98637\n\nI also used pytest for both unit testing and features testing.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI am planning on increasing the size of my climbing data. Maybe all the climbing locations in Europe, then the world. This will probably require Spark and some threading as well. \n\nI also want to create an endpoint and I am planning on learning FastAPI to do this but others have recommended Flask or Django\n\n**Challenges:**\n\nDocker - Docker is a pain in the ass to setup and is as close to black magic as I have come in my short coding journey.\n\nGreat Expectations - I do not like this package. While flexible and having a great library of expectations, is is extremely cumbersome. I have to add expectations to a suite one by one. This will be a bottleneck in the future for sure. Also getting your data setup to be validated is convoluted. It also didn't play well with Airflow. I couldn't get the validation operator to work due to an import error. I also couldn't get data docs to work either. As a result I had to integrate validations directly into my ETL code and the user is forced to scour the .json file to find why a certain validation failed. I am actively searching for a replacement.",

Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?\n\nOff the top of my head the solutions I've read are:\n\n1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)\n\n2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a \"master\" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.\n\n3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department \"Shops\" - there is no department \"Shops\", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that \"Shops\" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.\n\n4. force child systems to at least incorporate the \"owning\" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.\n\nAre there other design patterns I'm missing?",

I'm considering using bigquery to store the data since its free tier seems like a good fit. For reporting, I'm planning to use looker studio, as again, it has a free tier.\n\nHowever, I'm still unsure about the orchestration part. I'd like to run ETL pipelines on a weekly basis. Ideally, I'd use Airflow or Dagster, but I haven‚Äôt found a free or low-cost way to host them.\n\nAre there any platforms that let you run a small instance of Airflow or Dagster for free (or really cheap)? Or are there other lightweight tools you'd recommend for scheduling and orchestrating jobs in a setup like this?\n\nThanks for any help! ",

Most of our data is similar to a time-series so we thought of going with another Postgres instance but with Timescale installed to create aggregate functions. We mainly need to keep sums / averages / of historical data and timescale seems like a good fit for this.\n\nThe problem I have is how can I keep RDS -> Postgres in sync? Our use-case cannot really have batched data because our services need this analytics data to perform domain decisions (has a user reached his daily transactions limit for example) and we also want to offload all of our grafana dashboards from the main database to Timescale.\n\nWhat do people usually use for this? Debezium? Logical Replication? Any other tool?\n\nWe would really like to keep using RDS as a source of truth but offload all analytics to another DB that is more suited for this, if possible.\n\nIf so, how do you deal with an evolving DDL schema over time, do you just apply your DB migrations to both DBs and call it a day? Do you keep a completely different schema for the second database?\n\nOur Timescale instance would be hosted in K8s through the CNPG operator.\n\nI want to add that we are not 100% set on Timescale and would be open to other suggestions. We also looked at Starrocks, a CNCF project, which looks promising but a bit complex to get up and running.",

But not just one, as there are subsets of tasks that do not depend on any other subsets of tasks. So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).\n\nI work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.\n\n1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.\n\n2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.\n\n3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.\n\n4. Create \"dummy tasks\" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.\n\n5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.\n\n6. Dynamically start tasks based on the current workload. This would add extra maintenance, manual dependency processing.\n\nDo you have any better solutions?\n",

I am dealing with a request to create a table that tracks various entities that are marked as duplicate by business (this table is created manually as it requires very specific \"gut feel\" business knowledge. And this table will be read by business only to make decisions, it should \\*not\\* feed into some entity resolution pipeline).\n\nI wonder what fields should be in a table like this? I was thinking something like:\n\n\\- important entity info (e.g. name, address, colour... for example)\n\n\\- some 'group id', where entities that have the same group id are in fact the same entity. \n\nAnything else? maybe identifying the canonical entity?\n\n",

My German level is B2 in listening and reading, and about B1 in speaking. I‚Äôm a non-EU Master's student in Germany with about one year left until graduation.\n\nMy goal is to build solid proficiency in both the tech stack and the German language over the next year, and then begin applying for jobs. I have no professional experience yet.\n\nBut to be honest‚ÄîI've been pushing myself really hard for the past few years, and I‚Äôm now at the edge of burnout. Recently, I've seen many Reddit posts saying the junior job market is brutal, the IT sector is struggling, and there's a looming threat from AI automation.\n\nI feel lost and mentally exhausted. I'm not sure if all this effort will pay off, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just enjoy my remaining time in the EU and then head back home.\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is there still a realistic chance for someone like me (zero experience, but good German skills and strong tech learning) to break into the German job market‚Äîespecially in Data Engineering, Cloud Engineering, or even DevOps (I know DevOps is usually a mid-senior role, but still curious)?\n\n\n2. Do you think the job market for Data Engineers in Germany will improve in the next 1‚Äì2 years? Or is it becoming oversaturated?\n\n\nI‚Äôd really appreciate any honest thoughts or advice. Thanks again for reading.\n",

We were rewriting the same queries, juggling multiple tools, and losing past work and context in Slack threads.\n\nSo, I built **ToolFront**: a local, open-source server that acts as a unified interface for AI assistants to query all your databases at once. It's designed to solve a few key problems:\n\n* Useful queries get written once, then lost forever in DMs or personal notes.\n* Constantly re-configuring database connections for different AI tools is a pain.\n* Most multi-database solutions are cloud-based, meaning your schema or data goes to a third party (no thanks).\n\nHere‚Äôs what it does:\n\n* Unifies all your databases with a one-step setup. Connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc., and configure clients like Cursor and Copilot in a single step.\n* It runs locally on your machine, never exposes credentials, and enforces read-only operations by design.\n* Teaches the AI with your team's proven query patterns. Instead of just seeing a raw schema, the AI learns from successful, historical queries to understand your data's context and relationships.\n\nWe're in **open beta** and looking for people to try it out, break it, and tell us what's missing. All features are completely free while we gather feedback.\n\nIt's open-source, and you can find instructions to run it with Docker or install it via pip/uv on the GitHub page.\n\nIf you're dealing with similar workflow pains, I'd love to get your thoughts!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)",

I began with BASIC and assembler on a C64, then I started working professionally with C/C++ then Visual Basic, Lotus Notes, .NET, C#, Java/Spring and now it's mostly JS, Node and React.\n\nI've never been attached to any particular language/technique but looked at what different platforms can offer. It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.\n\nSomething that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.\nBack in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where \"script kiddies\" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later.\n \nSo on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.\n\nEspecially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.\n\nI get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the \"don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts \"like I'm five\". It's a  private tutor that never gets tired of your silly questions.\n\nJust my 5c",

Last year during my algorithm classes, I was able to write code myself (in C) and do well in oop(sadly it was taught in python so they didn't teach us much besides classes and basic stuff). The problem began when we were tasked of building an rpg game using a library we didn't know (pygame) in about a month. So I used AI a lot and since then I had been using Ai to code most of my stuff (even my personal projects). The problem began when we had a course where we had to build a full stack app in c# and angular. I made most of the project with Ai again, and was able to understand and explain it quite well. But when it came to do it myself, I found myself lost and didn't know what I should start by doing. I could only code when the steps were told to me clearly. \n\nSo my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning? I actually do enjoy creating stuff and I enjoy coding when I know what to do. I really want to work in this field (development in general) and I don't want to be incompetent when I have my bachelor's. Any advice? ",

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello!  \nWhen I started to learn programming a few years ago, I was introduced to OOP and I thought \"Woah, that's the best way to reason about data in programming!\". Over my experience as a programmer, I saw OOP to be highly encouraged in academy and to some degree even to my workplace.  \nAs I programmed more and more I started to hit tons of roadblocks that kept me from truly finishing my projects (mostly related to game development). It wasn't until I tried data oriented paradigms, such as an entity component system (ECS) that I saw better progress.  \nWith OOP, you have to plan very carefully how you plan your inheritance chain. You might initially make Player and Enemy inherit from Character but then decide that Player and Enemy share many things that you eventually make Player inherit from Enemy too. Then you also realize that Enemy should have a behavior you don't want Player to have. No matter what you do, you either load unused behaviors into the object or you are forced to rewrite the same code for two classes.  \nYour object can't be two things at one. Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ? Or FigherAndMageAndArcher. Code gets ugly real fast.  \nEncapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.  \nWith ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\". An \"object\" is a collection of components (position, volume...) and a system is a function that operates on objects that have certain components. With this, adding new behaviors becomes easy plug and play, as adding or removing logic doesn't break the entire program.  \nIf I were to compare this to a real life application, OOP is like building a computer in one single circuit board - something breaks, the whole computer breaks. With ECS (or DOD similar paradigms) it's like building a computer from multile parts - if an SSD fails the rest of the computer keeps working. And refactoring or modifying an OOP class is very risky, especially if that happens to a parent class, beacuse there's no way how the children will react to those changes.  \nOOP through composition is an alternative to inheritance and cleaner in my view but there's still some issues a pure DOD paradigm doesn't have. For instance, a composed class Button that is made of class Position and class Volume needs the method \"pressed()\" which in fact will act on those two inner classes. But if you change the Volume and Position, it could break again, and what if you wanted to share \"pressed()\" to another class like \"CheckBox\" ? Will you inherit from \"Button\"? It's possible but that causes lots of chains to follow that at some point becomes exhausting to keep track of. With an ECS paradigm for example the entities are self explanatory - it has that component then it's subjected to this action.  \nI find OOP has use for creating data models or classes with unique behaviors no other class has. Or use composition to build bigger classes from smaller classes.  \nHow do you view this?",

It felt like I'd never written that code at all.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? How do you remember or internalize the logic of a program beyond just writing it once?

I felt proud.\n\n, but nothing stays still so I wanted to improve more, but here it hit me I didn't have a goal nothing to look for not only in python, but in programming as a whole and didn't that only not make me know what to focus on, but also now I stopped feeling enthusiastic whenever somebody starts to say learn x I just feel ...tired exhausted and the worst part is that I like writing code I just have no goal no big grand goal.\n\nAnd keep in mind when I started to try to get better at python I chose to choose another language and kept bouncing between languages so that made my progress decrease a lot and probably was one of the biggest reasons is why I don't want to learn its because I just want to code.\n\nI am just here to whine if you want to help somehow do so I won't stop you and thanks, but I just did this because no one in my family could understand what I am saying so I decided to say it to people who will understand what I am talking about.\n\nif you have passed through this please help\n\nthanks for hearing me ramble for this long.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nHello,\n\nI wanted to end this on a happy note so here we are\n\nI just finished my first real project\n\nits a todo list cli tool a proper cli tool made in python you could install it by following the instructions in the repo, sadly its only available on Linux and also don't expect much its just a normal todo list just for me to learn through it json, and making a proper project etc\n\nI would be very happy if anybody installed it but no pressure\n\nhere is the link\n\n[https://github.com/Omar-Arabi1/Todo\\_list\\_cli\\_tool?tab=readme-ov-file#](https://github.com/Omar-Arabi1/Todo_list_cli_tool?tab=readme-ov-file#)\n\nso yeah I found my way in the end and thanks to all of you for commenting or even caring and a big thanks to who installed the program\n\nsee you later",

I do not care; I just want a smooth implementation of my ideas.\n\nI am currently using a Linux VM on my windows pc to learn. I like the simplicity of it, the separation from my main files(in some manner) and all the bash stuff. I have two monitors. One I dedicate to the tutorials(windows side, because the VM runs videos and other things slowly) and the other I dedicate to all my practice and coding and all that. This has worked well for me so far, but I would like to know if this will cause me issues in the future.\n\nAll my writing files for this project are in google docs or libreoffice, the former because I tend to write on a laptop away from home and need a way to keep it synced. Most of my non-coding development for this project happens on windows, as well as other things like browsing or playing games. \n\nMy question is this: should I plan to scoot over to Linux permanently at some point? Should I dual boot? Should I plan to transfer my knowledge to Windows after this course is finished(Odin project, of course)? Should I dual boot? \n\nIf the answer to these are ‚Äúpersonal preference‚Äù I am completely okay with that. I am just seeking guidance, know the pros and cons for my situation, and I do not need Linux for the purpose of being marketable for companies(which is what people mention whenever this question comes up online, for good reason.)",

        "content": "I understand that documentation pretty much has everything you could ever want to know about a certain technology, but I personally HATE learning through documentation.\n\nI never understood the advice of, \"just read the documentation\",  SPECIFICALLY towards beginners. Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.\n\nNow, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, \"Hey I want to learn HTML\". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.\n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, \"just dive in and read MDN when you get lost\". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.",

I have a dependancy upon these tools which i now find constrain my ability to write fresh code. \n\nAm i doing something wrong in programming? Ive been at this on and off for the past 3/4 years and i just cannot retain specific functions and libraries languages need to make some programs, and it makes me feel useless as a programmer. How could i transition from where i am currently to progress further.\n\nI have never touched programming books or any biographies, i have only previously tried to get inspiration from others code, developing off examples on libraries and writing stuff, getting to a point where i am stuck and reverting to AI, baffling my flow and resulting in lacks of motivation where i am supposed to be in control of software im writing, but it takes over and becomes another sequence of hoops i need to jump through to even get anywhere.\n\nAny feedback towards my situation would help me so much, im looking forward to spending an extended period over the summer to try to become the best i can be, an end goal trying to create a product with some revenue so i can fund a community project that ive wanted to do for a while. \n\nThanks for reading",

        "content": "In high school (grades 9‚Äì11), I was the best student in my class at math. I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.\n\nNow I‚Äôm studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.\n\nOf course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.\n\nTo create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.\n\nHowever, here‚Äôs my problem:  \n\nI struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don‚Äôt remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it ‚Äî which takes time.\n\nSo I‚Äôd like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics:  \n\nWhen you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?\n\nAlso, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don‚Äôt know all the higher math theory by heart? What if I can't solve a math problem on the spot?\n\nLastly, I‚Äôm worried that in real work I‚Äôll spend too much time solving math problems, which might not be acceptable for employers. ",

I'm here to ask for some tips and advices for both personal and carrier growth. \n\nSome years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it.  I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware,  and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. \n\nSo, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). \n\nBut in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. \n\nNow, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.\n\nThat said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:\n\n1)where should I start?\n2)what should I prioritize? \n3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.\n\nI know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now. The moment in your life when you realize you know enough to be where you are, but not enough to go much further. \n\nThanks for your time ",

        "content": "First of all I'll give some context:\n\nWebsite is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like \"serving\" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).\n\nFast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)\n\nSo what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:\n1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since \"AI slop\")\n2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.\n\nFirst approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thing\n\nWhich one do you think I should work on? And if there's something you'd like to add, please tell me.\n\nPS: I'm more of a machine learning kind of guy and not frontend and all",

        "content": "I‚Äôve been a programmer for most of my life. I started with PHP, which I worked with for around 10 years.\n\nEventually, I wanted to level up. I began reading more and more about design patterns and techniques like generics and other advanced concepts. When the opportunity came along, I made the switch to Go. However, I never quite got used to the syntax‚Äîit felt a bit old-school, with very short and cryptic naming conventions. After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.\n\nUnfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.\n\nSince I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn‚Äôt reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.\n\nFor the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.\n\nI started doubting if it wasn‚Äôt time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. \n\nI expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.\n\nNow more then 2 years further I‚Äôm willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.\n\nBut i don‚Äôt want to do course after course. I‚Äôm also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.\n\nThe main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I‚Äôm not ready to pick it up again.\n\nI wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job. I do want to get back into software development eventually.",

        "author": "alex_sakuta",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Modern programming languages, especially dynamic languages have a really good thing going for them which is there is a library for pretty much everything you want to do which is wrapper that makes it easy for you to do the thing without ever having to understand the core architecture of how something is happening.\n\nFor example, talking about JS env: Need servers? Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.\n\nThis makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.\n\nIn my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.\n\nNow, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nI also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.\n\nBut, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.\n\nIf I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nLike because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.\n\nOn the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.\n\nSo, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.\n\nWith this, what do you suggest:\n\n- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.\n- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.\n- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",

I really like the Psychology aspects of the UX like uk thinking about the users. Human behavior interests me especially the things that they do and why they do. I was thinking to do UX/UI focus and brush up on HTML, CSS & Javascript.

But I like the uk fixing and correcting the design. I Just don't know sometimes I just want to full send front-end but coding especially backend throws me off.\n\nI have about 6 months before I graduate. I need to figure my life out.

What if the object is too small for the buffer, or too large?\n\nI'm on this path as I'm trying to learn how to process data as it is read, such as when you need to process very large files and waiting to read the entire thing at once is infeasable, or do work on data very quickly.

In the past year or so, most of my students have been software developers, and I have really enjoyed teaching you guys. And this has meant that I have shifted to focusing primarily on Software Developers. (Just so you understand the background)  \n\n\nAnd I want to know what it is that you find most difficult working in an English-speaking environment?\n\nMy observations so far have been:  \n1. If you have to explain something technically, then generally it is ok. But if you have to explain something technical to a non-technical person, it is a bit harder.   \n2. Talking in stand-ups is generally fine, but sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every time.   \n3. Asking questions and knowing when to ask questions is difficult.   \n4. Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on.  \n5. Humour is always a problem (in my opinion, it is not just a language thing but a cultural thing)  \n6. General conversations are sometimes the hardest to follow.   \n7. Phrasal verbs (phrasal verbs are everywhere with native speakers)  \n8. Giving feedback, how direct is too direct or was I too indirect? \n\nSo... those are some of my observations. Do you have any others, anything specific? \n\nI want to be the best teacher I can be for my students. And I have been trying to learn Python just so that I have some form of understanding about what it is that you need to be able to communicate.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a 27-year-old career switcher. I have a Econ degree (2020), and spent the last 5 years in finance-related roles. I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). \n\nAt first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying \"stonks go up\". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment.  And in that there is peace. \n\nBut I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. \n\nA couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you‚Äôll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.\n\nHow the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?\n\nI've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: \n\n* **Front-end** / **Web Design** \\- S.O.L\n* **Full-stack** \\- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset\n* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up\n* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \\- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand\n* **MLE / MLOps** \\- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don‚Äôt have a stats/ML background\n* **Blockchain** \\- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch \n* **Data Science / ML** \\- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats \n\nExploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. \n\nI'm also considering a master‚Äôs to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. \n\nSo my question is this. \n\nWhat path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master‚Äôs a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking? \n\nAny advice would be mucho appreciated, thanks!",

My nephew is a very talented musician and composer (just graduated a music degree with first class honours).

(Of the various things he told me about the only two I recognised by name were Ableton and Pro Tools.)\n\nAnyway, he mentioned to me the other day that he thought it would be useful if he learned a bit of programming. Not because he wants a fallback career as a developer, but simply because he thought it might be useful to his music making. I certainly think it‚Äôs a useful skill to have.\n\nNow I have my own personal views about what are good first programming languages (Lua, Python, Javascript), and what aren‚Äôt good places to start (C, C++, Rust). But ultimately what‚Äôs most important is learning something that he can actually be productive with in his domain.\n\nTo be honest, I don‚Äôt even know what the possibilities here are. Scripting, automation, and macros? Extensions and plugins?\n\nGiven how many tools he uses, obviously no one language is going to cover all bases.

When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio.  You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist.  A lot of them have barely any applicants.  If they are desperate enough they will hire you.  Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away\n\n**2. Make sure your resume is concise.**  \nWhen I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing.  Don't dilute your resume with crap.  Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work.  Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did.  Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points.  I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on.  It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.\n\n**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise**  \nIf you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things.  Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to.  Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React.  Then do the same thing with Angular etc.\n\n**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS**  \nYou need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive.  You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work.  This is especially crucial for internships.  My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup.  Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people.  Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.\n\n**5. Just straight up fucking lie**  \nI don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response.  We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer.  But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role.  I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer.  So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product.  Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer\n\n**6.  Same as number 5**  \nThis is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid.  If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience.  Same with Java and C# etc.  The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff.  It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language.  At the end of the day you need a job\n\n**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**  \nWhen I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed.  So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release.  I didn't get this job.  The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line.  I did get this job.  You get the idea\n\n**8. Do not negotiate**  \nThere's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating.  But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market.  Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage.  Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over.  I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer\n\n**9: For students: do not waste your time**  \nSeriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can.  Grades hardly matter.  I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0.  It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job.  He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off.  Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time.  Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge\n\n**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed**  \nKeep your resume up to date with your latest experience.  Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so.  I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next.  You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",

        "content": "I joined a startup about a year ago, fresh out of grad school. I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.\n\n\nA little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be \"AI first\". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, \"Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast\".\nWe are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the \"AI way\". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.\n\nThe worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.\n\nI chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, \"Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document\".\n\nMy work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus. My passion for coding and building robust systems is fading. It feels like my actual engineering skills are being devalued in favor of someone who can just prompt an AI for a passable solution to everything.\n\nIs this what the future of tech work looks like? Are other companies operating this way?\n",

How can you plan to make major life decisions like starting a family knowing you can lose your job at any time and potentially be unemployed for months. Many people are rightfully angry about it but blaming the wrong causes. \n\nIt‚Äôs true that offshoring is caused by far lower salaries in other countries but we don‚Äôt look any deeper than that. We assume it‚Äôs a good thing because the US is a ‚Äúrich‚Äù country and assume everyone else is extremely poor and desperate. We ignore that we have a huge cost of living crisis primarily driven by our insane housing costs no where higher than in Silicon Valley. \n\nThe primary cause of our high housing costs are nationwide restrictive zoning laws that prevent the supply of housing from meeting the demand and making it extremely difficult and expensive to build anything. r/yimby has great discourse on this issue if you want to learn more. \n\nIt‚Äôs impossible for Americans to compete because we would literally be homeless if we were paid equivalent salaries in the countries they are offshoring. I also worry that it is fueling \nracist backlash against certain groups. \n",

The recruiter said that is okay, but let me know in a few hours. I asked for the weekend to think it over and said I would get back Monday. This seemed okay but said she would need the answer soon because of other candidates.\n\nTruthfully I have another final round that I am hoping to hear good news back from next week, but wanted to know if anyone had ever heard something similar about them not calling the job offer an actual job offer?",

I was brought on as a specialist using a system nobody understands and the company is actively looking to deprecate.\n\nSo he brings me in to fix shit while they get the new system ready and now he says it's time to go. To top it off, he wants me to write a length \"full health\" report before they show my ass the door which substantiates the reason for them letting me go (I have fixed 90% of his problems).\n\nWhat should I do?",

        "author": "happylogicgate",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'll be graduating university in Canada next summer (I'm a Canadian citizen) and am thinking about which offer to take.\n\nI've done internships at both companies so am already familiar with my team + general work culture. Note all numbers below are in US dollars, not Canadian dollars.\n\n**Offer 1:**\n\n* Role: New Grad SWE @ Big Tech in USA\n* Compensation: 240K TC (180K base + 60K in RSUs)\n* Location: Bay Area, fully in-person\n* Pros:\n   * Getting a big company name on my resume is good for career growth\n   * I work on large-scale distributed systems, using Rust and Golang, which is really cool\n* Cons:\n   * Higher cost of living than Canada (food + rent)\n   * It's fully in-person in the Bay Area, so I'll be away from family and friends in Canada\n   * Below average work-life balance (it's common to work until 6pm)\n   * I have to be part of an on-call rotation, and it's fairly common to get multiple alerts everyday\n   * RSUs are at a high valuation, and will only increase in value if AI continues to rapidly get better\n   * RSUs are not liquid since it's a private company\n\n**Offer 2:**\n\n* Role: Tech Lead @ Tiny Startup in Canada\n* Compensation: 240K TC (240K base + no equity)\n* Location: Canada, fully remote\n* Pros:\n   * I can live at home in Canada, free rent and healthy food (if I move out to live on my own, cost of living is cheaper)\n   * Better work-life balance, since work is remote and on-call only happens during big feature releases a few times a year\n* Cons:\n   * Company is tiny, so only person above me is the CEO, so there's very little room for long-term growth / pay raises\n   * Company is not well-known, making it harder to switch to a higher paying job in the future\n   * I work on same (good, but kinda boring) TypeScript tech stack I've been working on for years, so less career growth\n\nI'm tempted to choose the easier, less risky option of the Canadian startup.\n\nThe compensation is what I expected to be making near the end of my career, not the beginning, so maybe I shouldn't worry about career growth as much? In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.\n\n**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\n\n\\---\n\n**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put \"Software Engineer\" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not \"Tech Lead\". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.\n\n**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",

IT feels like endless chaos and bullshit. Both pentesting and DevOps have buried me under mountains of tasks and drama with devs and clients. The manual testing, red team engagements, and report writing are draining asf. My boss keeps pushing for more certifications.\n\nDon't even get me started on getting pinged at all hours because pipelines \"don't work\" - only to find out some dev forgot to do a proper build on their machine, the build failed, and they blamed the CI pipeline. Between the low pay at both companies and all this stress, I'm burned tf out.\n\nAt this point, I genuinely despise cybersecurity, software development, and even the data science BS I'm learning at university. \n\nI've got multiple offers from banks and other solution companies in both fields with way better pay, but I feel paralyzed. I don't want to screw over the companies that gave me my first opportunities at such a young age. I want to leave on good terms, but I'm stuck.\n\nHonestly not sure what to do anymore.

I don't have any FAANG experience. But the companies I have worked at are known. At least some of them. This is a bit of a rant, but I don't want to get started off wrong. How should I be applying?\n\nEdit: I posted my resume here [https://imgur.com/a/IARhhgj](https://imgur.com/a/IARhhgj)\n\nEdit: After a lot of good feedback I updated my resume. It is one page. More to the point and has less fluff: [https://imgur.com/a/lygXUN7](https://imgur.com/a/lygXUN7)\n\nEdit: I am using this for my formats: [https://latexresu.me/generator/templates](https://latexresu.me/generator/templates)\n\nEdit: Can't thank you guys enough. Got a lot of brutally honest answers (I mean this is reddit...). I now am getting the gist. \n\n1. Resume - Short, compact, with metrics and targeted for a specific role. Make a few if you have to.\n\n2. LinkedIn - Use for connecting. Make it more generic.\n\n3. Applying - Use all the tools necessary, but write your own cover letter. Make it short and sweet.\n\n4. General - Its hard for most people out there. I know I am gonna have to switch from mobile to backend or something. Maybe I will try and my luck in the AI developer field... Anyways Thanks guys.

Seems like devs are kind of doing it all - front end, back end, testing, you name it! It's fun and I've been exposed to a lot off cool technologies. I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. \n\nI'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition. I'm worried that I'm not gaining experience on new and cool tech stacks, I'm worried about the no code app conversions. I want to grow, and level up my income. \n\nWhat are some things I should be doing to make the most of this opportunity?",

        "content": "I waited a while before making this post because it didn't feel real at first, and felt like it could all be taken away. But it's been a short while so maybe I feel okay sharing now. Hope I don't jinx it.\n\nI was laid off in October of 2024 from a small consulting company. The company had been contracted at a \\[big tech company\\] for my first year there, and then work dried up so I ended up doing something else for the company. Though, \\[big tech company\\] legally requires that as a contractor, when describing work experience, you're not allowed to say you work for \\[big tech company\\]... you have to point out you are contracted by another company, at \\[big tech company\\]. \n\nIn other words, my work experience leading up to my job hunt was:\n\n* \\[big tech company\\], contracted by \\[consulting company \\] (1 year)\n* \\[consulting company\\] (1 year)\n\nI have severe imposter syndrome, get stuck on Leetcode mediums, feel like I don't possess anything that really makes me special. I've **never** interviewed for a big company before, as I never imagined I could even qualify through technical screenings. I didn't do much job interview research either, other than the \"Blind 75\" lineup of Leetcode problems.\n\nI frequently see people saying doing X or being Y will ruin your chances of getting a job, but I went a step further and really made some major \"mistakes\" during my interviews. So here I was incredibly lucky that things worked out. So the point of this post is just to highlight the absurdity and randomness that can factor into your search. So just believe anything can happen, apply to anything, and be optimistic. \n\nThings I see around this sub that people say will hurt your odds, and I did ALL of them.\n\n* Two column resume layout\n* Not a \"top\" school, public (ranked 30-40)\n* Work at contracting companies\n* Told every interviewer that asked, that I was laid off\n* Late to an interview by 5 minutes\n* Less than average Leetcode skills (50 easy, 50 medium, 3 hard)\n\nBut with each failed interview, I clearly knew where I was lacking, and took home lessons that I focused on hard for the next interview. \n\nFor example, my first interview was with a FAANG company, and it was my first interview in YEARS, let alone my first interview with a big tech company. I was stuttering and stumbling over my words. The company is heavy on behavioral questions so I totally embarrassed myself. I started practicing my storytelling a lot.\n\nWith the next, a medium-sized tech company, I was really enjoying the interview and things were going well. I scheduled each round 2+ weeks away to maximize my preparation time for each one. Just before the hiring manager round, I was told that another candidate accepted an offer and they were cancelling the rest of my interviews. Lesson learned: I should be prepared before any interview is scheduled, and schedule everything at my first availability.\n\nI ended up giving interviews for 6 medium-to-large companies, and received 2 offers. One from FAANG and one from a comparable company. It took me around 7 months ‚Äì I just accepted an offer in April, and started working a month ago. Both offers were way better than anything I was making before, to the point where I felt relieved I didn't make it through the Amazon interview.\n\nI just want to remind everyone that luck is a major factor in the interview process. Good luck everyone, don't give up and remember anything can happen.\n\n",

I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.\n\nI started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn‚Äôt have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I‚Äôm won‚Äôt be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn‚Äôt live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we‚Äôve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn‚Äôt tell me, I asked why she didn‚Äôt say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn‚Äôt say anything either. It was a stab in my back,  it is astonishing how someone can be so cold. I honestly have no idea, I‚Äôm reliving all my steps and I can‚Äôt find something or a little somethings that led to this. I even thought that it could have been homophobia, I‚Äôm bi and since this is pride month, when we met I was wearing some pride apparel, but I think this is a stretch.\n\nNow I‚Äôm here, on my CV there is a 10 month job and now a 5 months job and I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll never find a place again cause who would hire someone like this? I am really lost, do HR really care so much if you look like a job hopper?\n\nFor context I have a little over 10 years experience in performance marketing/tech and jobs where I stayed almost 4 years but still, this looks so bad. I‚Äôm also in Germany if that makes any difference ",

When I started working, things were a bit different I am required to go twice a week (any that I choose tho) and I do have to work from 8 to 5.

I felt like it was totally my fault but bit by bit I am thinking I am not the one that did everything wrong and that it is completely my fault.

I asked my mother and she ask me I had to always reply and she even got mad because I told her that it was outside my working hours.

But does this model exist to the same extent in the US, Canada, UK, Australia..., or do companies there prefer a more direct approach to hiring ?\n\n**Here‚Äôs how it typically works in France, and why it feels problematic :**\n\n* **Heavy use of ESNs (consulting companies)** : Most engineers work on long-term projects (sometimes several years) for client companies, but are officially employees of a consulting company\n* **Claimed flexibility** : Companies say it‚Äôs easier to end a contractor‚Äôs mission but the same is true for permanent employees on a trial period\n* **Supposed lighter HR workload** : In theory, ESNs handle hiring, but the client still interviews and evaluates candidates themselves\n* **\"Temporary\" reinforcement :** Most missions last so long that consultants become de facto internal staff but without the benefits or recognition\n\nIn reality, the drawbacks are significant :\n\n* **More expensive** over time than hiring internal staff\n* **Little to no training** from ESNs : consultants have to upskill on their own\n* **High job insecurity** : consultants can be removed or relocated with very little notice\n* **A general lack of respect** : Many ESNs treat software engineers like interchangeable resources rather than skilled professionals. Since a business developer gets a 2000‚Ç¨ bonus each time he places a consultant on a project, some business developers may not give a fuck whether the mission matches the consultant‚Äôs skills or career goals or if the project is far from the consultant's home. And if the mission fails put all the blame on the consultant. Btw, since ESN have to pay compensations to fire an employee, their \"secret\" technique to get rid of an someone is to repeatedly relocate consultants across the country to uninteresting projects, hoping the employee will eventually resign on their own. But I won't elaborate on all the bad practices of ESNs in this post, because I could write a whole book on this subject.\n* **And definitely the worst of all : LOWER SALARIES** compared to internal employees with similar skills. Half the money the consultant earns goes to the ESN.\n\nThis system creates a kind of vicious circle :\n\nlow pay ‚Äî> less savings ‚Äî> more pressure to accept poor conditions ‚Äî> repeat\n\nAt the end, I don‚Äôt see who actually wins here aside from the ESN profiting from both sides.\n\n**The English-speaking countries model (as I understand it)**\n\n* Companies hire engineers as full-time employees, even for short-term needs ‚Äî it's the 'hire quick, fire quick' approach\n* There's less protection, but also more autonomy and transparency\n* Workers can earn higher salaries because there‚Äôs no intermediary between them and the employer\n\nTo me, this seems healthier even if it‚Äôs more unstable.\n\nBut maybe it's just an impression, so I‚Äôd really like to know : Is this accurate ?\n\n**To sum up, my questions for engineers in English-speaking countries :**\n\n1. Do companies rely heavily on contractors, or is direct hiring the norm ?\n2. Are there equivalents to the French-style ESN system ?\n3. Does the ‚Äúhire quick, fire quick‚Äù approach actually make the work more efficient ?\n\nI‚Äôm asking all this out of curiosity and a bit of frustration. This is quite a hot topic in France. Here, the current system seems to serve the interests of consulting firms more than the people actually doing the work.  \nSo I wonder : is the ‚ÄúAnglo-American‚Äù model actually better, or does it simply have different drawbacks ?  \nBecause honestly, if the French model turns out to be significantly worse for building a career, I'm seriously considering moving abroad to have a decent quality of life.\n\nLooking forward to reading your perspectives.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "author": "Valuable_Mall228",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated 3 years ago, it's a bit of a personal story, and one that I'm honestly not sure how to share with an employer but here it is (the story can be skipped as I don't know if it's relevant to my situation, regardless of why, I haven't been employed in industry for 3 years):\n\nAt around the time of my graduation date I stumbled across the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial. Amber Heard really reminded me of my brother but I wasn't sure why. As she got diagnosed with NPD and BPD I looked into it and the covert narc description happened to completely match my brother.\n\nI had a lot of mental health challenges growing up but I managed to keep it together when it came to my education. Got A\\* Maths, A\\* Computer science A-levels, graduated CS with a First-Class Integrated Masters from a reputable university. But when I came across this piece of news my whole world flipped upside down. So many things started to make sense and I went through a wild emotional rollercoaster. Hadn't cried in 10 years since I was 13 but for at least 2 weeks I would be weeping 6hrs/day and I honestly didn't know what to make of my life.  \nI had to get a job fast after graduating since I didn't want to live back home so I got hired at McDonalds. My mental health was fragile during this time and it took me 6 months to get a job in retail. Only a year after that had I actually started applying to CS jobs.\n\nAs soon as my CV hit the market I started getting calls from recruiters, at least 2 calls/week. I started making some progress with some companies but a friend of mine from McDonalds hit me up and convinced me to start a business. It's a long story with him, but basically he came to the UK by selling his business for 40K pounds. He had a small thing where he bought bicycle parts in some dodgy auction and used them to make bicycles and sell them. He worked at McD to earn the rest of what he needed to pay off his tuition fee (he had to pay 21K/year as he was not from the EU/UK). I resonated with the idea of being self-employed and the guy seemed competent enough and I thought YOLO, why not.\n\n3-4 months into that whole process I realised I really craved some financial security and it'd be a waste not to use my degree. So I quit and started applying to jobs again. I got very close with a video game apprenticeship (was the 11th applicant out of 300 but they only had 10 positions). And I also got an interview for a job through a uni connection that went really well. I had been given a call and was told that I have the job! just have to be on the lookout for HR to contact me. No contact, I stayed in touch via email and eventually called and the hiring manager told me he doesn't know what's happening and the job seems to be in the air. He's signed everything and so has his boss he is just on lookout for the final business approval. He told me he'll contact me if anything changes, so I can only assume nothing changed.\n\nAfter this whole foray I was a little bit low and my friend sweeps in again to offer me to start our own thing. Great timing. Won't go into the details of that but we did a lot of work but were delayed by waiting for my passport to arrive from Romania to the UK as we needed ID to start the business bank account. Just when we were starting to do outreach and get some customers the guy started behaving very poorly towards me. Very passive aggressive, would tell me to do shit for him, etc. When I confronted him about it he called me sensitive, etc. I just couldn't deal with that kind of behaviour so we split up.\n\nIt's been a while at this point since I actually graduated and I learned so many things about myself. I thought for a while maybe I don't want to do CS and I went on to try to be self-employed. It turns out I'm a little too fragile for that at the moment, I don't quite have enough self-determination for it and I've lived for 2.5 years in a constant state of anxiety (as my current workplace is quite toxic and demanding as well). I just need a little bit of breathing room and some financial stability to pull myself together enough to actually attempt something like that.\n\nThis brings me to now, 3 years later, applying to jobs yet again but now I'm honestly worried since it seems like the market is not in a great place, and my gap is getting quite large.\n\nIs there any point in me applying to CS related jobs at the moment? Does anyone have any advice for how to stand out in this market given this disadvantage?",

I tried to ask what does it mean but got only vague answers.\n\nOn my part, I am always nice and open to other people - at least thats what I think of myself, but sometimes I have to draw a thick line when, for example: someone entrusts me with a task that goes beyond my competence or scope of duties - think of setting up infrastructure, when its managed by client infra team and I got no permissions. Of course, I do not say \"no\" leaving the person alone with the problem, I suggest who can help and how to do it, sometimes I even engage people to help. \n\n\n\nI have the impression that any objection, which is not really an objection, and I really cannot do certain things myself, is perceived as my flaw.

If the situation were reversed, I would probably be removed from the project. Often, even despite previous suggestions that something might go wrong, my opinion is ignored until the thing happens and then there are complaints about it. \n\n\n\nHere I come to the conclusion that communication is simply taking everything upon yourself, nodding to everything (being a yes-man) and pretending that everything is going well, even when it isn't?

Since then, I've filled out some onboarding documents and I've booked a flight and hotel through a platform they provided for me to come to their HQ to do onboarding. This gives me a bit of relief since I imagine nothing funny should happen if I've already paid almost 3k using their card on flights + hotel, but reading the posts on this sub where offers have been pulled due to restructuring, budgeting, etc, has now made me very nervous.\n\nI haven't heard anything back since I sent in my documents and it still says \"Report Pending\" on the platform I did my background check on, and I haven't received any new documents in my Workday account either.\n\nShould I reach out to my manager with some question (I do have tons of questions but I imagine they'd be covered during my onboarding at HQ) to sort of show like \"Hey I'm still here haha\" or just leave it alone?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey guys, here‚Äôs my situation. I‚Äôm a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I‚Äôve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I‚Äôm not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I‚Äôd really like one and I‚Äôm only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.\n\nFor some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I‚Äôm not getting much traction - I‚Äôm probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would‚Äôve taken me about 3 years and I would‚Äôve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn‚Äôt think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it‚Äôs been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.\n\nAll that said, do you think it‚Äôs worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I‚Äôm thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it‚Äôs causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it‚Äôs either WGU MSCS or nothing - I‚Äôm just at a point in my life where I‚Äôm done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I‚Äôm not considering any other masters programs.\n\nI do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I‚Äôve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a track record issue.",

        "content": "Hello. I've been working for around 2.5 years in a startup as a senior backend engineer.\n\nWhen I started, we were 2 on the team, under the CTO. 1 person left. We hired someone terrible, and we didn't continue with him after a few months. I proposed to not replace this person with anyone because the workload was ok-ish just for me. I was the only backend engineer for more than one year, managing (successfully) around 1/3 third of the product (several microservices etc).\n\nDuring this period, the CTO was changed because of investors' wishes. A few months back, we hired a couple of more people for my team, but they are nowhere close to my productivity or domain knowledge, and are on-par or below my general technical knowledge. \n\nI get along with everyone, I have good communication skills, and I've gotten 2 raises during this time. This is why I was expecting to become a Tech lead when it was time to have one.\n\nUnfortunately, we (i was included in the call) are interviewing for an external technical lead. This has been extremely disappointing. When asking my CTO, he said that they wanted someone with experience in leading teams who could effectively help with the refactors that we need, and so on.\n\nI'm more than capable (or at least that's what i think) of planning and managing long projects and make them happen through incremental steps, but this new CTO has never let me do that because he always proposes more long-term, breaking refactorings. So we are kind of stuck in urgent things and bugs (that obviously should not happen on the first place) and not moving forward with the important topics.\n\nI have the impression that they (the CTO and the CEO) have already made the decision not to count on me to promote to teach lead, because otherwise they would have, at least, spoken with me about what I'm not good at or something.\n\nSo Im wondering if it make sense to push for it anyway. For example, writing a detailed technical proposal of the refactors that we need, and having another conversation with my CTO. But one part of me thinks that this would be a waste of my time and would only lead to an uncomfortable conversation in which no one wins. \n\nWhat do you think? Any similar experience? Thanks!",

My BA in CS didn't teach me much about front end (react, graphql...) but I have had so much fun learning these things :)\n\nI feel like I've hit a learning plateau, though, and many people my age are pursuing masters degrees or attending other types of schools. I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.\n\nI currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.\n\nI just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great. I feel lost :/ any advice would be really helpful <3 Thank you!\n\nI couldn't post in /frontend for some reason :/ so I'm hoping for some advice here if thats okay ",

I have seen a lot of posts arguing if the follow-up thank you is not harmful but maybe helpful, inconsequential, or even annoying. I do not have the contact info of the people I interviewed with (IT director and the software devs), only the HR person I did my first round online interview with. Is it worth trying to contact the HR person to relay a thank you email to the second round interview panel? I did not send a follow up email for the first interview. I really want this job, I think I did pretty good on most of the interview, I just don‚Äôt know if the follow up is worth it as I‚Äôve heard incredibly mixed things about it online.",

        "author": "apgthrowaway_",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I'm a new grad torn between two offers. One is SRE at a company that is mid-sized, tech/AI oriented, enterprise, good recent funding, seems really stable, GlassDoor reviews seem positive, unlimited PTO (that reviews say was usually approved), has good benefits but would require relocating. Another is SWE at a smaller start-up ish, can't find any info online about their revenue and funding, almost no GlassDoor reviews, no unlimited PTO, 7 year old e-commerce company.\n\nSalary wise due to relocating they both kind of wind up being the same net for me.\n\nMy brother who's worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft for a few years (but never worked in SWE) is telling me that the smaller company SWE position w slightly worse benefits is much better because the industry is so competitive right now that if you only have experience as an SRE it'll be hard to pivot to other roles in the future, and that it's a much better setup for my future career than an SRE role. He also said that it's better to work at a e-commerce marketplace company because the skills will be more transferrable and a lot of FAANG type companies will like that, whereas the enterprise AI company experience wouldn't be as direct.\n\nAnother engineer I talked to said the job titles don't matter that much, I'll only be able to tell once I start the job and know exactly what I'm doing that I'll know how useful the learned skills are, best I can do is look at the job description.\n\nSo I'm torn on what to do. If the job titles were the same I'd go with the mid-sized company 100%. But since the smaller company where I'm not sure about the work culture has the better title *and* doesn't require me to relocate I'm really not sure. Any advice on what it seems like the better role is, if SWE is that much better as my brother says it is? Idk I feel like the SRE position is at a company with such a stronger future. \n\nIf it helps, the SWE role works with C#, they said I'll be doing some QA and automation with Selenium. The SRE role will be working with Playwright and Kubernetes. I have no idea which of those skills would be more useful in the industry and neither does my brother/other engineer friend lol.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "#Hey guys, I‚Äôm posting for a friend who doesn‚Äôt have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you\n \nI‚Äôm currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I‚Äôve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems.\n  \nTo pursue this, I‚Äôm considering enrolling in a Master‚Äôs in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics.\n  \nThat said, I‚Äôm wondering if a single Philosophy master‚Äôs is the most efficient path‚Äîor if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master‚Äôs in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I‚Äôm well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains.\n  \nMy key questions are: \n \n* Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master‚Äôs degree (or two) be sufficient?\n* Would pursuing two Master‚Äôs degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?\n* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?\n* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs?\n  \nThank you so much for your time and any advice you can share‚ÄîI deeply appreciate it.",
