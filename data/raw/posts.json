It seems like creating Cloud SQL Instances requires a lot of memorization of SQL syntax and conceptual knowledge of SQL. I don't think I have issues with SQL conceptual knowledge. I do have issues with memorizing all of the SQL syntax and granular steps.\n\nMy questions are this -\n\n1. Do data engineers remember all the steps and syntax needed to create Cloud SQL Instances or do they just reference documentation?\n2. Furthermore, do data engineers just memorize conceptual knowledge of SQL, Python, the terminal, etc. or do you memorize granular syntax and steps too?\n\nI assume that you just reference documentation because it seems like a lot of granular steps and syntax to memorize. I also assume that those granular steps and syntax become outdated quickly as programming languages continue to be updated.\n\nThank you for your time.  \nApologies if my question doesn't make sense. I am still in the beginner phases of learning data engineering.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all for your responses. I highly appreciate it.",

I am also familiar beyond the basic configs options.\n\nI am now focusing on spark, and learning its internal. I already can write basic pyspark. I have built a bit of portfolio to showcase my work. I also am very comfortable with Tableau for data visualisation.\n\nI’ve built a small portfolio of projects to demonstrate my learning.

I am want to understand on what to improve, what’s missing, or how I can make my work more relevant to real-world expectations\n\nI worked for radisson hotels as a reservation analyst. Therefore, my projects are around automation in restaurant management.\n\nIf anyone needs help with a project (within my areas of expertise), I’d be more than happy to contribute in return.\n\nLastly, I’m currently open to internships or entry-level opportunities in Data Engineering.

        "content": "Code’s here: [github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia)\n\nWe're building Onyxia: an open source, self-hosted environment manager for Kubernetes, used by public institutions, universities, and research organizations around the world to give data teams access to tools like Jupyter, RStudio, Spark, and VSCode without relying on external cloud providers.\n\nThe project started inside the French public sector, where sovereignty constraints and sensitive data made AWS or Azure off-limits. But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.\n\nAt its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.\n\nHighlights:\n- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.\n- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.\n- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.\n- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).\n- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.\n- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.\n\nThere’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).\n\nIf your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",

If you're confused too, here's what I've learned:\n\n **Which one should you use?**\n\n**Kubeflow Spark-Operator:** The battle-tested option (since 2017!) if you need production-ready features NOW. Great for scheduled ETL jobs, has built-in cron, Prometheus metrics, and production-grade stability.\n\n**Apache Spark K8s Operator:** Brand new (v0.2.0, May 2025) but it's the official ASF project. Written from scratch to support long-running Spark clusters and newer Spark 3.5/4.x features. Choose this if you need on-demand clusters or Spark Connect server features.\n\nApparently, the Apache team started fresh because the older Kubeflow operator's Go codebase and webhook-heavy design wouldn't fit ASF governance. Core maintainers say they might converge APIs eventually.\n\nWhat's your take? Which one are you using in production?",

It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.\n\nI went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.\n\nI want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.\n\nSo before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

That said, I was pretty much thrown into the deep end, and while I’ve learned a lot through trial and error, I do wish that I had started under a senior who could be a mentor for me.\n\nFiguring out things myself has sort of a double edge, where on one hand, the process of figuring out has sometimes lead to new learning endeavours while sometimes I'm just left wondering: Is this really the optimal solution? \n\nSo, I’m hoping to get some advice from this community:\n\n# 1. Mentorship & Guidance\n\n* How did you find a mentor (internally or externally)?\n* Are there communities (Slack, Discord, forums) you’d recommend joining?\n* Are there folks in the data space worth following (blogs, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)? I currenlty follow Zack wilson and a few others who can be found by surface level research into the space.\n\n# 2. Conferences & Meetups\n\n* Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?\n* Any recommendations for events that are beginner-friendly and actually useful for someone in a role like mine?\n\n# 3. Improving as a Solo Data Engineer\n\n* Any learning paths or courses that helped you understand more than just what works but also *w*hy?",

        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI’m tasked with grabbing data from one db about devices and using a rest api to pull information associated with it. The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn’t seem the most efficient.\n\nAdditionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. \n\n\nNote: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directly\n\nDoes my current approach seem valid? I am eager to learn if there are any tools that would work great in my situation or if there are any glaring flaws.\n\nThanks!\n",

We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.\n\nMy manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory. \n\n  \nEach listingId file is quite small (few Kbs), so it doesn't make sense for one parquet file to only contain info about a single listingId. \n\nI wanted to ask if someone has accomplished something like this before.

I’ve noticed that a couple of my colleagues have different understandings of what goes in the valid_from and valid_to columns. \nOne says that they get snapshots of the day before and that the business wants the reports based on the day that the data was in the source system and therefore we should put current_date -1 in the valid_from.\n\nThe other colleague says that it should be the current_date because that’s when we are inserting it in the dwh. Argument is that when a snapshot hasn’t been delivered you are missing that data and the next day it is delivered, you’re telling the business that’s the day it was active in the source system, while that might not be the case.\n\nPersonally, second argument sounds way more logical and bullet proof since the burden won’t be on us, but I also get the first argument.\n\nWondering how you’re doing this in your projects.\n\n",

Our coverage is sitting at 62% because we're just basically calling the master function to call all the other private methods associated with the transformation (deduplication, casting, etc.).\n\nWe pushed back and said that the core transformation and business logic is already being captured by the tests that we have and that our effort will be best spent on refining our current tests (introduce failing tests, edge cases, etc.) instead of trying to get 90% code coverage.\n\nDid anyone experienced this before? \n\n",

        "author": "bebmfec",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have quite a complex SQL query within DBT which I have been tasked to build an API 'on top of'.\n\nMore specifically, I want to create an API that allows users to send input data (e.g., JSON with column values), and under the hood, it runs my dbt model using that input and returns the transformed output as defined by the model.\n\nFor example, suppose I have a dbt model called `my_model` (in reality the model is a lot more complex):\n\n    select \n        {{ macro_1(\"col_1\") }} as out_col_1,\n        {{ macro_2(\"col_1\", \"col_2\") }} as out_col_2\n    from \n        {{ ref('input_model_or_data') }}\n    \n\nNormally, `ref('input_model_or_data')` would resolve to another dbt model, but I’ve seen in dbt unit tests that you can inject synthetic data into that `ref()`, like this:\n\n    - name: test_my_model\n      model: my_model\n      given:\n        - input: ref('input_model_or_data')\n          rows:\n            - {col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}\n      expect:\n        rows:\n          - {out_col_1: \"out_val_1\", out_col_2: \"out_val_2\"}\n    \n\nThis allows the test to override the input source. I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: \"out_val_1\", out_col_2: \"out_val_2\"}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.\n\nWhat’s the recommended way to do something like this?",

Orchestration is handled with cron jobs running on several linux servers.\n\nWe have a new project coming up that will require us to build around 200–300 pipelines. They’re not too complex, but the volume is significant given what we run today. I don’t want to overengineer things but I think we’re reaching a point where we need orchestration with auto scaling. I also see benefits in introducing database/table layering with raw, structured, and ready-to-use data, going from ETL to ELT.\n\nI’m considering airflow on kubernetes, python pipelines, and layered postgres. Everything runs on-prem and we have a dedicated infra/devops team that manages kubernetes today.\n\nI try to keep things simple and avoid introducing new technology unless absolutely necessary, so I’d like some feedback on this direction.

I want to help my family financially, but I’m failing to pick one skill and stick with it.\n\nI love tech, but I’m also thinking of doing odd jobs again, just to survive. I feel like I’m wasting my best years watching tutorials and configuring my editor.\n\n**My questions to this community**:\n\n* Has anyone been through this kind of burnout or paralysis?\n* How do you stop jumping stacks/tools and just commit?\n* How do I finally start earning — even $100/month — to break this cycle?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I’m posting this not to complain, but to hear from real people. This is my first time posting. Maybe I just want to feel seen by people who understand.",

I have decent enough problem solving skills but I take a long time and I struggle to comprehend math and numbers.\n\nCan I still be a good programmer? Is it something anyone can pick up, or does your brain have to work in a specific way?\n\nI’ve looked at the FAQ and done some research already, but I really want to hear your honest experience with programming and how accessible it is.\n \nThanks all :)\n\n\nEdit: Wow!!! Thank you so so much for the replies everyone. I am at work but I’m going to read through and respond later today. I didn’t expect nearly this much support, I appreciate you all.\n\nJust to add some more information- I have no experience yet. I just started taking a free online course and playing with scratch literally yesterday. I’ve always loved games but until now have been focusing on improving my creative abilities (art and writing) so that I can create a decent game, and now I think I’m finally at a good spot with that so I’m moving to the next step (programming). \n\nI am a very good reader, and can be good at problem solving, but I have fairly severe ADHD which makes it hard to keep track of things. I think it will be challenging, but it’s something I’m passionate about so I’m willing to put in the effort. Thank you all so much!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so much everybody. I couldn’t respond to everyone without sounding repetitive, but I read through every comment and am so grateful to you all for taking the time to give me your opinions and advice. I think I may struggle in some areas more than others might, but I am so determined and excited to make this happen. You’re all amazing!! I appreciate you so much",

        "author": "idk-who-you-are",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m 22 and about to graduate with a Master’s in Computer Applications. I don’t have a job yet, and honestly, I feel completely stuck and left behind.\n\nWhen I was 14, I found out about software engineering after my neighbor moved to the US. That lit a fire in me—I started dreaming of becoming a great engineer, moving abroad, doing something meaningful. I pushed hard through 9th and 10th grades believing that hard work now would lead to success later.\n\nThen the lockdown hit just as I entered my Bachelor's. I learned a bit of programming, but I also wasted a lot of time—watching movies, helping at home, and losing direction.\n\nIn 2022, I tried learning web development. I got a job I didn’t enjoy, then an internship where I couldn’t perform well. I tried React, but it felt overwhelming. Since then, I’ve bounced between DSA, frontend, Golang, and trying to build projects—but nothing sticks. Most projects remain unfinished. I’m not proud of anything I’ve built.\n\nI try starting projects, but I lose interest after two or three days. The initial excitement fades quickly, and I struggle to push through once things get repetitive or challenging. I feel stuck in a loop—excited to begin, but unable to finish. This keeps happening, and it kills my confidence even more.\n\nNow it’s 2025, and I feel like I’ve lost the **curiosity and excitement** that got me into tech in the first place. Programming doesn’t excite me anymore—it feels like just another boring subject I’m forcing myself through. I accept that YouTube and social media made tech look glamorous, and I got pulled into that version. But now I realize—it’s only fulfilling if you truly love the work.\n\nI have a short attention span. I give up easily when I hit bugs. I don’t learn frameworks or concepts as fast as I think I should. I feel like I’m not cut out for this.\n\nThe worst part? I’m scared I’ll be stuck as someone mediocre forever. I lie awake at night thinking, *What if I’m falling behind in this race? What if I missed the boat? What if I end up like someone who fell out during the dot-com bubble and never recovered?*\n\nMeanwhile, I see people younger than me building amazing things, earning well, learning fast. It crushes me.\n\nMy family—especially my parents and older brother—are amazing and supportive. They never pressure me, but I know deep down they want me to start earning. A few days ago, my mom quietly said, *“I thought you’d do something to change things at home, but you couldn’t.”* That sentence shattered me. I want to help them financially and emotionally. But I haven’t earned a single **dime** yet.\n\nI’ve been cold-emailing founders, CTOs, and employees on LinkedIn, and applying to jobs almost every day—but I keep getting rejections or no responses at all. It’s disheartening.\n\nSometimes, I want to give up. But I also don’t want to. There’s still a small part of me that wants to break through, to build something meaningful, and to prove to myself that I *can* do it.\n\nI want to make it in tech. I want to be good at it. I still dream of building cool products and figuring out how things work. But I just don’t know how to keep going when everything feels overwhelming. I want to feel motivated again. I want to believe it’s not too late for me.\n\nLately, I’ve been interested in backend development, but I know frontend is important too—and after failing so many times at it, frontend feels boring and intimidating. Starting again feels stupid and exhausting.\n\nSorry if I sound like a complaint box or just another burnt-out CS guy. I just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nIf anyone has been through this—or made it out of this kind of mental/emotional/technical rut—please let me know:  \n**How do you stay consistent when your confidence is shattered?**  \n**How do you bring back the excitement and curiosity for tech?**  \n**How do you stop feeling like a failure?**\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n22, finishing MCA. Lost interest and motivation in programming. Tried web dev, Go, DSA—nothing sticks. Projects remain incomplete. Haven’t earned a dime yet. Family is supportive but I feel like I’ve let them down. Programming feels boring now; glamorized YouTube content pulled me in. I’m cold emailing founders, CTOs, employees and applying for jobs—but facing rejections. I’m scared of falling behind forever. Still want to succeed in tech but don’t know how. Backend interests me, frontend feels overwhelming. Looking for advice, support, or just someone who understands.",

        "content": "Hi all,  \nI recently created a fun cipher that encodes text using the digits of π. I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!\n\n## How the cipher works:\n- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.\n- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).\n- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.\n- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.\n\n### Example:\nThe ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`.  \nIf `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...),  \nthen it's encoded as:\n```\n7-2\n```\n---\n\n## Here’s an encrypted message:\n```\n11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2\n```\n---\n\n## And here’s the Python code to decode it:\n```python\nfrom mpmath import mp\n\nmp.dps = 100005  # digits of π\npi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]\n\ncipher_text = (\n    \"11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2\"\n)\n\nsegments = cipher_text.strip().split(\"-\")\nindex_length_pairs = [\n    (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1]))\n    for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)\n]\n\ndecoded_chars = []\nfor index, length in index_length_pairs:\n    ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length]\n    decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))\n\ndecoded_message = \"\".join(decoded_chars)\nprint(decoded_message)\n```\n---\n\n### Tutorial Flair\n\nThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.  \nIt walks through reading the encoded index-length pairs, mapping them to ASCII values found in the digits of π, and reconstructing the original message using Python.\n\nFeel free to adapt the script to experiment with your own messages or tweak the ciphering method.

If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS. \n\nEveryone's journey is different, but if you feel you dig yourself in too easily when dealing with passing data around, try it!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a junior fullstack developer with just under a year of experience. I work at a small software house that maintains and develops a few internal apps and services.\n\nLately, I’ve been feeling extremely frustrated with the direction my work has taken, and I’m not sure if I’m just being unrealistic or if this is genuinely a toxic environment. I’d love some outside perspective.\n\nWhen I started, I was trained in the company's main stack – NestJS (Node) and React – and I was excited to grow in that tech. But for the past few months, I’ve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:\n\n* Creating automations in low-code tools\n* Researching integrations with outdated platforms\n* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)\n\nTo make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.\n\nI'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I’m falling behind. There’s barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I’m not learning or growing in the direction I want.\n\nOn top of all that, I’m working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I’m putting in real effort but I feel like I’m getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.\n\nI do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I’m hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I’m worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.\n\nSo I'm stuck in this limbo — should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through? Or is this a sign that I should look for a better environment?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through something similar. Thanks in advance!",

However, the knowledge you learn in CS are not only just programming: data structures, data algorithm, statistics, linear algebra, compilers etc. How do you apply these knowledges in workplace? And do you recommend me to do CS or engineering?",

I got halfway thought the tutor because i havent had much time recently.\n\nMy question is: Why would you want to use Vim and other terminal based editors (which might not be IDEs out of the box) when you could use something like Visual Studio (which is very popular) with something that lets you use vim motions, commands, macros and all of that good stuff that Vim has?  \nI'm sure that you can make your editor of choice work only with a keyboard, and customize it to your needs. Why use something like Vim then?",

When I see people talking about projects they talk about Java swing and others but I've been told that learning java swing now is not that useful.\n\nAnd as java swing is for gui's and frontend too which would be better for me to learn HTML,css,Js or Java swing because I want to more go into back end development but also want to know how to do frontend if I ever want to build an app.\n\nI was thinking to learn Springboot but I'm not sure if I should already start it or learn something else before.\n\nCould anyone guide me/give me advice?\n\nSorry for the confusion",

From today to when I first touched Python to send signals to a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins on a breadboard, it's been about 5 years. I rediscovered my love for programming after taking a bare-bones robotics class that just so happened to allow programming in Python. Since that ended, I've been trying to get back into the practice as a hobby only to discover I am bored out of my goddamn mind. I've been trying to learn to make little games, but even trying to recreate Pong in Lua makes my eyes glaze over less than 50 lines in. I can't look at an empty shell without getting a pit in my stomach. I like to look at source code to see what makes games tick, and it always feels like I'm learning something, but I always get that same numb feeling if I ever do anything beyond very simple tasks. Anything a more perceptive programmer would be able to see just seeps right through me. The last \"big\" project I ever completed generated bingo boards from a template with random numbers for a friend's project. It felt good to have a problem and slowly figure out how to solve it, and it was the most fun I've had programming in years. How do I get that feeling of euphoria again? I feel like I've forgotten how to even start.",

I have been making a VB .Net WinForms app to archive project directories at work to a different storage raid by scanning all the files/folders recursively and ensuring everything is older than a specified date. It then copies the files to our archive drive. then, it does a binary comparison of the source and copied files to ensure everything was 100% successful before deleting the source file. All that functionality works PERFECTLY. (Picture a shared drive full of folders, each of which is a complete project. If no changes have happened to a project in at least a year, it's safe to archive. Stuff on the archive drive is read-only for most of the company to keep it safe for record keeping and not cluttering up daily work)\n\nFor the next phase, I want it to go through that archive drive and put all the archived directories into compressed files (Zip or 7Zip). So, each project folder becomes its own zip file. Our data is highly compressible, and we can save about 30% space by compressing files that we don't need to be regularly accessing.\n\nI see that this line of code easily creates the zip file for me:\n\n    System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory(FolderPath, OutputZipPath, CompressionLevel.SmallestSize, True)\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Is there a way to verify the file accuracy after zipped before I delete the source files?\n   * I may be over-cautious, but I don't want to risk any file corruptions\n* Is there a different way to compress folders that I should research?\n   * I did my proof-of-concept testing using a batch file that triggered 7zip, but I prefer to keep everything integrated into a single program if possible unless there's a good reason not to.\n\n  \n\n\nedit: minor error: i flipped the percentage of saved space, sorry. they compress to 70% of original size, saving 30%.",

I also tried to make \"simpler\" projects (like ToDo app) but i lost interst in them really quickly. so what project/tips would you recomend?\n\nI think my problem is that I lose motivation quickly when I run into an issue and have to slow down to do research and problem-solving. The progress suddenly feels a LOT slower. Have you guys experienced something similar?\n\nIf you need any more information please aks, any help is appreciated.\n\nPS: the title shit ik ",

        "author": "JuggernautOk681",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve tried learning coding through online courses and YouTube videos earlier, but honestly, I always felt something was missing. Most of the time, I ended up just following what was shown, without actually understanding *why* we were doing something a certain way. The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like “why exactly is this done like this?”\n\nSo now, I’ve decided to start fresh — this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.\n\nHere’s how I’m planning to approach it:\n\n1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.\n2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.\n3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.\n\nI'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.\n\nSo I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:\n\n* Basics of coding and general programming logic\n* Beginner to intermediate Python\n* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)\n* A good path to learn C++ after Python\n* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habits\n\nIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.\n\nIf anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions. Thanks in advance!",

        "title": "After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me.",
        "author": "dethstrobe",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.\n\nJust to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\n# Agile is a Sin\n\nI come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?\n\nWrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.\n\nIt is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.\n\nAlso, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for \"X\" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.\n\n# The Doc Machine\n\nSo, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?\n\nDocs.\n\nEndless docs.\n\nCountless docs.\n\nSo many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.\n\nGoogle's mission is to \"organize the world's information.\" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.\n\nWhat's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.\n\nYou want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.\n\nWhat's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?\n\nThe point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?\n\nI'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.\n\n# Bad docs\n\nIronically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.\n\nWhat is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?\n\nFocusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.\n\nAnd I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.\n\n# A Culture of Silence\n\nSo, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)\n\nThere is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.\n\nComing from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.\n\nIt is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.\n\n# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)\n\nSo, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.\n\n# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick Wall\n\nSo, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.\n\nSo let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.\n\nSounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?\n\nWhat I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.\n\n# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible Deniability\n\nLet's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.\n\nFundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.\n\nI understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.\n\n# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by Apathy\n\nLet's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?\n\nSo you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, \"bottom-up\" kind of stuff.\n\nYou present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.\n\nBut literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.\n\nThe reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.\n\n# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going Nowhere\n\nIf there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.\n\n# There is No Team in I\n\nSo, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.\n\nThat's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.\n\n[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.\n\nI hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.\n\nIt could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *\"leaning on others too much.\"* How else am I supposed to read that?\n\nI've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.\n\n# Performative Theater\n\nI hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.\n\n1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.\n\nSo, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.\n\nWhen they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.\n\n# Tech Debt Forever\n\nTo say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.\n\nCryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.\n\nSo I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, \"It sounds like you need mentorship.\" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, \"maybe you should find your own mentorship.\" And it does make me wonder, \"what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?\" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.\n\n# I'm out\n\nSo I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.\n\nThey gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.\n\nThere is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.\n\nI used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",

My question is: **Are there any accountants that switched FROM accounting to SWE? Why did you do so? What were the downsides of accounting that made you switch?**\n\nIt just seems like a way better fit for me personally. I always just wanted a stable, in-demand career that pays moderately well and has good work life balance. I was never interested in FAANG (even though I ended up working at 3 of them, and starting my career there.. but all that did was lead me to an insane burnout and I now work as a SWE at a bank).\n\nI'm jealous of:\n\n* The biggest one for me, is that their work is deterministic. They know when they walk into work that day, exactly what they will do and how long it will take them to do. In SWE? Not the case. I'm given a puzzle that I've never done before, given a deadline to finish it, and asked every single day (multiple times) how close I am to finishing it.\n* The fact that once they do their time at the Big 4 + get their CPA, they are basically set for life. The grind ACTUALLY seems to pay off in their career. In tech? You have to study LeetCode, OOP, System Design over and over and over every time you want to job hop\n* The fact that it's a stable job and literally everyone needs them.\n* The fact that their interviews consist of 1-2 behavioural rounds and that's literally it\n* Immune to AI and offshoring due to legal reasons\n\nAm I looking at accounting too positively?

But the second B, meaning businesses which buy AI subscriptions en masse, are tech businesses which want to replace their software engineers.  \n  \nHowever, a large percentage of those sell software to software engineers or other tech companies or tech inclined people.

        "content": "https://issues.org/stem-workforce-shortage-data-hira/\n\nData doesn't lie. Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT  everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially  tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?\n\nFurther, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called \"Schedule A\" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.\n\nBut the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. \nBut it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.\n\nIf the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have \"H1B\" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?\n\nIt seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their \"facts\" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",

During my job hunting journey, I have applied for more than 800 jobs, conducted more than 70 interviews, and was a finalist in the hiring process about 10 times. Yet regardless of that, there was always a candidate more favorable than me which got chosen, until this exact day.\n\nToday I have received an email which was quite unexpected. I have been offered a full-time remote position as a junior software engineer in an international mid-sized company, with big customer base and highly distributed systems. The offer I received is realistic and slightly above average for my years of experience and the consideration it's a fully remote position, therefore I have gladly signed it and accepted it.\n\nThe agenda of my post is first and foremost spreading some positivity and hope in this Subreddit in these tough market conditions, because I feel like many people can use it here as a motivation to keep trying. Secondly, I would like to celebrate this moment here in this Subreddit and post about the good times, the same as I did when I posted about the bad times.\n\nI wish everyone out there the best of luck in their job hunting journey, and as I said I want to shed some light and spread positivity proving that it is possible to get offers with the right skills, hard work, consistency, and a bit of luck.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.\n\nNow, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.\n\nIn college, I was a premed as well as a CS major. I had everything from lab research to volunteer hours, from the courses to the MCAT—all I had to do was send the med school applications. Then I chose to pursue tech instead. After years in the real world, I'm doubting my choice.\n\n**I'm not building things that matter. Most times, I'm not building at all.** Most of my time and energy is devoted to navigating office politics. I didn't sign up for this. I certainly can't imagine 30 more years in this career.\n\nI'm still searching for a new job. But if I don't get an offer in the next few months, I'll be studying again for the MCAT. (My old score expired—what a waste.)\n\nMedicine will be a long and tough road. I'll be working longer hours with less flexibility for somewhat less pay. But at least I'll be doing something that matters, something that makes me proud to go to work every morning. I'll have stress that's meaningful, and a sense of professional fulfillment beyond just my TC.\n\nAnd most of all, I won't have to deal with office politics, every day, every week, every year.",

        "content": "Three and a half years ago I graduated college and was pulled into a startup as the only US dev in a US startup for a full-stack position. The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the \"Go-To Person\" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.\n\nBefore we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with \"expert knowledge\" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with \"expert knowledge\", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).\n\nBecause of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an \"Ask a Dev\" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones \"Super Urgent!\" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...\n\nSo take this as a warning. Don't become the \"Go-To Person\" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity.\n\n  \nEdit: Spelling/grammer errors. I'm sure there is more, but I need to stop ranting and actually work",

Not something totally out there like medicine or law or anything that requires starting over from scratch but something new, something that might still use my coding or technical skills without being pure software development.\n\nThe problem is, I don’t even know where to start looking. What kinds of jobs would let me stay in tech (or close to it) without being in the trenches of code all day? What kind of roles value dev experience but let you do something different—more people-facing, strategic, or creative?\n\nHas anyone here actually made a career shift out of software dev?

        "content": "I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a “Controls and Automation Specialist”. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.\n\nI didn’t think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn’t heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn’t until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between “Specialists” and “Engineers” in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.\n\nWhen I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a “Computer Science” degree, I’m not considered an engineer and can’t be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn’t yet considered “real” engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).\n\nI have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn’t expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it’s been hard not to feel like I’m missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.\n\nHas anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? \n\nWould love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.\n\nTLDR:\nCS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an \"Engineer\" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn’t labeled “Engineering,” despite doing similar work.

Our customers don't like it when they realize that the person they're asking for help actually has no idea because they're a software dev cosplaying as a store employee. \"What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.\"\n\n2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking \"I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job\".\n\n3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on. And instead of me being there, why can't it just be an email from them directly to management? and how many more times am I going to have to keep doing this?\n\nAfter completing one of these visits I'm given an opportunity to fill out a survey which I always do, but then in the future I'm still told basically \"do it or you're fired\". It feels like a bait and switch to me because I joined this company to be a software dev and this program didn't exist at that time.\n\nI know the job market is bad at the moment so I'm continuing to comply, but I just wanted to vent to my fellow devs I guess.",

        "content": "# tldr: Twice in the past year I was hired in companies (employed on full time and paid) while doing absolutely nothing (never put on any project).\n\nHi, I'm backend/fullstack developer with experience of just few years.\n\nLast year I spent 6 months doing absolutely NOTHING in the big IT company from India. I was hired as developer in a project for a client from finance/fintech industry. The project was postponed or never started, and I've spent my entire time in there doing absolutely nothing, however I was told that they will find replacement project for me eventually, then 1 month before the end of my employment contract I was suggested to look for another job as they won't extend my employment. Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.\n\n**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**\n\nNow my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out. I was hired as backend dev at the beginning of the year, and so far I had few internal interviews for the various projects, but I don't even get feedback from them.\n\n**As I learned from my previous experience I have found another job as the contractor in the bank and I'm doing great here.**\n\nMy employment in the do-nothing-company terminates in few months and I'm not resigning until they actually try put me on a project. I don't feel like I am cheating because this is second time that someone wastes my time. I'm still a beginner in the industry and in this very crowded market on every single interview everyone asks me about my experience in all the companies I've been working for - **I don't want to lie on my resume, but I also don't want to tell my interviewer that professionally I was not engaged in any project/team since the end of 2023, and why I am jumping between companies after barely 6 months of employment.**\n\nSo, do you have experience like this? I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid. Here I was full time employed, got paid and contributed absolutely nothing, twice. I probably won't even mention my current do-nothing-company on my CV.\n\nI'm sick of companies that are looking for developer while not having any position for them. And I completely understand that this is kind of a privilige nowadays and sounds like a dream job for many people, but in IT every year of your experience counts, and If you was hired on paper but got nothing from it, then it's going to turn out terribly for you in the future. Of course in both of those companies I tried to utilize my time and try to learn/work with new things on my own, but this is not the same. And obviously for the entire past year I was constantly stressed, not sure about my future and I felt there was no stability in my life and that something is wrong with me.",

Yeah I believe that as a CS guy/gal, you might not be responsible for building and developing complex systems that communicate and work with each other (in fact I believe 2025 SWE is just  Distributed Systems in disguise but we can argue about that in my next post)\n\nMy question: is there really any field within CS that does not require at least some programming skills for survival (and No I'm not talking a FullStack Dev, maybe a niche position)?\n\nContext:  \n1.I always thought **Networking** was how I would escape programming. Sure, there are many tools that automate some of these processes, but from my tiny experience in this domain, there seems to be many situations where writing custom scripts gives you the advantage?\n\n2.**System Admins/CyberSecurity:** C'mon Sys Admins/CyberSecurity Consultants, you shouldn't even be in this discussion since I know you guys have to or perhaps should automate some of those tasks you handle every day lol\n\n3\\*\\*.UI/UX Designers:\\*\\*  A lot of the UI/UX designers in my circle were slowly funneled into jobs that required them to also know some FE Programming. (This might be an issue within my country). After that, they slowly realized FE isn't enough and you gotta know some BE. And the current market push in my country is forcing FullStack devs into DevOps\n\n4.**DB Admins**: Early in my admin, a client asked my company to switch from SQL to MongoDB for reasons...that was hell. They had 100s of thousands of documents\n\nSo again, what are these jobs that do not require programming and especially Leetcode\n\n**Edit: please share what tips you got!** ",

Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.\n\n\n\nI interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.\n\nDuring that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.\n\nIt’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).\n\nI’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.\n\nThis company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.\n\nI know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind. Especially given that the team I’d join only has a handful of developers (maybe 3).",

I'm trying to specialize in something that won’t wear down my body and ideally lets me have stronger financial security.\n\nI'm only a semester into the degree but I have to be honest spending time on this subreddit and others related to tech careers has been discouraging. Even other industries display the same issues. It seems like everywhere you look whether it's CS & IT, business & finance, Legal & Administrative or any other white collar alternatives for a career that there’s this overwhelming doom and gloom narrative. High applicant pool causing requirements for consideration to rise, pay not commensurate with job responsibilities, essentially a prime employers market with desperate qualified candidates at their disposal. \n\nWith all this noise, it’s hard to know what’s actually true and with this level of uncertainty about the future it's starting really feel like it doesn't matter what you go for anymore. \n\nWhat advice would you give to help someone navigating these turbulent waters?",

        "author": "Redgeraraged",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was reflecting on [u/SnooTangerines9703](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooTangerines9703/)'s [post on building startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kq8hq3/fk_it_lets_build_startups/). It's something that’s been on my mind for a while. I used to think it was too tedious or far-fetched, but lately, desperation and a deep hunger to make something real have completely overridden that imposter syndrome I carried. Reading their post was like hearing my own thoughts said out loud made me hyperfocus on it.\n\nSo here’s what I’m proposing (and may even build myself if I get enough support behind me):\n\n**One group. One community.**  \nLet’s stop being divided and conquered in a dog-eat-dog grind. Let’s build *together*. Learn together. Grow together.\n\nThe idea is to start a community, on Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, wherever there's traction where anyone who's serious about learning and building can join. No gatekeeping, just mutual accountability.\n\n**How it would work:**\n\n* Each member logs their learning journey with a start and end date, plus their chosen path (e.g. [`MOOC.fi`](http://MOOC.fi) `Java => Java Internship (3 months) & Java II (3 months)`, `Harvard CS50 => (3 months) => w: Web Dev Internship, ai: AI Internship`, etc.).\n* Proof of completion is required (certs, GitHub commits, demo videos). This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth**\n* Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday\n* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)\n* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.\n* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. \n* After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.\n\n# The exposure strategy:\n\nOnce a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. \n\nEach person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.\n\nLet’s be real:  \nMost of us are **introverts**.  \nSome of us are **highly skilled**.  \nAnd many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.\n\nThis isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**.  \nWe need a system that clears the dust off our shine.  \nMany of us are grasping at straws.  \n**Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**\n\n# Long-term vision:\n\n* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.\n* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.\n* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.\n\n# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):\n\n1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** \n   * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc.\n   * \\~6 months total (self-paced)\n   * Initial project (\\~1 month)\n   * Career development + feedback\n2. **Entry-Level Phase**\n   * 3 to 12 projects built with team\n   * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof\n   * Lasts 6 to 12 months\n3. **Junior Phase**\n   * \\~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing\n   * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunities\n\nIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.\n\nI may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone.  \nIf you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**. Please share this with anyone you think may benefit from this style of rigor, discipline and community.\n\nLet's stop moping and wallowing away our best years in self pity.\n\nLet’s stop waiting for experience and start **building it**.",

But the more I think about the future of software development, especially with the rise of AI, the more I believe infrastructure will play a critical role. As computing demands grow, infrastructure will only become more essential. It also feels like one of the areas less likely to be fully automated, since it’s more niche and requires a strong architectural understanding of real customer use cases and context.\n\nSo, what do you people think?

But lately, even those have dried up, despite leveling up my skills. Eight months ago, I had a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, along with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. Since then, I’ve added multi-cloud experience, DevOps, and AI concepts like RAG.\n\nVery rarely I’d gone through complete interview processes: submissions, interviews, take-homes, technical rounds, only to get ghosted or declined. One company was at least honest and told me I needed another year of experience, and that their policy prevented them from hiring me.\n\nI recently got into a strong Master’s program. I should feel excited, but I’m honestly not sure if it’s worth it anymore. I’m even thinking of turning it down because I don’t know if it’ll actually change anything.\n\nIf anyone knows of any solid job resources in NYC or nearby, please share. It's a major metropolitan hub, so there should be something. At this point, I’m not picky. It’s frustrating to think I had better opportunities in CS related roles (with better pay too!) when I was in high school than I do now, right as I’m graduating college and possibly heading into grad school.\n\n**TLDR:** I’m completely lost and looking for help or direction.",

I hear the opposite input...people say salary is comparable, or even sometimes higher.[ Even people mentioning not to go to Canada.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1gs3itq/moving_to_canada_to_work_for_a_more_interesting/)\n\nI am confused basically haha\n\nI notice the tech hubs in EU are  UK, Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, Ireland, Denmark.\n\nQ1) Has anyone worked at the countries above?  how is  the take-home compared to Canada? All else being the same, Im honestly planning to just migrate there just for the public infrastructure  + WLB lol.\n\nQ2) I researched the pros and cons, but Im having trouble pulling the trigger, what factors would convince you to move?  The biggest hurdle for me would to get a working visa, but it looks like companies don't really care if you speak English only. I'm unsure about Canada's future right now hence Im eyeing around other countries lol.",

It had a higher salary and seemed better on paper, company B has a new grad training program but a lower salary. I chose company A and I’m on my 4th day here and my whole team is Indian and while they seem nice, there are a lot of contractors and I’m worried about being excluded and not being able to learn. I rescinded my offer with company B on monday. Could I renegotiate with company B perhaps to work there instead? I’ve heard bad things about all indian teams and i didn’t realize I would be the only white person.  Not trying to be racist but the company advocates diversity",

Now I'm looking for work and I'm considering trying to get a degree in something from a legit college, but I'm not sure how hard it is to find an entry level job period, let alone find an entry level job at 50 in the tech field.\n\nThe school I'm considering will count the degree I have toward the common core stuff, so basically I'd need just the classes specific to my major. Is it worth spending the money on or am I better off hoping to catch on to some random job that doesn't require a relevant degree?\n\n  \nETA:\n\nThanks to everyone who provided constructive and helpful feedback. To answer some questions: No, CS isn't my dream. I had an interest and aptitude for it when I was young, but I really don't care about it anymore. This is just a terrible job market and I'm trying to find some way to improve my resume in the hopes of finding a halfway decent job, like lots of people.\n\nSo why CS? because believe or not, it keeps getting recommended by people as a \"good field for career changers and older workers.\" Even the silly aptitude test thing they make new students take at the University recommends it and frankly, my impression of the tech field has always been that it's crowded, being heavily outsourced and potentially negatively impacted by AI in the same way my old profession as a writer has been. So, the point of this post was to find out from people who actually work in the field if my impression was wrong and all the people recommending it are right or full of shit. Seems the consensus is that my impression was right and I should look at other options.",

        "content": "Seeking some advice… \n\nIn March 2023, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science from a UC in Southern California after returning to school following a break in 2019. While in college, I completed an internship at a local tech company doing software engineering and also picked up some freelance web development work.\n\n\n\nAfter graduation, I spent about five months preparing for technical interviews and applying for jobs. Unfortunately, I drained my limited savings during that time and didn’t land any offers. I eventually stepped away from the job search, partly due to frustration and loss of professional motivation and because I really needed money quickly.\n\n\n\nSince then, I’ve been working at an organics grocery store (the rain forest one) for the past year and eight months. I currently make $18.67 per hour, working 30 to 35 hours a week. I’ve recently been offered a leadership-track role that would bump my pay to around $21.50 per hour with a 40-hour workweek. Still, I’m not happy with my financial situation or this job.\n\n\n\nDespite working in retail, I continue to code and try to learn software engineering topics on my days off or when I have the energy after work. That said, it has been difficult to maintain momentum, and I feel like I’ve lost touch with many of the CS fundamentals needed in the field.\n\n\n\nPart of me regrets not going all in on the job search earlier and settling for a grocery store job. Another part of me is grateful for the soft skills I’ve developed in the meantime.\n\n\n\nNow, I want to pivot back into tech and become a software engineer. At this point, I’d take almost any role in the field just to gain experience and start building a network. I know the job hunt will require time, discipline, and financial commitment. Preparing through LeetCode, system design, and personal projects is going to be time consuming, but it’s necessary. I am rusty on a lot topics. That said, reading about the current job market has me feeling anxious.\n\nI’m at a crossroads and feel completely lost. My options are:\n\n1. **Stay in my current role**, working 30–35 hours per week. Continue saving and use my days off or evenings to focus on technical prep (LeetCode and NeetCode). Once I feel ready, start applying.\n\n2. **Accept the leadership position**, work full-time for six months, and save aggressively. This will net me roughly $20,000 in savings considering holiday pay and OT. After that, step back to part-time (I’m able to work from 4 to 24 hours a week) and use my savings to support myself while focusing full-time on interview prep and project work. \n\nI know I made mistakes and as a result I feel so behind on EVERYTHING. Am I about to make another mistake?\n\n",

I have some regrets now taking this job and not just staying at my last one.\n\nI'm looking at new positions, specifically trying to leave what I don't like about this current job.\n\nBut I have this fear in my mind like, what if every job just sucks? These positions I've interviewed for have sounded really interesting...but so did this 3rd job to some degree.\n\nSo idk, hopping to a 4th job really salary and pay isn't what I care about. I just want to not be bored.\n\nAnyone have insight on it or thoughts about job hopping to not be bored?",

Doing it live, in 15 minutes, while explaining what I’m thinking, with 3 other engineers watching over me though? Feels like a 30 IQ debuff at the very least.\n\nIt’s honestly like language processing and logical reasoning exist on separate threads, in different languages in my brain. So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly. But also keep enough reference of the logic to have something to return to once I explain a point. \n\nThe result is both threads are interrupted frequently and produce incoherent responses. On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.\n\nThat’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better? Is it just a matter of more exposure? This feels insurmountable since I’ve always been this way. Top of math class, but teacher asks me to walk through a solution on the whiteboard?

My situation is complicated, and I don’t want to come across as someone who quits easily.\n\nMy first job was a six-month contract that didn’t get renewed—not because of my performance, but because the deputy director informed all contract staff that we would be \"released to the market on our knowledge.\" I worked around the clock to deliver my assignments, but there was nothing I could do to secure a renewal.\n\nAfraid that I wouldn’t find another opportunity quickly, I accepted my next offer without much hesitation—only to discover that the company had almost no real software development expertise. The local team was constantly misled by overseas developers, and the leadership, despite lacking technical knowledge, refused to acknowledge the gaps. It was like watching The Emperor’s New Clothes play out in real life.\n\nTo make matters worse, my new team lead in the last government linked company sabotaged me. After completing my assignments and demonstrating my work to the project manager and team lead, he withheld key information from the project director. He told her that I didn’t know how to import libraries—but he didn’t mention that I had already finished the task successfully. Because the project director lacked technical expertise, she dismissed me based on that remark.\n\nAdditionally, I had assumed that a \"senior software engineer\" in the team before i joined the new team would have solid technical knowledge. Instead, she was actually a business analyst, and actively made my life difficulty by constantly given me wrong infor that I need to point out to her. They actually insisted the correct way of pushing your code up is git diff.\n\nGiven all of this, how should I explain my work history in interviews? I don’t want to sound like I’m badmouthing past employers, but I also don’t want to be vague and appear like someone who simply couldn’t handle the roles. How do I frame my experiences in a way that is honest, yet professional?\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

This would mean missing a full year of classes, as I’m currently studying abroad spring semester this year. I’ll still graduate on time, but it will be difficult, and it’s unfortunate to lose a year of the college experience when I have the rest of my life to work in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, I could reject the offer and work at a startup over the summer. While the experience would still be valuable, the startup is in Spain, so unlikely I could work there after I graduate. Additionally, Amazon carries more weight in terms of future recruitment. But I could complete my senior year at my university and have a manageable schedule.\n\nI’m leaning toward rejecting the offer since I don’t want to miss another semester of college, but at the same time, I feel like I’d be giving up a valuable opportunity.\n\nAny guidance from people working in software would be super helpful.
