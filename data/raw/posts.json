Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built¬†[ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.\n\n# So, how does it work?\n\nToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.\n\n# Connects to¬†everything\n\n* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!\n* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.\n* Any¬†API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even¬†internal APIs)\n\n# Why you'll love it\n\n* **Zero configuration:**¬†Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.\n* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g.\n   * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`\n* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!\n\n**Docs:**¬†[https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)\n\n**GitHub Repo**:¬†[https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)\n\nA ‚≠ê on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

The size of the data my old lab worked with was small but with the small amount of data I had access to I was able to build some simple python dashboards and automate processes for the lab. I also spent a lot of time in that job learning SQL on the side. The python and SQL experience from my previous job allowed me to transition to my current job. \n\nI have been in my current job for two years. I am starting to think about the next step. The problem I am having is when I search for DA jobs in my area that fit my experience, I don't see a lot of jobs that offer salaries better than what I currently make. I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. \n\nI feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part. And *unlike* my previous job where I was able to teach myself python and implement it on the job, therefore having experience I could put on job applications, there aren't the same opportunities here. Or at least, I don't see how I can make those opportunities. Our data isn't in the cloud. We have a contracting company who handles the backend of our DB. We don't have a DE like team in house. I don't have access to a lot of modern DE tools at work. I can't even install them on my work PC. \n\nA lot of the work would have to be done at home, during my free time, in the form of personal projects. I wonder, are personal projects enough nowadays?

The goal is to provide a central place for analysts and other stakeholders to access and work with reports and data.\n\nFabric looks promising as an all-in-one solution, but we‚Äôve run into a challenge: many of the features are still marked as Preview, and in some cases they don‚Äôt work as reliably as we‚Äôd like.\n\nThat got us thinking: should we fully commit to Fabric, or consider switching parts of the stack to open source projects? With open source, we‚Äôd likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:\n\n‚Å†- flexible server scaling based on demand\n- potentially lower costs\n- more flexibility in how we handle different workloads\n\nOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be super helpful as we‚Äôre evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",

The constant context-switching to answer simple questions for marketing, sales, or product folks was a huge drain on my productivity.\n\nSo, I started working on a side project to see if I could build a better way. The result is something I'm calling DBdash.\n\nThe idea is simple: it‚Äôs a tool that lets you (or your less-technical stakeholders) ask questions in plain English, and it returns a verified answer, a chart, and just as importantly, the exact SQL query it ran.\n\nMy biggest priority was building something that engineers could actually trust. There are no black boxes here. You can audit the SQL for every single query to confirm the logic. The goal isn't to replace analysts or engineers, but to handle that first layer of simple, repetitive questions and free us up for more complex work.\n\nIt connects directly to your database (Postgres and MySQL supported for now) and is designed to be set up in a few minutes. Your data stays in your warehouse.\n\nI'm getting close to a wider launch and would love to get some honest, direct feedback from the pros in this community.\n\n\\*   Does this seem like a tool that would actually solve a problem for you?  \n\\*   What are the immediate red flags or potential security concerns that come to mind?  \n\\*   What features would be an absolute must-have for you to consider trying it?\n\nYou can check out the landing page here: [https://dbdash.app](https://dbdash.app)\n\nIt's still in early access, but I'm really keen to hear what this community thinks.

The challenge is that my analytical, direct approach is what made me good at the technical work, but it's not translating well to the business side.\n\nI've tried some of the usual suspects (Toastmasters, generic communication courses) but they all feel like they're designed for sales people or public speakers, not engineers. The advice is either shallow (e.g. pace, filler words) or in theory (e.g. DISC framework) which doesn't really help when your brain is wired to solve problems efficiently.\n\n**For those who've successfully made this transition - what actually moved the needle for you?**¬†Looking for practical advice, not just \"practice more.\"\n\nAlso, I'm working on something specifically for technical professionals facing this challenge. If you've been through this struggle, would you mind sharing your experience in a quick 8-question assessment?

I‚Äôve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what¬†[r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/)¬†thinks.\n\nThe basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:\n\n1. Download and extract bill data from¬†[Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/)¬†bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here\n2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS\n3. In parallel, extract member data from¬†[Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/)¬†API, concatenate, upload to GCS\n4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt\n5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.\n\nA few observations / questions that came to mind:\n\n\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\n\n\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\n\n\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I‚Äôm not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it‚Äôs applicable to my day job.\n\nThank you if you‚Äôve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I‚Äôve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

Raw (Bronze): Source data and simple views like renaming, parsing, casting columns.\n2. Staging (Bronze): Further cleaned datasets. I often end up finding that there needs to be a lot of additional work done on top of source data, such as joining tables together, building out incremental models on top of the source data, filtering out bad data, etc. It's still ultimately viewing the source data, but can have significantly more logic than just the raw layer.\n3. Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).\n4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific. This is usually something like aggregated, unioned, denormalized datasets.\n\nOverall folder structure might be something like this:\n\n* raw\n   * source\\_A\n   * source\\_B\n* staging\n   * source\\_A\n   * source\\_B\n   * intermediate\n* catalog\n   * business\\_domain\\_1\n   * business\\_domain\\_2\n   * intermediate\n* reporting\n   * report\\_X\n   * report\\_Y\n   * intermediate\n\nHistorically, the raw layer above was our staging layer, the staging layer above was an intermediate layer, and all intermediate steps were done in the same intermediate folder, which I feel has become unnecessarily tangled as we've scaled up.",

I believe this tool/webapp can be useful for data engineering devs and teams. I am looking for the communities feedback. To be honest, I have never shared any of my work publicly and I'm a bit nervous.\n\nSo, the way PulseHook works is I have setup an api end point you can use to post from any of your scripts/jobs. You can send success and error status to this API endpoint. Also, you can setup the monitoring on the web app and enter email(s) and/or slack web hooks for notifications. If the api receives a failure status or job doesn't run in the intended duration, notification would be send to email(s) and/or slack. \n\nSo, here is the webapp link -¬†[https://www.pulsehook.app/](https://www.pulsehook.app/)¬†.

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first).\n\n  \nIn the above case, \n\n1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).\n\n2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.\n\nI want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -\n\n1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).\n\n2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).\n\nI would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).\n\n  \nThank you for reading.",

        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).\n\nNow that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.\n\n### What I liked about Pulsar:\n\n* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.\n* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.\n* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).\n\n### What's painful about Pulsar:\n\n* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant\n* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication\n* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debug\n\nWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. \n\nP.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.\n",

I wanted to share it here to get feedback, especially from any data engineers working in the healthcare, public health, or healthtech space.\n\nThe gist of the project is that it's a Dockerized pipeline that produces synthetic HL7 messages and then passes the data through a series of steps including ingestion, quality assurance checks, and conversion to FHIR. Everything is monitored and tracked with Prometheus and displayed with Grafana. Kafka is used as the message queue, and MinIO is used to replicate an S3 bucket.\n\nIf you're the type of person that likes digging around in code, you can check the project out [here](https://github.com/bryanbritten/hl7-integration).\n\nIf you're the type of person that would rather watch a video overview, you can check that out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3de54014865b4cb7aa59b87ec940626d?sid=271f23fd-7ade-4f82-864f-e2a288a96a36).\n\nI'd love to get feedback on what I'm getting right and what I could include to better represent my capacity for working as a Data Integration Engineer in healthcare. I am already planning to extend the segments and message types that are generated, and will be adding a terminology server (another Docker service) to facilitate working with LOINC, SNOMED, and IDC-10 values.\n\nThanks in advance for checking my project out!",

And it has been 1y I have been promoted as data platform technical lead on a managed data platform dedicated mainly to industry and oil and gas. I like the role since I get to design, architect and build data products that are really bringing value to the business. I learnt that our company are signing a big contract with this data platform technology. This means more opportunity will be available for me inside the company. And I might transition to other projects after that the current project passes to the run phase. It is honestly exciting however I‚Äôm afraid to get locked to this technologie that it is again very niche and technologically speaking less sophisticated than other data platforms like Databricks. It does not yet incorporate lakehouse philosophie/ tools/ data formats for example. The one I‚Äôm working on it is more or less a managed spark cluster with many managed niche industry data source connectors.\nAlso, we are early adopters of this data platform but it has been showing a consistent growth signs, for example Aramco is investing on them and is starting to be used by big oil and gas actors.\n\nI want to get your opinion on this situation, and whether you encountered a similar one and what did you do? do you think it‚Äôs a good thing to continue working and growing inside my company around this niche data platform or should I get more closer to databricks projects (my company is a big one and some projects are using databricks but much smaller projects with less impact )\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

We can ask for more storage via IT tickets, add compression and look into partitioning for performance. But none of those will really solve the issue in the long term.\n\nI‚Äôm wondering a couple of different things here:\n\n1) Does something like Hadoop need to be considered? Is a sql rdms the best opinion for data of this size on-prem?\n\n2) What learning resources to you recommend for understanding how to navigate this kind of thing? The all knowing gpt keeps suggesting designing data intensive applications and the data warehouse toolkit, both of which I have and neither really touches on this.\n\nAnyway, thanks to any on-prem homies who know the struggle and have advice.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new to data lakes and I'm facing a challenge with data replication.\n\nI've set up a data lake on AWS using S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL, and Athena for queries. I'm using AWS DMS to replicate data from an on-premises Oracle database to S3.\n\nThe problem is with **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. DMS pulls all events from the archived redo logs, including inserts, updates, and deletes. This means my Parquet files in S3 have an `op` column that indicates the type of operation (`I`, `U`, `D`).\n\nFor example, if I query my Oracle database for a specific order with ID `123`, I get a single record. But in Athena, I might get up to 30 records for that same order ID because it was updated many times. Worse, if a record is deleted in Oracle, it still exists in my Athena table, maybe with multiple update records and a final delete record.\n\nEssentially, my Athena table is a log of **events**, not the current **state** of the data.\n\nI've found a temporary fix by adding timestamp and SCN (System Change Number) columns, which lets me write complex queries to find the most recent state. But these queries are huge and cumbersome compared to simple queries in Oracle.\n\nI need a better solution for \"sanitizing\" the data. Parquet files are not designed for easy record deletion. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for this.\n\nHow do you guys handle this?\n\n* Do you just accept the complex queries and leave the old records in S3?\n* Do you run a separate process, maybe an AWS Lambda function, to act as a \"garbage collector\" and delete the older records directly from S3?\n* Do you handle this directly in your ETL jobs (e.g., in AWS Glue)?

The table is created but no data is inserted.\n\n\n\nBoth my personal account and the SPN have the same OneLake read access assigned.\n\nSo far it looks like a permissions / tenant setting issue, but I‚Äôm not sure which toggle or role is missing for the service principal.\n\nHas anyone run into this mismatch where OPENROWSET works interactively but not via service principals in pipelines? Any guidance on the required Fabric tenant settings or item-level permissions would be hugely appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

This is my first time trying to do something like this so I'm honestly lost on what I should be doing.\n\nIf you‚Äôve solved this problem before, I‚Äôd love to hear:\n\n* Which tables/fields you leaned on\n* How you handle attribution and refunds\n* Any pitfalls you ran into with Fivetran‚Äôs schema\n* Or even SQL snippets I could copy\n\nNote: This is a small time project I'm not looking to hire anyone to do",

My supervisor only knew about WordPress styling and the others were working in a completely different sector. I had applied too late for internships and didn‚Äôt want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.\n\nThe supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.\n\nNow I‚Äôm studying a higher level degree in the same field. It‚Äôs something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.\n\nThere is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.\n\nAI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.\n\nLong story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it‚Äôs been doing good. It‚Äôs like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself. That's also why I chose this path.\n",

It takes so much time for my mind to come up with a design that is satisfying to me and clear enough that i can start implementing.\n\nSo my question is: Do some of you who are more experienced have tips, tricks, anything that might help reduce that massive waste of time (thats what it feels like)? I guess what would help is to somehow write this stuff down or visualiize it with something like the Obsidian app, but i have no idea how to do this without wasting even more time.",

The issue is‚Ä¶ programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.\n\nMy very first programming course happened only after I got  into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck ‚Äî partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: ‚ÄúI failed this once, I‚Äôll fail it again.‚Äù Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.\n\nI actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.\n\nI‚Äôve seen the advice ‚Äúpick a project idea and use it to learn,‚Äù but I‚Äôve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it‚Äôs useless to jump into projects if you‚Äôre still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.\n\nSo I‚Äôm not really looking for project ideas right now ‚Äî more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I‚Äôm really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo much of a bio/med‚Äù to ever be good at programming.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever been stuck in a similar way, I‚Äôd also love to hear your stories ‚Äî what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.\n\nIt feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors ‚Äî after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I‚Äôm just stuck and don‚Äôt want to waste another year circling the same fear.",

Albeit a very dumb mistake, I have realized my stupidity and am trying to fix it this semester even though I am very panicked about what I did costing me. Instead of taking advanced Java and setting myself up to cheating again, im jumping over to C++ which is another required course while also  taking a seperate course through online to actually learn Java. \n\nThat being said, what can I do to help myself with c++ as I've heard it's a pretty unforgiving and complicated language. When I did research on reddit, I saw a top comment say that you should learn computer programming first, then the languages are just different syntaxes. He recommended the book \"think python, how to think like a computer scientist\", but how else can I really grasp this concept of computer programming. Or if you have completely separate advice id love to hear that as well.\n\nSincerely, a panicked college student. ",

When it comes to learning things which interest me, im all in the project and can do, but when i try game dev i just quickly lost interest, i know its contradicting. In one hand i want to do game dev but in other i kinda dont. I love programming, its my first hobby that im interested and im kinda holding on it for my dear life. Maybe anyone have dealt with such thing before? Maybe anyone got advice how to elevate myself as a programmer? ",

Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it‚Äôs simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.\n\nThere are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, there‚Äôs the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they‚Äôll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?\n\nThe answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.\n\nSo, the debate is not just ‚ÄúWhich language is best?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúWhat matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?‚Äù",

Like Asmon levels of gaming before I enlisted, 18-20 hours a day until I was 23, then I enlisted, got honorably discharged under medical conditions two years ago because of ankle injury (complete fhl and fdl tear and retear) Last year, I fired up the GI bill and got back into school to support my family.¬†\n\nI am currently living in Dallas, Tx. And i‚Äôm going to Dallas College. I am not strong algebraically. This semester, I switched my degree plan from[ AS.Science](http://as.science) (General Studies here in Texas) to the Bachelor's of Applied Technology in Software Development program. My current GPA is good, I am around a 3.2 and I study hard.  \n  \nCurrently unemployed and living off of my disability and GI bill, I am also doing under the table work, cleaning apartments with the abuelas (ICE might put us out of business). I‚Äôd much prefer to do something else lol.\n\nI legit struggle to do some daily activities because of this bum leg but we are thuggin' it out for now. I was wondering if doing things like customer service IT, help me on a resume with Programming related work or am I just wasting my time? It‚Äôs just supplemental income at the end of the day.\n\nI‚Äôm currently taking Programming Logic and Design, Mobile Applications and Development, Intro to Python Programming, and ITSE - Web Design Tools.   \n  \nHonestly, I am just looking for any pointers from anyone who may have been in the same boat at some point. I am stressed. Seeking some form of employment within the industry in the future, I just don‚Äôt know where to start. I would plug ports in some dudes basements for a modest wage for the next 15 aslong as it‚Äôs taxable, ngl.\n\nTL;DR: Is there some general beginner level stuff I can start doing that will benefit me? I know in the future there is hackerrack, leetcode, tryhackme etc. I‚Äôm nowhere near that. We are doing Atomic Kotlin in my classes and only going two sections deep this semester. Anything is appreciated.",

I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. \n\nThe protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. \n\nThey wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.\n\nI spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.\n\nWith that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. \n\nMy experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. \n\nI talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: \n\n\"What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?\"\n\nThey even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently \"Eclipse IDE\". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. \n\nAll this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. \n\nI'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock. The protect is in docker containers that I've been trying to get to work for 3 days to no success.\n\nIs this something I should worry about? And is there anything I can do to actually learn things? \n\nI genuinely feel like I should start the career all over again",

        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.\n\nThis is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.\n\nThere's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.\n\nI think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nSo many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.\n\nI can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I‚Äôd also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I‚Äôd ever stand out in any way.\n\nWhat surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.\n\nThat shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.\n\nI know it‚Äôs tough because ‚Äújust do more tickets‚Äù feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.\n\nCurious if anyone else has felt the same? Do you feel like you‚Äôre in the grind stage, or have you found other ways to break out of burnout?",

        "content": "I work at a tech company in London, UK, and we recently opened up a junior developer position, which we posted online. Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.\n\nThis really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there‚Äôs a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it‚Äôs unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.\n\nIf you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.\n\n**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\n\n\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\n\n\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\n\n\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\n\n\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\n\n\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\n\n\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\n\n\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between ¬£30k to ¬£40k.\n\n\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\n\n\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company‚Äôs internal recruitment information on the internet.\n\n\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\n\n\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

A good honest attitude, curiosity, team orientated and leadership experience is very desirable. Add resume items that demonstrate this, not just say it.\n2. Hiring managers are looking for passion and self learners. Show evidence, not just say it.\n3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.\n4. Take contract work to build experience\n5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.\n6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the  organization used that to assess you.\n7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals\n8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.\n9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.\n10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience\n11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.\n12. The market is so tight that experienced devs available and preferred.\n13. Its a numbers game. Most candidates are similar. So just apply a lot and wish for luck!\n14. Apply as close to the posting of the job as possible. Those are considered first.\n15. Know the company well at interview time \n16. Chances are better at smaller companies.\n17. Resumes get 8 secs of attention. Nobody will look at GitHubs. Nobody looks at cover letters. Hiring managers are short on time.",

        "content": "Almost about to graduate and am currently majoring in Computer Science right now, not because I love it or anything but mainly because at the time it just seemed like the wisest major and a good \"backup\" job. As I go through my classes though I'm finding a hard time with getting the motivation to actually code. I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.\n\nMaybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.\n\nSo I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you? At what point do you just shift to something else?",

I also was a member of student association, organizing couple hundred+ events. I mostly worked part time (20h/week). During my 2 years of work. I moved to a team for half a year... and I did not fit. It was a really stressful period during work. Up to that point I felt I was good. After that I felt I had a lot of flaws and was not good. Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.\n\nAnd right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).\n\nSo I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...\n\nI am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.\n\nLately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.\n\nI was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern). It looked like should not work. I wanted to discuss with another colleague... After 10min of the call, I spent another hour to debug the code and check how it functions via tests. It worked well. Messaged the MID dev and I felt I wasted his time.\n\nThese questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...\n\nI just feel I do not get enough work done, I feel somewhat unmotivated and I feel I waste people's time... Now sure how to systematically fix it.",

My ideal route would be to complete my bachelors with a specialization in ML and then get a masters in ML. It‚Äôs a field I have been interested in since I can remember but I‚Äôm having doubts as to the career prospects both out of my bachelors and after my masters. \n\nThe Canadian job bank in my area has categorized CS as having a ‚Äúgood‚Äù job outlook meaning there‚Äôs expected growth in the market. I also checked the statistics for CS in California and I was met with a similar outlook despite everything online saying the market is oversaturated and to pivot while you still can. Is this just anecdotal vs statistical evidence or is there something of note there?\n\nIt would suck to give up on CS as I genuinely enjoy it but would it be wise to pivot into something else while I still can? If so what would have good prospects? If I continue with CS how would I go about breaking into the industry with a seemingly disappearing entry point? Are internships my only hope?\n\nCS has kind of been my only plan as it‚Äôs what my father does and what I‚Äôve grown up around.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It's been a few months since I graduated and it feels like my job prospects are sharply going down over time. Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.\n\nThe projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any \"real\" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it \"right\" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)\n\nI just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).\n\nI don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",

The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù to speed up development. Usually they‚Äôre hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other‚Äôs toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people‚Äôs work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.\n\nOn top of that, there‚Äôs never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or ‚Äúneeds to be deployed ASAP.‚Äù We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it‚Äôs not a toy project.\n\nMy concern is that after 7 years, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds. For context, I‚Äôm a full stack developer with 14 years' experience.\n\nIs this normal? Or am I just stuck in a dysfunctional setup that‚Äôs holding me back?",

        "content": "tl;dr: [This](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) is the project. The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).\n\nI've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.\n\n* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).\n* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).\n* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).\n* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).\n* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.\n* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.\n\nSo all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**\n\nA lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.\n\nThe project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.\n\nThe problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's \"in Japanese\" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.\n\nI am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about.

I settled for a lower salary initially to get my foot in the door, but raises are coming few and far between. \n\nNow that I have a couple years under my belt, I've been looking around for other positions, but am struggling to be noticed. Sent about 70 applications to no follow-ups so far. Because of this I'm considering doing part time grad school alongside work to become a more competitive candidate, given the rise of AI and the tightening job market. It would be a squeeze money-wise but doable, I think. Is this a good idea? From your experiences, it worth it these days career-wise to pursue a master's degree? Or is it enough to keep building more experience? Do I just need to send more applications out? I'm not sure what the move is from here and wanted to hear from others in the know. Thanks!",

Sometimes deeming those non-urgent tasks as urgent.\n\n3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.\n\n4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.\n\n5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.\n\n6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.\n\n6. Makes decisions very fast without much information at all. This includes creating new meetings, cancelling meetings, creating new outings, letting people off early then asking them to stay for an adhoc meeting, etc.\n\n7. Reassigns work between different team members, also without much information or thought.\n\n8. Seems to be completely oblivious to how these constant disruptions are impacting members of the team (I and other have brought these up personally, and he denied it).\n\n9. Has a very anxious/ chaotic vibe. \n\nGenerally, he is hard to communicate with, or even get a clear idea of what he wants (or correct his unrealslistic expectation) at any given moment. He feels like a fly buzzing around my ears while I'm just trying to focus and get my work done. \n\nHow would you handle/ work with this manager to get on his good side and do well in the company? I like everything else about my team, so unless he becomes and active danger to my career, switching teams isn't on the table.\n\nI think this is a good potential learning experience to learn how to deal with this type of person.

Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. \n\nI know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, \"Do you know Spring Boot?  Do you know Angular?\"  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  \n\nSo, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. \n\nA bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.\n\nI don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. \n\nSo, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.  \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?

        "content": "1.5 months ago a recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin, and I took a while to reply but ended up having a discovery call with him where he told me about the job, and I was interested so I asked a lot of questions. He then said he'll send an assessment for me to complete and I said I'll do it (this is for a tech job, similar to my current one but it seemed to be a tad better). I had that random burst of inspiration so at the time I was going to do it. However I got busy, work had a lot of tasks for me to do, and I couldn't find the time. He even followed up after the assessment expired 2 weeks later and said to let him know if I'd like it renewed, or no longer interested.\n\nI'm very bad with replying to messages, because I get a lot, and I usually prioritize ones from my immediate circle. I'm also pretty disorganized so I was going to respond, but the days passed by am I didn't. Now it's been 2 weeks and I basically ghosted him, not telling him I'm not interested (I wanted to interview anyway just to see if I could have the option, but I probably wouldn't take it because I got good feedback at work so my confidence in my company is renewed for now).\n\nI feel really bad! Should I message him now, saying I'm so sorry for ghosting and I meant to reply but lost track of time?? I also don't want to be blacklisted from that company and would like the option to resume the recruitment process for this role if things at my job change. ",

So anyways, I‚Äôm trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.\n\nFirstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I‚Äôve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people‚Äôs resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that‚Äôs a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that‚Äôs something worth sharing or if maybe I‚Äôm just not ready yet to be applying to internships.\n\nAlright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I‚Äôve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they‚Äôre not very relevant to cs so I don‚Äôt wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it‚Äôs worth adding? Lmk guys.\n\nThirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help üôÅ.\n\nOk thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",

Regardless of that I feel like its a good idea to start working as soon as possible to not fill a gap.\n\nOffer 1: 70k in a USA International consulting agreement (4k net for 3 months, drops to 3k net in contract). This would be a B2B contract until the office gets setup here, which in their perspective takes 3 months. This would become a hybrid role 1x per week, but its 300km away. Besides, since its a B2B with absolutely no benefits (no insurance, no PTO, no nothing, just a monthly retainer), I would have to open tax activity and terminate my unemployment salary which I have for another 1.5 years (worth 1.3k month) and I will not get it back if they fire me (which they can for whatever reason since this is California based law with 0 rights for me). I feel this is extremely risky as they can just replace me with an offshore for cheap anytime they want, and the glassdoor reviews seem spammed with fake 5 stars, with 1 star comments actually mentioning the CEOs names.\n\nOffer 2: My ex ex company offered 2k net and its a 2x per week hybrid role, 70km away, which is better. They want me to be a tech lead and grab every backoffice and migrate to a modular monolith, with .NET and React. It is a long term contract, I have been in this company for 6 years and I needed 0 technical interviews to get an offer, just a call to my boss and he straight away gave me a contract and all his plans.\n\nI am thinking of accepting offer 2, even though its lower. My plan is to just have a safety zone and invest my free time: keep doing interviews and grind system design (which I now will in this job) and learn kubernetes.\n\nAm I doing the correct thing to play safe and secure, and jump back to something better if it shows up?",

For the past year (exactly 1 year next month) I've been working as Frontend Developer in a super small local company. It's been pretty good and I feel like I've learned a lot. Here's the company setup: my superior/boss is also the only backend developer here (I'm the only Frontend dev) so we work closely together. However, my workload is often determined by the superior's work done (since I can't really do much outside of bug-fixing and optimizations if there's no new features) and for this entire summer it's been close to none.\n\nThis is nice in a sense that I can focus on my personal projects (which I am), but in the back of my mind I'm still worried that I'm stagnating commercially, and I think that especially in these early years of my professional experience I would greatly benefit from mentorship and I could learn a lot from other developers as well. Eventually I would like to climb the ranks etc which is simply not possible here where I currently am...\n\nWhat do you guys think? Start looking to join a big team/company to learn (working in teams, scrum, code-reviews etc) or stay here? Important to note (and a big worry for me), is the fact that my boss is expecting a baby very soon and I know that in that period I basically won't be doing anything again.\n\nAny and all input is appreciated, thank you guys!",
