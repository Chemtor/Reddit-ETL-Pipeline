        "content": "\nHey folks,\n\nSo here's the situation: one of our stakeholders got hyped up after reading some LinkedIn post claiming you can \"magically\" connect your data warehouse to ChatGPT and it’ll just answer business questions, write perfect SQL, and basically replace your analytics team overnight. No demo, just bold claims in a post.\n\nWe tried to set realistic expectations and even did a demo to show how it actually works. Unsurprisingly, when you connect GenAI to tables without any context, metadata, or table descriptions, it spits out bad SQL, hallucinates, and confidently shows completely wrong data.\n\nAnd of course... drum roll... it’s our fault. Because apparently we “can’t do it like that guy on LinkedIn.”\n\nI’m not saying this stuff isn’t possible—it is—but it’s a project. There’s no magic switch. If you want good results, you need to describe your data, inject context, define business logic, set boundaries… not just connect and hope for miracles.\n\nHow do you deal with this kind of crap? When influencers—who clearly don’t understand the tech deeply—start shaping stakeholder expectations more than the actual engineers and data people who’ve been doing this for years?\n\nMaybe I’m just pissed, but this hype wave is exhausting. It's making everything harder for those of us trying to do things right.",

I work sometimes 12+ hours a day including weekends and it feels no matter how hard I play 'catch up' there's still neverending work that I never truly felt caught up. I feel dissapointed honestly, I hoped my current job would help me land somewhere more in the engineering space after working in analytics for so long but my job ultimately makes me feel like I will never be able to escape all the annoyingness that comes with working in analytics or data science in general.\n\nMy ideal job would be another more technical DE role, backend engineering or platform engineering within the same general domain area - I do not have a formal CS background.

But no, unless you superficially used Snowflake for a few years at your past job you're an idiot and can't be trusted.

        "content": "To provide measurable benchmarks, there is a need for standardized tasks and challenges that each participant can perform and solve. While these comparisons may not capture all differences, they offer a useful understanding of performance speed. For this purpose, Coiled / Dask have introduced a challenge where data warehouse engines can benchmark their reading and aggregation performance on a dataset of 1 trillion records. This dataset contains temperature measurement data spread across 100,000 files. The data size is around 2.4TB.\n\n**The challenge**\n\n“Your task is to use any tool(s) you’d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3: s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also generate the data yourself.”\n\n**The Result**\n\nThe Apache Impala community was eager to participate in this challenge. For Impala, the code snippets required are quite straightforward — just a simple SQL query. Behind the scenes, all the parallelism is seamlessly managed by the Impala Query Coordinator and its Executors, allowing complex processes to happen effortlessly in a parallel way.\n\n**Article**\n\nhttps://itnext.io/the-one-trillion-row-challenge-with-apache-impala-aae1487ee451?source=friends_link&sk=eee9cc47880efa379eccb2fdacf57bb2\n\n**Resources**\n\nThe query statements for generating the data and executing the challenge are available at \nhttps://github.com/boroknagyz/impala-1trc",

It doesnt matter if you know how to write a loop in some language or how to define a class or anything similar, you just need to be able to realize when you need to iterate over something or express a concept with specific attributes. You can always just reference the syntax later.\n\nI have taken soo many lessons on these things and they all make sense on that day but days later I forget what each of them mean. However, the concept of doing X in a certain way remains.\n\nAm I weird for being this way?  I often feel discouraged when I have to look up a term that other people are using online. At work it happens a lot less with technical jargon as people often just say what they mean in such case BUT in exchange, there is a huge amount of corporate jargon that is used instead: I don't have the bandwidth to keep up with it all.

This pipeline uses AI agents (orchestrated with LangChain/LangGraph and powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to:\n\n* **Plan** data transformation strategies.\n* **Generate** production-ready PySpark code.\n* **Review** the generated code for quality and correctness.\n* **Execute** transformations across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.\n* Crucially, **self-correct** by revising code and retrying in case of errors.\n\nIt aims for a truly zero-touch, self-healing data flow, with integrated observability via LangSmith.\n\nAs a CS undergrad, this is my first significant venture into building a comprehensive data transformation agent like this. I've learned a ton about integrating LLMs with data platforms.\n\nI'd be incredibly grateful if you seasoned data engineers could check it out. Any feedback on the architecture, agent design patterns, PySpark optimization, scalability considerations, or general best practices would be immensely valuable for me.\n\n**📖 Deep Dive (Article):** [https://medium.com/@codehimanshu24/revolutionizing-etl-an-agentic-medallion-data-pipeline-on-databricks-72d14a94e562](https://medium.com/@codehimanshu24/revolutionizing-etl-an-agentic-medallion-data-pipeline-on-databricks-72d14a94e562)",

        "author": "Miserable-Toe5090",

        "content": "Hey everyone—I could really use some advice.\n\nI’m currently a senior data analyst working in healthcare fraud analytics and model development at a large government contracting firm. Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.\n\nRecently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.\n\nI already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.\n\nThe catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.\nI expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.\n\n⸻\n\nMy question for you all:\n1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?\n2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?\n3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)\n4. If I pass this up, how hard would it be to break into DE externally without prior experience or the DE title?\n\nAny perspective—especially from folks who’ve made the jump or hired junior/mid DEs—would really help. Thanks in advance!",

The goal for this discussion is to understand whether Mongo or Postgres makes the most sense to achieve that. \n\nBackground: It is a containerized microservices application in EKS. Currently uses Oracle, which we’ve been asked to stop using due to license costs. Currently it’s single region but the requirement is to be multi region (US east and west) and support multi master DB.\n\nDetails: Without revealing too much sensitive info, the application is essentially an order management system. Customer makes a purchase, we store the transaction information, which is also accessible to the customer if they wish to check it later. \n\nUser base is 15 million registered users. DB currently had ~87TB worth of data. \n\nThe schema looks like this. It’s very relational. It starts with the Order table which stores the transaction information (customer id, order id, date, payment info, etc). An Order can have one or many Items. Each Item has a Destination Address. Each Item also has a few more one-one and one-many relationships. \n\nMy 2-cents are that switching to Postgres would be easier on the dev side (Oracle to PG isn’t too bad) but would require more effort on that DB side setting up pgactive, Citus, etc. And on the other hand switching to Mongo would be a pain on the dev side but easier on the DB side since the shading and replication feature pretty much come out the box. \n\nI’m not an experienced architect so any help, advice, guidance here would be very much appreciated. \n\n\n",

I assume Data Engineering or Data Science because hiring managers seem to see the word “science” or “engineering” and think it’s the best thing ever.\n\nTLD(id)R; I feel like a dummy because I got my Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems about 2 years ago.

I was reflecting on what else my degree could be useful for, and I did a lot of data analytics and visualization, with a close friend of mine who was a math major just landing a very well paying Analytics job. This genuinely has me thinking of going back for MS in some data-related field.\n\nIf you think this is a good idea, what programs/schools/masters do you recommend?

Can I do it with SQLAlchemy taking a Polars dataframe as an input?\n\nThe complete data pipeline looks like this:\n- read in flat file (xlsx/CSV/JSON) with Polars\n- perform some data wrangling operations with Polars\n- upsert data to SQL Server (with table operation 'Create table if not exists')\n\nWhat I also found in a Stackoverflow post regarding Upserts with Polars:\n\n```\ndf1 = (     df_new     .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"inner\")     .select(df_new.columns) )  df2 = (     df_new     .join(df_old, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") )  df3 = (     df_old     .join(df_new, on = [\"group\",\"id\"], how=\"anti\") )  df_all = pl.concat([df1, df2, df3])\n```\n\nOr with `pl.update()` I could perform an Upsert inside Polars:\n\n```\ndf.update(new_df, left_on=[\"A\"], right_on=[\"C\"], how=\"full\")\n```\n\nWith both options though, I would have to read in the respective table from the database first, perform the Upsert with Polars and then write the output to the database again. This feels like 'overkill' to me?...\n\nAnyways, thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!\n\n",

        "content": "I'm working on a project where I'm building a pipeline to organize, analyze, and visualize experimental data from different batches. The goal is to help my team more easily view and compare historical results through an interactive web app.\n\nRight now, all the experiment data is stored as CSVs in a shared data lake, which allows for access control, only authorized users can view the files. Initially, I thought it’d be better to load everything into a database like PostgreSQL, since structured querying feels cleaner and would make future analytics easier. So I tried adding a batch_id column to each dataset and uploading everything into Postgres to allow for querying and plotting via the web app. But since we don’t have a cloud SQL setup, and loading all the data into a local SQL instance for new user every time felt inefficient, I didn’t go with that approach.\n\nThen I discovered DuckDB, which seemed promising since it’s SQL-based and doesn’t require a server, and I could just keep a database file in the shared folder. But now I’m running into two issues: 1) Streamlit takes a while to connect to DuckDB every time, and 2) the upload/insert process is for some reason troublesome and need to take more time to maintain schema and structure etc.\n\nSo now I’m stuck… in a case like this, is it even worth loading all the CSVs into a database at all? Should I stick with DuckDB/SQL? Or would it be simpler to just use pandas to scan the directory, match file names to the selected batch, and read in only what’s needed? If so, would there be any issues with doing analytics later on? \n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s built a similar visualization pipeline — any advice or thoughts would be super appreciated!",

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL Debezium CDC connectors as of now. As per my understanding, the reason MongoDB and PostgreSQL connectors need the heartbeat mechanism is that both MongoDB and PostgreSQL notify the connector of the changes in the subscribed collections/tables (using MongoDB change streams and PostgreSQL publications) and if no changes happen in the collections/tables for a long time, the connector might not receive any activity corresponding to the subscribed collections/tables. In case of MongoDB, that might lead to losing the token and in case of PostgreSQL, it might lead to the replication slot getting bigger (if there are changes happening to other non-subscribed tables/databases in the cluster).\n\n  \nNow, as far as I understand, MySQL Debezium connector (or any CDC connector) reads the binlog files, filters for the records pertaining to the subscribed table and writes those records to, say, Kafka. MySQL doesn't notify the client (in this case the connector) of changes to the subscribed tables. So the connector shouldn't need a heartbeat. Even if there's no activity in the table, the connector should still read the binlog files, find that there's no activity, write nothing to Kafka and commit till when it has read. Why is the heartbeat mechanism required for MySQL CDC connectors? I am sure there is a gap in my understanding of how MySQL CDC connectors work. It would be great if someone could point out what I am missing.\n\n  \nThanks for reading.",

Also not really sure how experienced they think I am lol\n   * Are they expecting me to learn these technologies beforehand like I am doing?\n* What skills should I absolutely know vs. what I can learn on the fly\n* How to make a good impression when I’m a *lot* less experienced than everyone else\n* How to ask for help without sounding incompetent or annoying them\n* Any specific prep/resources you recommend in the next couple weeks\n* Etiquette in general\n\nAppreciate any advice. I really just want to show up prepared without absolutely wasting the opportunity.",

So I’m confused on what they are and when should we use them. Let’s only consider “new” scenario. Like would you still use MQTT? Or switch over to NATS directly if you were staring from scratch?\n\nAnd then cool that it’s better but why ? Can anyone tell me some use cases for each of them and/or how they can be used or combined to solve an issue ?",

I would like to avoid having to define element1, subelement1, approved, format_x\n\nelement1, subelement2, approved, format_y.\n\nI currently can do this in seeds but what I would like is a kind of CRM that allow me to do relations. So if element1 is approve than that’s something, and I have somewhere else to store all approved subelement for this.\n\nMight be complicate to understand in simple words, but tldr how do you store static things that are required for your pipeline ? I want something else than juste a table in Postgres because I want non tech people to be able to add elements\n\nWe currently use Salesforce for some stuff, but are going away from it so I try to find a simple solution which can work for DE and not necessary the company as a hole. Something simple nothing fancy is required.\n\nThanks",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\n\nHey folks,\n\nWe're currently planning to deploy an on-premise big data cluster using Kubernetes. Our core stack includes MinIO, Apache Spark, probably Trino, some Scheduler for backend/compute as well as Jupyter + some web based SQL UI as front ends.\n\nHere’s where I’m hitting a roadblock: table management, especially as we scale. We're expecting a ton of Delta tables, and I'm unsure how best to track where each table lives and whether it's in Hive, Delta, or Iceberg format.\n\nI was thinking of introducing Hive Metastore (HMS) as a central point of truth for all table definitions, so both analysts and data engineers can rely on it when interacting with Spark. But honestly, the HMS documentation feels pretty thin, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something—or maybe even looking at the wrong solution altogether.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n- How do you manage table definitions and data location metadata in your stack?\n- If you’re using Hive Metastore, how do you handle IAM and access control?\n\nWould really appreciate your insights or battle-tested setups!\n",

        "author": "ves_el",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an electrical engineer with a background in digital IC design, and I've been working on a side project that might interest folks here: a **modular, node-based signal processing app** aimed at engineers, researchers, and audio/digital signal enthusiasts.\n\nThe idea grew out of a modeling challenge I faced while working on a **Sigma-Delta ADC simulation in Python**. Managing feedback loops and simulation steps became increasingly messy with traditional scripting approaches. That frustration sparked the idea: what if I had a visual, modular tool to build and simulate signal processing flows more intuitively?\n\n**The core idea:**\n\nThe app is built around a visual, schematic-style interface – similar in feel to Simulink or LabVIEW – where you can:\n\n* **Input your Python code**, which is automatically transformed into processing nodes\n* **Drag and drop** processing nodes (filters, FFTs, math ops, custom scripts, etc.)\n* **Connect them** into signal flow graphs\n* **Visualize signals** with waveforms, spectrums, spectrograms, etc.\n\nI do have a rough **mockup of the app**, but it still needs a lot of love. Before I go further, I'd love to know if this idea resonates with you. Would a tool like this be useful in your workflow?\n\n**Example of what I meant:**\n\n*example.py*\n\n    def differentiator(input1: int, input2: int) -> int:\n      # ...\n      return out1\n    \n    def integrator(input: int) -> int:\n      # ...\n      return out1\n    \n    def comparator(input: int) -> int:\n      # ...\n      return out1\n    \n    def decimator (input: int, fs: int) -> int:\n      # ...\n      return out1\n\nI import this file into my \"program\" (it's more of an CLI at this point) and get processing node for every function. Something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/VCtF0Bd). And than I can use this processing nodes in [schematics](https://imgur.com/a/x6QIQUM). Once a simulation is complete, you can \"probe\" any wire in the schematic to plot its signal on a graph (Like LTSPice).\n\nLet me know your thoughts — any feedback, suggestions, or dealbreaker features are super welcome!",

Is this feature rock-solid or brittle? Any unexpected limits?\n2. **Pivot + bookmark persistence** – Can an end-user create and save a custom pivot layout as a \"bookmark\" *inside the embed*, without having to go to the main QS console?\n3. **Exports** – We have a hard requirement for both **CSV** and native **.xlsx** exports directly from the embedded dashboard. Are there any hidden row caps or API throttles we should know about?\n4. **SPICE vs. Direct Query** – For a table of this size, does an hourly incremental SPICE refresh work reliably, or is it painful? Any horror stories about Direct Query queueing under heavy concurrent use?\n5. **Row-level security at scale** – What is the community's consensus or best practice? Should we use separate QuickSight namespaces per tenant, or a single namespace with a dynamic RLS rules table?\n\nLinks, gotchas, or clever workarounds—all are welcome. We're a small data-eng crew and really appreciate you sharing your experience!\n\nThank you very much for your time and expertise!",

But the moment I began typing, I blanked out. I couldn’t recall even the basic syntax of JavaScript or Python. I could hear their laughter in my own head, even though no one mocked me directly. It was deeply embarrassing.\n\nIn that moment, I started questioning my skills and every decision that brought me here. I’ve built several projects, some quite complex, like an image size compressor but none of that mattered when I failed to write a basic loop. Maybe it was the nerves, or maybe I just froze under pressure. I’m not entirely sure.\n\nI don’t know if it’s appropriate to share this here, but I felt the need to. This experience shook me.

But sometimes I open a class doc and it just… feels endless. So many properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, mixins, parameters, and I’m like:\n\n\"Wait… what do I actually need to look at right now?\"\n\nI often just search for what I need in the moment, but then I get this weird FOMO (fear of missing out), like maybe I’m ignoring something really useful that I’ll need later.\nAt the same time, reading everything seems impossible and draining.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nHow do you personally approach big documentation pages?\n\nDo you just read what’s relevant now?\n\nDo you take time to explore what else a class can do, even if you don’t need it yet?\n\nAnd if yes, how do you remember or organize what you saw for later?\n\n\nI guess I just feel like I should \"know everything\" and that pressure gets overwhelming. Would love to hear how others deal with this — especially devs who’ve been doing this for a while.\n\nThanks",

I later became tired and fed up with my process that I moved onto another as a break of sorts. Then another. And another. And at this point, I haven’t coded in a while in two weeks or done anything productive. I’ve really just been getting into crochet to take off the pressure about contractual stuff and just focus on something else for the time being like making a sweater I saw from Pinterest for instance..\n\nI have about three projects which are unfinished and I promised myself especially about the portfolio website that I will finish it because I have been working on that since last December. Then again the reason why it took awhile was because of I was trying to figure out and decide what the UI would look just to avoid large frontend revisions. Anyways, any advice for managing projects? I really want to be able to finish these independently and especially at least one of these within the end of the summer. ",

        "content": "I started learning programming last month with the final intention of making my dream game (like every person ever that learns to program). Started with editing (see: copying code into and altering) a 3D character controller state machine for godot, was pretty proud that I got it so that the player couldn't uncrouch underneath something and adapted someone else's code to make a leaning system. Realized the 3D game idea was way way too outside of my skill set so I downgraded to 2D, worked on that a bit, got caught up making screenshot mockups cause I'm an artist, barely really coded anything but figured that this was still too hard for me probably. Tried making pong. Too hard. Finally I just ate my pride and said I'd shed the need of trying to learn to program and learn a game engine at the same time and now I'm making a text adventure game in python.\n\nThe reason I had my first win is cause I've had such a hard time coding anything by myself. I've always needed a tutorial and never come up with solutions on my own. I needed a bit of help to get this project rolling but overall but now I'm able to open up VS Code and work alone with googling and documentation reading. I made a really basic save system on my own! Came up with the problem, thought about it, and came to a solution on my own! It's far from robust or complex, there are probably a million better ways to do this but I did it by myself and I'd say it's reasonably complex considering I was having troubles coding a 2D character controller on my own.\n\nI've got a long way to go but I think this is a good ass win. Time to let my ego get to me and scope creep a choose your own adventure book.",

        "content": "*Im writing this as an all encompassing Praise / Gripe / Warning for others considering the appeal of using* [*Boot.dev*](http://Boot.dev) *to learn about backend dev.*\n\n>**THE PRAISE**\n\nFor learning actual code basics, ie Python / CLI / git, its been fantastic and well worth the money. The courses are very well put together and really make it easy and approachable to pick up and learn the foundational material. The community is exceptionally helpful, the AI tool for education theyve employed is very good at \"teaching\" you concepts without just flat providing the answers (very different from what the other AIs out there do), and you do feel as though you are progressing and learning as you go up in the subject matter.\n\n\n\n>**THE GRIPE**  \n*i say this as someone who did NOT have a coding background*\n\nAs you move along through the courses, especially once you hit the PyGame / Object Oriented Programming / Functional Programming areas, you will start to hit \"concept walls\" where you can't complete the answer just based on the information that's been previously provided. I've hit many moments, where feeling completely stumped on a lesson, that the core solve for it came from an understanding that was not reviewed in the previous \"internal\" materials, but existed as something that would have been \"understood\" if the user had some comp sci / programming background. It's just very frustrating at times to feel as though you've been paying attention to the materials and following along, only to suddenly hit a wall of knowledge and discover, \\[ no its designed to not be informed, so you have an urge to go out and find what you dont know \\]. Personally, if I'm paying for a service, I want the knowledge to be provided for learning, not that I have to go out externally elsewhere and hopefully discover it.  \n\n\n>**THE WARNING**\n\nContent will become SIGNIFICANTLY harder as you progress. The Discord is there and does help a lot in answer basic questions, and some more advanced ones; but it does genuinely feel as though the course materials are being written more for people who are already have familiarity with Comp Sci / Programming, **ie the core basics**, and then the later courses are meant to build on top of that wider external schooling and knowledge.  \n  \nThose that are there to assist, again all well meaning and wanting to be helpful, advise on how to solve for it as if they were speaking to other programmers who also are familiar with the code youre having trouble with. Like hearing 2 experts talk to each other trying to solve a problem, if youre not on the same level knowledge wise, it becomes more difficult to follow along on what theyre trying to advise on how to correct for.  \n\n\n>**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nThe service provided is INCREDIBLY well worth the cost... to a point depending on where you're starting from.  \nIf you have some code formal training / teaching, it probably is easier to follow along, but its openly stated that there is a teaching approach of not providing all the resources / guideposts for you to follow, and that you should go beyond the platform to find some answers.\n\n**For me, I have issue with that approach as a service I'm paying for to learn a subject matter on**  \n*but again, thats uniquely to me*\n\nI just want to share this to both promote the service, as I have been able to write functional python blurbs for solving my own small scale ideas and puzzles; but also as a warning that its VERY unlikely you can go into this, completely cold fresh and blind, and come out within 1 year as a trained backend dev with the full experience. \n\nI'll most likely renew my yearly membership for the platform, but there are hurdles that I now have to figure out the best way to learn-around instead of just beating my face into the wall as I have been for some problems.",

So, I want to ask, is it really?\n\nPython does look easy, but the indentation makes no sense to me and it honestly makes code more difficult to follow for me. I have no experience in Python so I may be VERY wrong. But personally, even though I can understand Python code to a good extent, the indentation just throws me off and makes reading nested code a HEADACHE for me because I have to take a hot second on each line to see where the indentation begins and ends. Now, this could all be because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but isn't the whole point of Python to be easy to read and understand? It is easy to read, I understand most code snippets out there, but the whole indentation thing is just so confusing to me. Is this a normal thing to say? Am I going crazy for questioning Python's readability? I'll still learn it some day, but I just wanted to ask whether anybody has ever felt this way and how they overcame it, because I don't want to get a headache every time I create an API.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I was reading Modern Operating Systems 4th Edition, in section 2.2.4 the author was talking about the cons of ***user space threads*** and near the end said that for CPU-bound applications that rarely block, there is no reason to use threads because it won't be convenient.\n\nHowever, having studied a bit of Graphics Programming, my intuition says that even in such contexes, multithreading can be beneficial if the computation can be divided into multiple computations indipendent from each other (like calculating matrix-vector multiplication for each vertex, or evaluating different nodes in a chess game tree) because each computation will be executed in a different cpu core in parallel.\n\nGranted, this will of course come with the added cost of managing concurrency and whatnot, but is it really that detrimental to the point of claiming that there is no reason?\n\nEdit: yes there is a reason, thank you u/GeorgeFranklyMathnet.\n\n>Right, different *user* threads can't be reliably scheduled to process in parallel on different CPUs. That's (more or less) why we have the very popular rule of thumb in Python: multithreading for I/O-bound work, multiprocessing for CPU-bound work.\n\nAlso thank you to u/HQMorganstern for the more detailed explanation",

Hopefully) has been pushing me to go towards a career i've always had dabbled with in my free time.\n\nI'm just in need for some advice on my best route possible. \n\nI've played around with TrueNAS, linux, and Docker before and i am well aware that these are just trivial things and in no way a reflection as to how difficult coding truly is.\n\nWhat i'd like to ask the community is: What is some advice anyone in the industry could lend me? Should I go to uni and take night classes? Would online certificates land me a good job? If so where should i take them?\n\nI've also been very interested in [Boot.Dev](http://Boot.Dev) \n\nHas anyone been able to land a job with the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) program? if not and i were to sign up for their program, would i be wasting my money by signing up for another online school to pass their accredited courses?\n\nThe reason i'm so interested in [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) is i have ADHD and i never knew about it until my 4th year of trade school. I always had issues with learning by reading. but with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) making it into a game i truly think i could pick up the basics through them.\n\nAnyways, I apologized for ranting. if anyone could lend this old man some knowledge i would be forever indebted!\n\nThanks!!",

I used to look forward to every upload, it felt like a little event each time. Watching the channel grow over the years and gain millions of subscribers has been awesome.\n\nLately though, I’ve noticed that most of the content has been focused on AI, especially in the Code Report series. I totally understand why AI is huge right now, and those videos are pulling crazy numbers. But I kind of miss his older content, like the classic “100 Seconds of (Tech)” videos, the JavaScript survival guide, or Web Dev 101. That kind of content was gold, especially for new and intermediate devs or engineers trying to get a solid grip on different technologies quickly.\n\nIt does seem like Fireship is aware of this he even mentioned in the recent MCP tutorial video that it’s still a tutorial channel. So it’s nice to see that acknowledgment. And to be fair, even his newer videos still have that signature humor and creativity that made his channel stand out in the first place.\n\nOverall, I still really enjoy his channel and respect what he’s doing. It’s been a valuable resource for a lot of programmers, developers, engineers. Fireship has played a big role in making learning tech feel less intimidating and more fun, and that’s something I’ll always appreciate. ",

I searched a bit and I cam across an example that said that flags are just variables that control a loop. Like:\n\n`bool flag = true;`  \n`int loops = 0;`\n\n\n\n`while(flag)`  \n`{`  \n`++loops;`  \n`std::cout << “Current loop is: ” << loops << std::endl;`\n\n`if(loops > 10)`  \n`{`  \n`flag = false;`  \n`}`  \n`}`\n\n  \nIs it all what SDL\\_INIT\\_VIDEO is doing there? Just controling a loop inside the function? Since I can't see the SDL\\_INIT function definition (the documentation doesn't show it), I can only assume that there might be a loop inside it. ",

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.\n\nThere's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice.   \nI want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.\n\nIn 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.\n\nOr maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until  things start to click - just like it was for the first time:)  \n  \nWhat's your view/advice?

Projects are driven by an “XY team” that pushes hard but doesn’t define proper requirements.\n\nQuarterly planning is done via a single PowerPoint slide per project. We’re expected to commit upfront, even without clear specs. When we ask for more definition, they say, “We’re agile, we don’t define things upfront.” Topic owners exist, but they’re not software engineers and handle this work on the side.\n\nI’ve tried to bring structure (requirements engineering, estimations, etc.), but that work isn’t recognized or factored into planning. Only visible UI changes seem to matter. One colleague quit over this, others have told me to consider leaving. I’m trying to push through, but this setup is draining — it’s hard to do good work without burning out.",

I even spent days reading Reddit threads and Quora answers trying to “find the best roadmap.”\n* Guess what? I wasted 3 full months doing just this. Minimal progress. Constant overwhelm. I wasn’t practicing,  I was just researching how to practice.\n* It hit me hard when my senior told me: The best resource is the one you actually stick to.\n* That’s when things changed. I picked one creator whose teaching style I liked. I stopped second-guessing and stuck to their roadmap. Within weeks, I saw more clarity and growth than I had in the past few months.\n* Here’s what I learned: You don’t need 10 resources. Give yourself 1-2 days max to pick a creator/platform. Then stop looking. Start solving. That’s where the growth is.\n* Don’t fall into the trap that the next video or roadmap will finally unlock it. Progress doesn’t come from finding the perfect guide, it comes from showing up and putting in the reps.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, learn from my mistakes. Pick one solid resource. Trust it.

Now I want to know what I need to learn before applying for jobs on upwork?  \nAm I even ready? Do I need to learn more?  \nIs this the right next step? (Sorry if I sound lost… I think I am.)\n\nThanks in advance!",

In the beginning, it really made me interested in math.\n\nIt seems programming youtube channels are more fast paced, tutorial channels, with no real passion. Why don't we have more compsci channels that are similar to how 3blue1brown is for math? I feel like it would inspire deep thinking and learning in new programmers.\n\nIf anyone knows of any, could they send me channels like the ones I am describing?",

I was thinking of learning Python next but again, most of what I want to achieve is with a more rigid language, but at the same time Python can get stuff done FAST because of how simple it is. But... And I don't mean to offend any Pythonistas or Pybros and Pygals, but if I can do all of the things with JS that I can do with Python and also most of what I'll be working with is web-based, then I don't see much point in going with Python YET apart from job opportunities and fast development speeds.\n\nOn the other hand, C# and Go are perfect for what I want. Something similar and simple like JS but are more strict and complex while also having many different techniques to solving problems, like how C# digs deeper into OOP, and Go is great for concurrency and I feel like those are tools that will really help level up my thinking and programming while also giving me the ability to build more complex applications.\n\nSo, I don't know what's best.

Yes, those companies take the same risk hiring those people, so no the interviews we do are not needed.\n\nI don't see this mentality in pretty much any other industry (in b4 reddit comes up with the exception to the rule). \n\nAll this mentality does is enable managers to take advantage of you with almost no benefit to you at all. \n\nCan we please stop with this stupid mentality in this industry? It is out of hand.",

Now a days every role seems like unstable, roles are getting merged or eliminated, you cannot plan your career anymore. You cannot decide if I do X, Y, Z there is a high probability I will land P, Q or R. By the time you graduate P, Q, R roles may not even exist in the same shape anymore. You are trying to catch a moving target, it is super frustrating.\n\nNot only that you cannot build specialized expertise in a technology, it may get automated or outsourced or replaced by a newer technology. We are in a weird position now. I don't think I will advise any 20 year old to target this industry unless they are super intelligent or planning to do PhD or something. \n\nIs my assessment wrong ?

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Let me start by saying I’m (early career) a year into this corporate job at a \"billion-dollar\" multinational company. I fully understand that any work I do while employed is legally the company's intellectual property. That said, this post is more about how I can take advantage of my contributions for my career rather than being brushed aside.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I made an earlier post about a similar situation, but at a smaller scale. Since then, things have escalated quickly, and I feel the new developments warrant a separate post.\n\nLong story short, I modernized an outdated system with great success for our region. It gained a lot of traction so much so that a team from another region requested I build the same system for them, tailored to their needs.\n\nNow here’s where the new developments start. Apparently, while all this was happening, someone higher up at the global level got access to my project and showed it to their boss who is just one level below the CEO. I still have no idea who this person is or how they even gained access to my work. Anyways, this corporate leader was so impressed that they decided the system should be rolled out globally as soon as possible. The person who shared my project then took it upon themselves to assign a team dedicated to replicating it for all regions.\n\n\nNow this assigned team somehow managed to access my project (I genuinely suspect a security breach or admin-level involvement) and tried to reverse-engineer everything I built.. but failed. They then began trying to identify who was behind the project and eventually contacted my manager (the \"official\" project manager) by pulling him into a meeting without prior notice. Odd.\n\nSo my manager then decided to setup a proper call with this team with me involved this time. In this call, they basically came forward and requested us to provide all the code, tools, and infrastructure so they can simply copy and paste it for all regions, as well as requesting several technical sessions. To make matters worse, they want me to handle all the IT bureaucratic processes for every region to get things set up. I can already see myself being roped into supporting all regions and not just my own at this point. Not only that, but I believe this \"replication\" approach will be destined to fail as each region has different user requirements and processes not quite comparable to ours. And I also strongly believe they will struggle to get anything running, due to their limited technical and business knowledge of the processes, and the type of technical questions I was being asked. \n\n\nNevertheless, if this team rolls out my solution globally for each region, they’ll receive all the visibility and credit (they'll be hosting demo sessions with region leaders which for sure I wont be invited to), while I'll be essentially cast into the shadows. What’s frustrating is that I have full knowledge of the system and am responsible for it so why isn't my manager at least being the one leading this global rollout and not some random team?\n\nI’ve been trying to indirectly nudge my manager to take ownership of the global initiative, instead of letting this new team take over. But I’m not sure how this will play out. The person who assigned this team is closer to the corporate leader, while my manager is a few steps lower in the hierarchy. So far, all he’s done is try to keep our regional manager informed of the situation playing out. Realistically, only the regional manager can mention this to the corporate leader, but I’m not confident that will happen.\n\nMy manager often says \"how will this benefit the team?\" But in this case, it’s clear he’s struggling to see any benefit in simply handing over our work to another team that will walk away with all the credit.\n\nWe’re still in the early stages, and I haven’t handed anything over yet. But I’m deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. From a career perspective, it looks like I'm gaining nothing from this besides telling myself I did the work. Being so early in my career, a project like this would really benefit me tenfold. I really don't want to waste this chance to turn this into something beneficial.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who shared their perspective. I recognize that my tone reflected more negativity than I aim to carry as a person. I allowed ego to slip in due to the project's success. Moving forward, I’ll focus on assuming positive intent and professionally advocating for myself when possible as that is the only thing I truly have control over.",

A few things struck to me as red flags -\n\n* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)\n\n* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.\n\n* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.\n\n* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.\n\nThere might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.\n\nAfter spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.\n\nI was given a warning for using my phone for \"non-productive reasons\" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours.

You build screens, hook up APIs, and maybe add some animations or state handling here and there. But when it comes to core business logic, anything that actually requires deeper system thinking or architectural decisions — all of that is almost always at the backend (for good reasons).\n\nAnd honestly, most app devs I’ve worked with don’t even try to go beyond that. Very little interest in performance optimization, state management patterns, or even understanding what happens behind the API. It’s mostly a UI plumbing job.\n\nSo I’m wondering — is this it? Do people just keep doing the same thing for 10–15 years until they’re replaced by younger devs who can do the same job for cheaper? Or is there a natural transition path (into BE, product, or something else) that actually makes sense?\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve been in the app dev track longer or made a pivot.\n",

They’ve pushed out any and all leadership that were a source of any friction at the top, and I think they saw this new leader they hired was gonna validate anything they say. Now it’s only yes-people in the room. Teams and reorgs constantly happen at whims of leadership without really consulting anyone. This then impacts roadmap items but the expectations don’t change. Roadmap itself is never even really committed too, cause they change priorities there all the time, you never know when or why the thing you were working on for three weeks will get deprioritized. You also don’t know when something you thought you’d do a month later you’re now expected to present a prototype of at the end of the week. A lot of expected overtime work, not a lot of pay or advancement opportunity. Definitely a lack of clarity or support on directions given. I’ve seen people ask valid questions get put on PIPs basically. \n\nAs a designer I can definitely say this is not a place I expect to do great work or anything I can really showcase. The top down mandate is quite simply, AI-wash the product. I worked on a project with that mandate, just impossible constraints and no scope clarity. So I had to challenge that team to really turn this into something that customers would value and pay for and set a small target. With the full support and backing of my manager we really pushed to make sure it’s at least providing real value to the user, compromised as quickly as possible when necessary to unblock Eng (we were all building the plane while flying it). We really inserted ourselves so that we don’t make terrible UX decisions even and especially when that made things a little harder. Worked really hard on it, set a bar for quality. Executives swooped in last two weeks before launch and started asking for tons of changes, same timeline. So, lost time QAing there that really would have made a difference. Delayed the launch. They freaked out and blamed everyone they were pushing to work 80 hour weeks for a month to get this done. An eng quit on the spot which I applaud. Sure enough it launched and immediately sold enough to make the company profitable for its first quarter in like two years. Did we get any additional respect or acknowledgement, maybe some trust and respect for our process? lol. Well, that product leader got all the credit somehow despite having very little involvement. They got a promotion, and my manager, the one really backing me up challenging them and the team, got demoted, so no design voice in the leadership room now. This is the same product leader who’s entire staff either quit or been let go since they joined, and a replacement hired for most of them. Despised by everyone in product, design, and eng now. Yet, great at rubbing shoulders with management and pleasing them. Way too small of a company for politics like that to really work, but sure enough they convinced founders that they’re the goat. \n\nThey have multiple engagement surveys where we’ve basically flatlined to zero on product side since that leader started. Feedback has been given calling out leadership as the source. None of the driving behavior changed or was addressed by them, it only got worse. Then Eng started to feel the impact of this over the last 6 months. A lot of them started quitting, the best ones that had been there longest and had most domain knowledge. most recent engagement shows a big dip for them now too. Def cannot replace them faster than they quit right now and it’s an existential risk. It’s looking like the ship is gonna sink itself here. \n\nI’m also just wondering if there’s greener grass or is this just how the industry is gonna be for a while? Business idiots running everything into the ground with zero accountability, and ICs treated like disposable resources who can be replaced by AI if they go. It’s frustrating cause if they actually empowered us a bit more, we have the talent and means of making a great product that actually sells, but it’s like their own egos take priority and they can’t conceive of anyone knowing the business opportunities worth investing in other than themselves. Down to the micromanaged details, like they don’t trust or value the expertise they hired. \n\n",

Lowe's the hardware store. Back in 2021 they were trying to recruit me even though I wasn't in the area. I talked to the same recruiter again couple weeks ago, and she was very dismissive and condescending about me not wanting to relocate to Charlotte North Carolina, and was very adamant about the fact that I would have to drive outside of Charlotte about 20 mi north of the city to Morrisville where the job was located, which is honestly kind of stupid if you ask me?

Technically, I’ve been eligible to graduate for the past year, but I’ve been deliberately delaying it to continue doing internships and gain experience while at the same time applying for full-time jobs. My plan was always to hit the graduation button the moment something landed.\n\nSo far, I’ve racked up **28 months of internship experience**, mostly including software and hardware development at places like Dell Technologies and a space agency. And yet, I’m still struggling to land a full-time role, let alone an interview.\n\nThe job market here in Vancouver (and across Canada) has been... bleak.

I really can't complain, but I just wanted to get other people's perspective.\n\n  \n**Context**\n\nI went to school for programming because I loved it. My passion was mainly in embedded systems. During college, I was lucky enough to get a position as a research engineer on a research program, and got to write the firmware for a very small satellite. I truly loved it. During this period, I submitted hundreds of job applications that went nowhere. I ended up getting my current job from a connection I made during college.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like my current job. I am not complaining in the slightest, I fully understand how lucky and privileged I am to be in my current position, and I don't take that for granted. I went through the job struggle like many others have. I even followed this sub, and almost lost hope because of it :(\n\n  \n**Question**\n\nIn my current position, I write Python microservices for a very large company. It can be interesting. Most importantly though, I couldn't be happier with my coworkers. They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them.\n\n  \nHowever, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. \n\n  \nThat being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore.\n\n  \n**Conclusion**\n\nAgain, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want*  to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week.\n\n  \n**TLDR**\n\nGot a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad. What do other SWE's do about this?\n\n  \n",

        "author": "Any-Platypus-3570",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Intro.**\n\nI wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.\n\n**Story time.**\n\nAt first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.\n\nOver the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.\n\nAfter five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.\n\nI feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.\n\n**Where I applied.**\n\nAbout 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.\n\n**The numbers.**\n\nNow for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).\n\n**Advice.**\n\nOver the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a \"Skills\" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.\n\nDon't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.\n\nI spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",

My thinking was that I'd take the route of automating everything I can to impress the devs and join them at the company, but no such luck. My company is mostly foreign, with about 70% of the staff being Chinese... including the entirety of the devs. I don't speak Chinese, and there's a blatant opportunity/ compensation bias towards my Chinese coworkers. Nonetheless, I get a few Automation certs, make a couple projects specifically for the company's benefit with the previous stack, and it gets me nowhere. A \"Thank you! Now get back to work\", and a 2% annual bump in my salary. So, while still trying to create applications/software to benefit my company, my main work has been devolved into manual testing. I'm desperately doing anything I can to code. But I feel like I've got the QA brand on me now after this long.\n\nThen I get home, see 3-5 more rejections from the prior days applications, apply to 15-20 more, leetcode, work on projects/ certs, go to the gym and lift out my frustration, and go to bed. It's been like this for **2 and a half years** now, and I'm losing my mind. I spend most of my days feeling like an absolute failure, and hating myself over this, and it's effecting my relationships because people are picking up on it now. I see friends/ acquaintances of the same age buying homes, having kids etc., that went right into the trades after high school. And I'm still living at my parent's place. I just feel so incredibly cheated and disheartened that those 4 years in college and countless post-midnight study grind sessions, along with all of the extra effort post-grad haven't gotten me anywhere.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a CEO. I'm not applying to FANG or anything like that. Just all normal, average companies. I don't care to be wildly rich. I just want to be able to comfortably support a future family, and buy a house for them, and live out the American Dream. That's literally it, and I spend so much time being bitter about that being so far away right now. I'm just so tired of hating myself and feeling like a failure. It shouldn't be like this.",

Before this, I was working as a Full Stack Developer for the last 4 years at a very small company. The typical task at my last job was very simple CRUD work with business logic sprinkled in and our whole system ran fine on a medium EC2 instance. Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.\n\nWhile I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.\n\nWe have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).\n\nWhat sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it? I feel like the last 4 years I've been playing little league and have only had to worry about such small things and picked up some bad habits, but now I'm in the big leagues and I feel so out of place.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "So a couple of years ago I wrote a script that did some clever tricks with the clipboard to streamline the otherwise manual effort of data population into an excel worksheet.  I mainly wrote it for myself because I absolutely despise repetitive work, but word got around when I showed it to ONE person and I was persuaded to turn it into a standalone GUI tool.  \n\nEventually that task I entirely automated wasn't my responsibility anymore as I got a promotion and went to work on other projects.  The individuals that wound up handling that task/responsibility heavily used my tool until it didn't work anymore because the structure of the source data changed, and the way the tool was written wasn't dynamic.  So of course, they reach out to me to update it.  \n\nI didn't really have time to update that thing, but they'd become so spoiled, I said okay.  So I rewrote it.  I implemented some pretty rudimentary data structures so it was dynamic and would work with any modifications to the source data.  I also implemented some fuzzy matching so it would populate accurately regardless, whether there were differences in case or trailing spaces or whatever.  One of the guys in the role decided to ask me for a walk through, because apparently, he has a CS degree.  He looked through the code of the older version (static/hard coded) and the new version (dynamic/fuzzy) and said he didn't understand the updates --so he was going to work with the first one.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday and he's giving a \"demo\" on his \"updates\".  On that call were members of management, eagerly anticipating something inventive and/or innovative from some supposed collaborative effort.  I join the call late because I was super busy, but when I get on, he's walking through the logic, workflow, and data structures that I wrote in the first and second version.  I'm sitting there like.. hmm.. this sounds like all of the functionality I built, and I'm wondering if I should air him out and let the entire group know.  Of course I didn't because I'm better than that, but I did ask what improvements or updates he made (that constituted the meeting).  The only thing he changed was swapping out one Excel read/write library for another, because the one I used (xlswriter) overwrites formulas in cells.  \n\nAnyway, so while the tool isn't all that much of a big deal, because, I pretty much hacked it together in a couple of hours altogether to save myself some time, I can't help feeling a little petty about this dude passing along my work as his own.  It's one thing to show the tool's usage, it's another to walk through the logic to upper-management, like he wrote the damn thing.  AITA for even caring at all?",

        "content": "I'm a not so fresh May 2023 grad.  After graduation I had an informal internship that lasted  a year, but I left do to horrible pay and false promises, and I had some important bills that had to be paid (14 hourly, semi monthly).  It lasted from November 2023 to November 2024.\n\nI feel so lost.  I really like coding and stuff but I have some issues:\n\nI suck with coming up with ideas for projects.  I finally made one prototype app that uses sleepers api for fantasy football.  It was built in python django since that is what my internship used, but remaking it in Java/Springboot since I prefer Java (https://mysleeperapi.com/). I also deployed it on my own too.  It's not much, but it's kinda cool.\n\nRight now I have low motivation due to serious depression,  and it's getting worse. I sit infront of my PC all day when not at my crappy data entry job.  I have udemy courses that I try and follow, but even that is hard sometimes.\n\nI'm kinda older than the newer grad, I turn 29 on July 11th (so i was about to turn 27 when i graduated).  I'm afraid that due to my age and lack of experience, I'll never get my foot in the door.\n\nI also have the issue on not knowing what I should do and with the current job market, it feels like I have to learn everything.\n\nLastly I feel like my region sucks for tech jobs.  I live in Northeast Ohio in the Cleveland area.\n\nMy life feels so derailed, and of course I would graduate in 2023 when everything falls apart, and I can't image being a graduate in 2024 onward.\n\nIf this is what I have to look forward to, I'd rather not be around because it's bullshit. If not CS, then what?  Nothing else interests me so I'm supposed to be misearble?  I'm supposed to have my life together right now, but that isn't the case.\n\n",

        "content": "I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.\n\nWithin a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.\n\r\nAfter leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.\n\nI interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with \"Strong Hire\" and  “Hire” ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a \"No Hire\" for the technical part and rated \"Hire\" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.\n\nAfter this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development.  Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.\n\r\nI've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.\n\r\nAfter these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:\r\n1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.\r\n2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.\r\n3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.\n\r\nNow, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:\n\r\n1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?\r\n2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?\r\n3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?\r\n4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as \"Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)\" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?\r\n5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I’m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.\n\r\nTo anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance). Interviewed at 50+ top firms cleared 5, ghosted by 4, lowballed by 1. Took a break after a high-pay freelance gig; now out of work and savings running low. Built solid MERN stack projects. Need advice on CTC strategy, resume positioning, target companies, and rebuilding momentum.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for people who might have gone through what I’m going through right now, and how they overcame it. I recently graduated college so I haven’t seen most of the world as of yet. \n\nI’m a Junior dev right now. 2 years of experience - this is the first and only place I’ve worked at. And it’s the only team I’ve worked with. I joined here straight out of college. \n\nLately l have begun realizing just how emotionally invested I’ve become in this workplace. I’m so scared that this attachment will cause me to harm my own career as I would be resistant to switching jobs in the future, if I don’t fix this. \n\nFirst off, I have the best manager ever. Obviously I don’t have any reference points, as this is my first manager, but hearing stories from my friends - I consider myself to be pretty lucky. My manager is always pushing me to be the best, other senior leadership has told me that my manager talks very good about me to them, she is always available to explain things and is stern when I make mistakes. I’ve never been pinpointed or blamed for when Prod issues have happened, just reminded that these are very important incidents to learn from. I work in a finance heavy industry, so I had to learn A LOT about finance, and she taught me all of it. \n\nSecond, my team is flexible. We aren’t expected to log in early if the need isn’t there. My manager is also fine with me taking multiple consecutive days off together if need be. We aren’t too personal with each other and I like the boundaries that everyone maintains. \n\nThe work itself - it’s not tooooo interesting. I do work in finance, so it’s hard for me to accept what I’m doing actually matters. It feels like a zero sum game to me. The problems we solve with engineering have more to do with reducing the manual work for finance bros. So I always feel like I’m working underneath them as opposed to with them. The work hours can also stretch to 9/10 hours a day, sometimes.\n\nThe end users of the product are a pain in the ass. They are the finance bros and they have an attitude problem. I do not like working for them or along with them. They don’t understand the complexity of software systems. They think just because a feature sounds so simple in their head it’s simple to build as well. \n\nThe top-layer engineering leadership is also uninspiring. Their only motivation is (and they’ve spoken this out loud multiple times) to keep the finance bros happy and not lose our credibility in front of them. It feels like my job only exists to please them. \n\nWhich is why in my head I want to change jobs, maybe look for something more interesting, fun and inspiring. But then I’m reminded of my star manager and amazing team. What if I’m actually very lucky where I am right now? What if I change jobs and it’s a stupid decision? I could be stuck somewhere where the manager is ass and working against me. I don’t know what to do. Is your guys’ work like this as well? ",

It's a tiny company, and the pay is nothing to write home about (I'm living with my dad since I can't afford rent in my city) I'm learning a lot though, and there's many opportunities to lead feature initiatives within the company which is nice for a first job. I can recognize there's no room for growth here beyond that though.\n\nMy issue is not really knowing how to keep progressing my career. I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something. These posts saturate social media to the point where it seems like the only paths to wealth are: Get a big tech internship while in school and land a return offer, make a 7 figure startup, or be banished to irrelevancy.\n\nI'm interested in those of you that were (are) in my shoes; what would you recommend someone like me do to keep progressing their career and land a reputable job in some big tech company? Is it just a matter of experience and interview prep, or should I be doing more like getting a masters?  And does anyone have good advice to help with the anxiety of comparing yourself to those seemingly more successful/younger than you?\n\nThank you!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Long story short, I landed an amazing job as a SWE. It's at a very well known FAANG+ company and the team is sort of new and we'll be working on some interesting problems. Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.\n\nThen there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).\n\nI never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.\n\nI realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.\n\nSo, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated!\n\n  \n**Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

All the info required to debug is present and there, but it could be cleaned up a little. I just don’t understand how my ticket for implementation of new features became the clean up the test steps display ticket. Am I being immature? How should I handle this?",

Recently I've been put in more of a leadership role where I have to manage delivery for a team of 5, now 8 as of this week, engineers and 3 QE.\n\n\n\nWhile I think I'm getting better at it, it also feels like there's never enough time to do all the things I need to do. I'm in meetings 6 hours a day, have to achieve increasingly difficult timelines, need to plan ahead for upcoming sprints and further on the roadmap, make sure capacity is being fully utilized, parallelize as much of the work as possible, help the developers grow, unblock them, provide technical leadership, accelerate them to meet deadlines, provide feedback to their managers, etc.\n\n\n\nRun on sentence is intended, but the main idea is that I'm overwhelmed with all that I'm responsible for. I have a project manager type person to support me, and recently we've had a more productive relationship in a way that they manage the backlog in Jira independently after we've scoped out the work and what can be done in parallel. They've started using ChatGPT to initially populate the details and we later review each of the stories when it's closer to the time someone needs to pickup the work. \n\nI have trouble gauging when my engineers are underperforming, or if I haven't provided enough support. I'm use to holding myself to my own standards, but I also feel like it's not fair to hold others to my own standards, because while they work for me and my personality, I feel like it's too high of a bar to force on others unless they opt in.\n\nI continually think about just leaving and being an IC somewhere else, but I also feel like 30 years from now I wont want to be an IC due to the changing landscape of the CS world.\n\nI think what I'm looking for is advice on how others manage it. It feels like as soon as I got good at the engineering part, I don't spend nearly as much time engineering. Managing other people in delivery feels like a different skillset than the one that I've been focusing on for most of my career.",

I don't feel like I grew as a developer for some of those years. I still feel like a junior dev sometimes. Mid-level at best. Most of my work has been very similar bug fixes and QOL upgrades. I have been gradually gaining trust to work on larger issues over the years though, especially recently. \n\nI've suggested and implemented some design changes for certain modules, but most were small changes. Recently, while working on some bug fixes, I realized that a certain system needs a pretty dramatic re-design, which I am currently working on. We also have a relatively new dev and since we've returned to office, I've kinda been her default mentor for showing her how some of our systems work. This led me to thinking that I may be closer for a senior position than I originally thought.\n\nI know my technical skills still need a lot of improving. I've gotten complacent only working with our outdated tech stack (and general practices if I'm being honest). I haven't done much outside learning/coding over the years, but I am currently re-learning React and I'm finally working on a personal project that isn't from tutorial hell.",

I worked on basic internal stuff nothing big didn't touch anything no API, Cloud , LLM, Kafka or even database ( well we use postgres in our service so I did write a few queries which were a bit complicated) I just wrote code that connected different parts of the system either to improve quality or performance. The only remotely complicated thing I have done is a concurrent implementation of an event message that's pushed into Kafka. I take help often I make silly mistakes and don't really know what I'm doing most of the time. I don't come up with solutions I sometimes fill in the blanks if my senior gives me a hint. I really don't know why I'm not getting any negative feedback from anyone I truly don't know even if I take forever to finish simple stuff they say it's nothing out of ordinary to take a few days extra.\n\nMy question: I'm not good at this I can't solve real problems I don't know what I am doing and somehow got lucky with a team and company.how do I deal with my own mediocrity? What can be done if a task needs me to actually solve something? Can one like me improve enough to be productively employable in this day and age of competition and AI. ",

I will remain hopeful though and with an open mind. I saw more ai websites and stuff like that and was wondering if anyone used any of those or any other strategy I may not know about.

For the next 3 years, I grew it to a team of 40 people and was in active negotiations with Nvidia to introduce RTX into our game (it was 2019 when Nvidia just published it). I was studying just enough to keep the scholarship, but nothing more.\n\nAfter we ran out of funding, and closing it, I joined an American based startup as VP of Product & engineering, but after 6 months got promoted to CIO, where I was responsible for our product portfolio and managing our engineering and R&D departments.\n\nDuring this time, I got headhunted by one of the largest corporations in Europe and wanted me to work as Senior Project Manager (had to wear Product Manager hat too often). They made it clear, they wanted me no mater what, doubled my salary and put me in big projects to work for.  And after 2.5 years, it was one of the most amazing working experiences as had to deal with hundreds of engineers and millions of dollars in projects.\n\nAfter some internal things, I decided to go in business on my own, and start a digital agency. it was one of the roughest experiences even though within 1 year I had 3 other employees and 15 clients. And decided to close this in beginning of June.\n\n\\-- now July --\n\nI had an interview today, and one of the HR said that my CV seems like I'm lying. I just turned 29, so it is impossible for me to have done all of this. (I have recommendation letters, experience, posts and everything to prove my work...).  I asked some of my friends about this and they said the same thing too, and even suggested I lower the tittle for example from CIO to just Head of Product Management Office.\n\nI'm looking to join startups where I can bring best of my experience and knowledge, but I am seriously getting worried what my friends are suggesting.\n\nfrom 50 tailored applications I have done, I've had only 1 interview, so I'm really wondering if ATS is screwing me up, or HR see's it and thinks \"just bloated stuff\" and ignores it.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nim seriously stuck thinking for this.\n\nPS: made this post on EU version but got automatically removed.

Tbh, we hardly had meetings and just had stand up oince a day and outside of that it was mostly reaching out to people for help and once a month a product meeting with the clients. Once a quarter we had a 2 day sprint planning event that really was a waste of 2 days with most engineers just nodding along while the managers and POs did all the talking.\n\nSecond job was in FAANG - it seemed like even as a mid-level Engineer I had to spend half my day in meetings, a quarter of my day reaching out to people and the rest of the time coding. Obviously 2 hours coding isnt enough, so it caused people to have to work an extra 2-4 hours a day. Stand up was everyday for 30 minutes. No meetings friday was hardly respected. If you werent it felt like you were behind if your days didnt look like this. It was very on the go. Even in the meetings, it felt like everything was a discussion that took an extra hour of meeting time. ANythign brought up during parking lot took an hour to resolve. You put a for loop but a principal engineer wants you to do a while loop? Let's discuss it for an hour about why for loops are better or worse. If you needed to talk to anybody, you had to schedule time and theyd get annoyed if you went over the alloted scheduled time. It was stressfula nd when I left I was glad I was gone.\n\nCurrent job is at big tech but not FAANG - It seems meetings are the last thing on their mind. We have stand up twice a week. Twice a month we have an extended stand up. Even then it goes by pretty quickly (most of the time it takes half the scheduled time). Parking lot items are resolved really fast unless someone is confused about the code. Im still fairly new but i get the vibe that it's similar to my first job where you can just reach out to someone and tehy didnt mind spending an hour with you to talk it through. Once a quarter they do a \"no meetings week\" where major meetings are cancelled. This was a shocker i've never heard about, in my last job that is something laughable and seen as a waste of useful time. What's surprsiing is I make more in this job than I did in FAANG for what seems like will be less stress.\n\nJust wondering how common it is in other jobs when it comes to meetings?\n\nEdit: im 7 YOE as a backend SWE if that helps.

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.\n\nThere's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice.   \nI want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.\n\nIn 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.\n\nOr maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until  things start to click - just like it was for the first time:)  \n  \nWhat's your view/advice?

It never fits, n this just tells me I don't actually know the algo well enough.\n\nI've developed some newer habits while prepping for some upcoming interviews, and I find that this approach I can learn the mechanics of the problem thoroughly and surprisingly I get success only after a couple clicks.\n\nI still spend a lot of time sussing out my solution, but in the end I feel like I really understand what to do.\n\nBasically:\n\n* I read the problem and based off what I currently know I just try to work it out in my head. I don't even write anything down. I just try to visualize it, with my current set of tools. A lot of walking around the house, talking to myself.\n* After I kinda adjust everything in my head, I open up AI chat and then i tell it my approach. I don't ask for code, I just want it to tell me what it thinks of my approach\n* I go back and forth repeatedly with AI on this. Until I have a better sense of what I want to code. Rinse & repeat, I still haven't written or asked for code\n* If i can't formulate something then I go to YT and look for a short on how the problem is generally solved - Neetcode is great for this because he'll visualize it for you before diving into code. I try to make sense of it before seeing how he solves the problem, but if it clicks then i don't even bother, but he does write in python often - I'm primiarly JS/TS so its nice that i still have to do the translation in my head\n* Then I finally start writing my approach and since I've gone over it repeatedly in my head, I have better direction. Your IDE will identify most of the silly bugs so, you just need to return something - this is my own IDE, not in LC's code editor.\n* When I'm done, I don't even run it - I just have AI review it and tell me again where I\"ve messed something up. Again, no code, just more back and forth with AI. Maybe I find that there's prob a better approach, so I redo my solution.\n* When AI (claude in my case) says it looks good, then I finally run it in leetcode/whatevercode. Usually there's minimal things i need to fix. I've been getting successful submits on the first try\n\nTLDR\n\nThis is basically me, a visual learner, self taught - drilling into my head what I think will be a solid approach based off what I actually understand well. The repetition and being corrected _in discussion_ is really really good for me. A lot more time is spent thinking about the problem and talking through the different parts of the solution. The least amount of time is on the code, and there's almost no trial and error clicking. Feels great.\n\nThe funny part is I don't really have the patience to go through the entire AI response, so I kinda skim just for \"this is where the problem is\". I don't even read the whole thing because I try to connect the dots of what its suggesting, on my own.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. And yes, it's midnight on a Friday, and I'm workin on DSA.

There's also the problem where more recently it seems like all the entry level stuff has completely dried up, I only find one thing every few days at this point (everything else seems to want people who are 3+ years of experience in everything for something that says \"entry level\") (Even when I look for random low level help desk and other things they want people with a ton of experience always, and also they want \"excellent communicators\" which is something I am not)\n\nMy [resume](https://imgur.com/a/xnfQFTn) is pretty bad but there's nothing significant I can change about it. The internships I got in college weren't really very computer science oriented (a lot of hardware stuff) which is just a big red flag on my resume I can't do anything with (sidenote: company A is like 1 guy so I probably can't go back there for a job, it's also not very programming based so I don't want to do it forever either). (sidenote 2: Yes I tried to get other internships, but my resume was even worse back then and the market wasn't exactly much better back then versus now). It probably looks bad that I had internships in the summer only but company A is a local place so I can't exactly stay there while going to college. I don't have metrics for everything which makes it look bad (are interns really supposed to be doing corporate espionage to look at company records to see the exact dollar value of everything they did?) (And I can't really lie and make up stuff since that would just look like obvious lies, some of the metrics I already have are already like that)\n\nI had a 3.93 GPA for my bachelors but that isn't actually very good (one of the people that interviewed me actually grilled me for not having a perfect 4.0, probably a reason I got rejected). Project wise I just have some projects on there, but those projects aren't \"real\" projects since 2 of them were class projects and the other one is something that didn't make money so companies probably just see it as just a random toy project. I'm also not an expert in all the 10 random technologies that get put in every job posting as well, which probably leads me to getting tossed out (even if I was, companies probably ignore everything that wasn't something I did in internships which cuts me out of 99% of positions)\n\n(My parents want me to apply to every random X years of experience position out there, which just seems pointless since in what world would I be put above the people who actually have X years of experience?)\n\n**Other things**\n\n* Networking\n   * Networking is a complete non starter as I don't have the social skills to ever convince someone that I'm the best person for the job. My personality is pretty unlikeable (very introverted, don't like talking, not really capable of showing enthusiasm) and I have very little in common with other people\n   * The people I've encountered in my classes aren't really going to help me either (presumably most of them are now entry level people as well and so they have 0 influence on the hiring process of any company)\n   * There's basically 0 chance I become the hiring managers best friend and become someone they push ahead of other people\n* Internships\n   * Not in college anymore, internships only take current students\n* Projects\n   * Making a \"good project\" isn't something I can just do. To make the kind of project that actually impresses employers I would have to make a significant amount of money, and those kind of ideas are very hard to come by. Plus, that kind of thing would take 1 year or several years to actually produce which I can't exactly spend that amount of time unemployed (or in some menial dead end job) without leaving me stuck in that job because they think I can't do anything better\n* Do more leetcode\n   * 99% of the time I don't even get to a point where they even give me any kind of technical evaluation, so it doesn't really help me to practice that more. It's not something I can put in a job application to get further\n* Move somewhere with more jobs\n   * Terrible idea, I don't have a ton of money to waste moving out somewhere (especially considering how badly my job search is going, moving somewhere else isn't going to magically be 100x better)\n* Lie on resume\n   * Also a complete non starter. I don't have the charisma to back up lies on my resume. Stretching experience numbers is something I'm already doing, but I can't just make up years of experience out of nowhere without making it look like obvious lies\n   * If I say I have experience at X place then that would get seen in a background check and then I get thrown out immediately\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Sorry if this is the wrong place for this question\n\nWas recently laid off from my first-ever SWE job at a Fortune 500 company after working there for 2.5 years. Having a difficult time finding a new job -- I think part of it is that only 2.5 years puts me at an uncomfortable position where I'm not a new grad but also not exactly an experienced dev, but the other problem is that I just feel like I... can't *do* anything. \n\nAt my company I spent the majority of the time on our bug-fixing team. Idk if this is how things usually are at big companies but our codebase was largely undocumented and no one ever explained to me how anything really worked -- everything I learned I learned because I asked about it directly. Most of the bugs I fixed were either very clear-cut, where I could just look at the code and identify the problem, or for more abstract ones I did it with a lot of guidance from a senior dev. I spent a bit of time on other teams \"helping\" implement new features but I was largely in over my head and being held by the hand by my seniors while just trying to absorb whatever I could. \n\nSo I know how to code I guess. I can pick up new languages and I can look at simple things and sort of understand what they're doing and I understand principles like data structures, algorithms, encapsulation, inheritance, etc, all stuff you would find in a college course. I've also done 100+ puzzles on AdventOfCode, which I usually find to be not super difficult but have also learned about stuff I wasn't super knowledgeable about like dynamic programming and sorting algos while doing them. \n\nI feel like I'm a good employee. I'm not afraid to ask questions and I'm well-spoken and I'm proactive about my work rather than sitting in silence when I get stuck. I love to learn new stuff and always take opportunities that are presented to me. \n\nBut I don't feel like any of my knowledge transfers to an actual workplace environment. I can't build apps or  deploy microservices or optimize software or develop new features. I subscribe to /r/programming and read stuff there but I usually understand like 5% of it. I thought I would learn once I got my first job but I spent most of that time fixing bugs and trying to understand how our product even worked. I was discussing moving to a different team to start gaining more skills with my supervisor but then I was laid off. I know lots of programmers build stuff in their free time but I have no idea what to even make. I don't even know if I *can* make anything. So what do I do? How do I learn? Hope I get a better job? Do a boot camp? Grad school?\n\nWould be very greatful to hear how any of you transitioned from being a booksmart college level programmer to an actual developer",

Mathematics has never been an issue for me, so that isn’t really a problem. I have never really had any experience in coding other than a tech class is second grade. \nDo I need to have a strong foundation in coding before the schooling, or can I go into a computer science program and expect to learn coding from the basics. \nI have also heard that software engineering used to be a very competitive market, is it still this way? Is it almost impossible to land an internship and job? And does the recent advancements in AI worry in software engineers and their job security? ",
