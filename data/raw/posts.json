I had Airbyte working on our RKE2 Cluster, but it kept failing due to not enough resources. I finally spun up an SNC with K3S with 16GB Ram / 8CPUs. Now Airbyte won’t even deploy on this new cluster. Temporal deployment keeps failing, bootloader keeps telling me about a missing environment variable in a secrets file I never specified in extraEnv. I’ve tried v1 and v2 charts, they’re both not working. V2 chart is the worst, the helm template throws an error of an ingressClass config missing at the root of the values file, but the official helm chart doesn’t show an ingressClass config file there. It’s driving me nuts.\n\nAny recommendations out there for simpler OSS ELT pipeline tools I can use? To sync data between Postgres and Google BigQuery?\n\nThank you!",

This guide I found really helped me bridge the gap between all the “bookish” theory I’m studying and how things actually work in the real world.\n\nFor example, earlier this semester I was learning about the classic three-tier architecture (moving data from source systems → staging area → warehouse). Sounds neat in theory, but when you actually start looking into modern setups with data lakes, real-time streaming, and hybrid cloud environments, it gets messy real quick.\n\nI’ve tried YouTube and random online courses before, but the problem is they’re often either too shallow or too scattered. Having a sort of one-stop resource that explains concepts while aligning with what I’m studying and what I see at work makes it so much easier to connect the dots.\n\nSharing here in case it helps someone else who’s just starting their data journey and wants to understand data architecture in a simpler, practical way.\n\n[https://www.exasol.com/hub/data-warehouse/architecture/\n](https://www.exasol.com/hub/data-warehouse/architecture/)",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m considering taking a break from book learning and instead contributing to a full-scale open-source project to deepen my practical skills.\n\nMy goals are:\n- Gaining a deeper understanding of tools commonly used by data engineers\n- Improving my grasp of real-world software engineering practices\n- Learning more about database internals and algorithms (a particular area of interest)\n- Becoming a stronger contributor at work\n- Supporting my long-term career growth\n\nWhat I’m considering:\n- I’d like to learn a compiled language like C++ or Rust, but as a first open-source project, that might be biting off too much. I know Python well, so working in Python for my initial contribution would probably let me focus on understanding the codebase itself rather than struggling with language syntax.\n- I’m attracted to many projects, but my main worry is picking one that’s not regularly used at work—I'm concerned I’ll need to invest a lot more time outside of work to really get up to speed, both with the tool and the ecosystem around it.\n\nProject choices I’m evaluating:\n- dbt-core: My first choice, since we rely on it for all data transformations at work. It’s Python-based, which fits my skills, and would likely help me get a better grip on both the tool and large-scale engineering practices. The downside: it may soon see fewer new features or even eventual deprecation in favor of dbt-fusion (Rust). While I’m open to learning Rust, that feels like a steep learning curve for a first contribution, and I’m concerned I’d struggle to ramp up.\n- Airflow: My second choice. Also Python, core to our workflows, likely to have strong long-term support, but not directly database-related.\n- Clickhouse / Polars / DuckDB: We use Clickhouse at work, but its internals (and those of Polars and DuckDB) look intimidating—with the added challenge of needing to learn a new (compiled) language. I suspect the learning curve here would be pretty steep.\n- Scikit-learn: Python-based, and interesting to me thanks to my data science background. Could greatly help reinforce algorithmic skills, which seem like a required step to understand what happens inside a database. However, I don’t use it at work, so I worry the experience wouldn’t translate or stick as well, and it would require a massive investment of time outside of work\n\nI would love any advice on how to choose the right open-source project, how to balance learning new tech versus maximizing work relevance, and any tips for first-time contributors.\n",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Hi r/dataengineering \n\nWhen building high-performance storage systems, the performance bottleneck in write-intensive scenarios often lies in the in-memory data structures. Traditional MemTables based on Skip-Lists or B-Trees, while excellent at maintaining data order, can become a performance drag under high-concurrency writes due to their complex internal node operations.\n\nTo break through this barrier, my colleague and I designed and open-sourced a brand new, high-performance in-memory KV storage engine: **Columnar MemTable**. It leverages a suite of modern C++17 techniques and clever concurrency designs to achieve astonishing performance. In our benchmarks, its concurrent write throughput reached **\\~17 million ops/s**, 3.5 times that of a traditional Skip-List implementation. Single-threaded batch writes hit an incredible **\\~52 million ops/s**, a 50x improvement over Skip-Lists. In mixed read-write scenarios, its performance soared to **\\~61 million ops/s**, leading by a factor of 4.\n\nThis blog post will serve as a tutorial, taking you on a deep dive into the internal world of Columnar MemTable to dissect the core design philosophy and implementation details behind its high performance.\n\n**Core Design Philosophy: Separate the Hot Path, Process Asynchronously**\n\nThe foundation of Columnar MemTable's high performance can be summarized in one sentence: **Completely separate the write hot path from the background processing cold path.**\n\n* **An Extremely Optimized Write Path:** All write operations go into an \"active block\" (FlashActiveBlock) tailor-made for concurrent writes. At this stage, we don't care about global data order; we pursue the absolute maximum write speed and lowest latency.\n* **Asynchronous Organization and Consolidation:** Once an active block is full, it is \"sealed\" and seamlessly handed over as a whole to a dedicated background thread.\n* **Leisurely Background Processing:** The background thread is responsible for sorting the sealed data, converting its format, building indexes, and even performing compaction. All these time-consuming operations are completely decoupled from the foreground write path, ensuring stable and efficient write performance.\n\n# A Simple Architecture Diagram\n\n[Columnar MemTable Design](https://preview.redd.it/vzchkgjz43qf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74fb77e99e8e0f228c77ed1e8b48ce92e02ee96)\n\nAs you can see, Columnar MemTable is essentially an in-memory LSM-Tree. However, because the MemTable itself has a limited size, it doesn't generate a huge number of sorted blocks (usually just a dozen or so). Therefore, in-memory compaction isn't strictly necessary. My implementation provides a configuration option to enable or disable compaction for in-memory sorted blocks, with it being disabled by default.\n\nNext, we'll dive into the code to break down the key components that realize this philosophy.\n\n**Deep Dive into the Write Path (The \"Hot\" Zone)**\n\nThe write path is the key to performance. We minimize lock contention through sharding and a clever memory allocation mechanism.\n\n**1. Sharding**\n\nLike all high-performance concurrent components, sharding is the first line of defense. ColumnarMemTable maintains an array of Shards. By taking the hash of a key modulo the number of shards, we distribute different keys to different shards, which greatly reduces concurrency conflicts.\n\n        \n      // Locate the corresponding Shard using the key's hash\n    size_t GetShardIdx(std::string_view key) const { \n      return hasher_(key) & shard_mask_;\n    } \n\n**2. FlashActiveBlock: The Core of Write Operations**\n\nAll current writes within a Shard are handled by a FlashActiveBlock. It consists of two parts:\n\n* **ColumnarRecordArena**: A memory allocator designed for concurrent writes.\n* **ConcurrentStringHashMap**: A quasi-lock-free hash index for fast point lookups within the active block.\n\n**3. ColumnarRecordArena**\n\nTraditional memory allocators require locking under high concurrency, whereas ColumnarRecordArena almost completely eliminates contention between write threads by using Thread-Local Storage (TLS) and atomic operations.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Thread-Exclusive Data Blocks:** The first time a thread writes, it's allocated its own ThreadLocalData, which contains a series of DataChunks. A thread only writes to its own DataChunk, avoiding data races at the source.\n* **Lock-Free In-Block Allocation:** How do we safely allocate space within a DataChunk for multiple threads (although by design TLS is mostly accessed by a single thread, we aim for maximum robustness)? The answer is a 64-bit atomic variable, positions\\_.\n   * The **high 32 bits** store the number of allocated records.\n   * The **low 32 bits** store the number of bytes used in the buffer.\n\nWhen a thread needs to allocate space, it enters a Compare-And-Swap (CAS) loop:\n\n        \n      // Simplified core logic of AllocateAndAppend\n    uint64_t old_pos = chunk->positions_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);\n    while (true) {\n        // Parse old record index and buffer position\n        uint32_t old_ridx = static_cast<uint32_t>(old_pos >> 32);\n        uint32_t old_bpos = static_cast<uint32_t>(old_pos);\n    \n        // Check if there's enough space\n        if (old_ridx >= kRecordCapacity || old_bpos + required_size > kBufferCapacity) {\n            break; // Not enough space, need to switch to a new Chunk\n        }\n    \n        // Calculate the new position\n        uint64_t new_pos = (static_cast<uint64_t>(old_ridx + 1) << 32) | (old_bpos + required_size);\n    \n        // Atomically update the position\n        if (chunk->positions_.compare_exchange_weak(old_pos, new_pos, ...)) {\n            // CAS successful, allocation complete\n            record_idx = old_ridx;\n            buffer_offset = old_bpos;\n            goto allocation_success;\n        }\n        // CAS failed, means another thread interfered. Retry the loop.\n    } \n\nThis approach avoids heavyweight mutexes (std::mutex), achieving safe and efficient memory allocation with only lightweight atomic operations.\n\n**4. ConcurrentStringHashMap: A Fast Index for Active Data**\n\nOnce data is written to ColumnarRecordArena, we need a fast way to find it. ConcurrentStringHashMap is designed for this. It's based on linear probing and uses atomic tags to handle concurrency.\n\n* **Tag Mechanism:** Each slot has an 8-bit atomic tag. EMPTY\\_TAG (0xFF) means the slot is empty, and LOCKED\\_TAG (0xFE) means it's being written to. When inserting, a thread first tries to CAS the tag from EMPTY\\_TAG to LOCKED\\_TAG. If successful, it safely writes the data and then updates the tag to its final value.\n* **Lock-Free Reads:** Read operations are completely lock-free. They just need to atomically read the tag and other data for comparison. This makes point lookups (Get) in the active block extremely fast.\n\n**From Hot to Cold: Sealing and Background Processing**\n\nThings get more complex when a FlashActiveBlock reaches its size threshold.\n\n1. **Seal**\n\n* A foreground thread acquires a lightweight SpinLock for the shard.\n* It marks the current active\\_block\\_ as sealed.\n* It creates a new, empty FlashActiveBlock to replace it.\n* It places the sealed block into a global background processing queue.\n* It releases the lock.\n\nThis entire process is very fast, with minimal impact on foreground writes.\n\n**2. Background Worker Thread (BackgroundWorkerLoop):**\n\nAn independent background thread continuously pulls sealed blocks from the queue.\n\n* **Data Consolidation:** It iterates through all the data in the sealed block's ColumnarRecordArena, converting it from a fragmented, multi-threaded layout into a compact, contiguous columnar block (ColumnarBlock).\n* **Columnar Storage (Structure-of-Arrays):** ColumnarBlock stores all keys, values, and types in separate std::vectors. This layout dramatically improves cache locality, especially for future analytical scan queries (OLAP), as it allows reading only the required columns.\n* **Parallel Sorting:** After consolidation, the background thread calls a Sorter (defaulting to ParallelRadixSorter) to sort all records in the ColumnarBlock by key. Radix sort is highly efficient for strings, and parallelizing it fully utilizes multi-core CPUs.\n* **Generate SortedColumnarBlock:** Once sorted, a final, immutable, read-only SortedColumnarBlock is generated. To accelerate future reads, we also build:\n   * **Bloom Filter:** To quickly determine if a key might exist, effectively filtering out a large number of queries for non-existent keys.\n   * **Sparse Index:** We sample a key every N records (e.g., 16). When querying, we first use the sparse index to quickly locate an approximate range, then perform a binary search within that small range, avoiding the overhead of a binary search over the entire dataset.\n\nAs you can see, this SortedColumnarBlock is very similar to a Level 0 SSTable in an LSM-Tree.\n\n**The Complete Query Path**\n\nWhat is the lifecycle of a Get(key) request? It searches through data from newest to oldest to ensure it reads the latest version:\n\n1. **Check the Active Block:** First, it searches in the current shard's FlashActiveBlock using its ConcurrentStringHashMap. This is the hottest, newest data and usually results in the fastest hits.\n2. **Check Sealed Blocks:** If not found, it iterates in reverse through the list of sealed\\_blocks in the shard that have been sealed but not yet processed by the background thread.\n3. **Check Sorted Blocks:** If still not found, it finally iterates in reverse through the list of SortedColumnarBlocks that have been processed. Here, it first uses the Bloom filter and sparse index for quick pruning before performing a precise lookup.\n\nIf the key is not found anywhere, or if the last record found is a Delete type, it returns std::nullopt.\n\nHere, to ensure memory safety, we need to maintain a reference count while searching the Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks to prevent the MemTable from deallocating them. However, incrementing a shared\\_ptr's reference count on the Get path is very expensive and prevents Get operations from scaling across multiple cores. Using raw pointers, on the other hand, introduces memory safety issues.\n\nOur solution uses a **thread-local shared\\_ptr** and maintains a **global sequence number**. When the set of Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks is modified (e.g., a block is sealed), the global sequence number is incremented. When a Get operation occurs, it checks if its locally cached sequence number matches the global one.\n\n* **If they match (the common case)**, the thread-local shared\\_ptrs are still valid. The query can proceed using these cached pointers, completely avoiding an expensive atomic ref-count operation.\n* **If the local number is outdated**, the thread must update its local shared\\_ptr cache and sequence number (a much rarer event). This design allows our Get performance to scale effectively on multi-core systems.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work**\n\nAlthough Columnar MemTable excels at writes and point lookups, it's not a silver bullet.\n\n**Adaptation Issues with RocksDB**\n\nThe current design is not well-suited to be a drop-in MemTable plugin for RocksDB. A core requirement for RocksDB is an Iterator that can traverse all data in the MemTable in sorted order. In our implementation, data in the FlashActiveBlock is unsorted. To provide a globally sorted iterator, we would have to sort the active block's data on-the-fly every time an iterator is created and merge it with the already sorted blocks. This on-the-fly sorting is extremely expensive and completely defeats our write-optimized design philosophy. Therefore, perfectly adapting to RocksDB would require further design changes, such as maintaining some degree of local order within the active block. One idea is to replace FlashActiveBlock with a skiplist, but that would essentially turn it into an in-memory RocksDB (haha).\n\n**Ideal Use Cases**\n\nThe current ColumnarMemTable is specifically designed for scenarios like:\n\n* **Extremely high write throughput and concurrent point lookups:** For example, real-time metrics monitoring, user behavior logging, and other write-heavy, read-light workloads.\n* **In-memory buffer for OLAP engines:** Its native columnar format makes it a perfect in-memory staging area for OLAP databases (like ClickHouse). When data is flushed from memory to disk, it can be done directly in the efficient columnar format. Even while in memory, its columnar properties can be leveraged for pre-aggregation calculations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nColumnarMemTable is an exploration and a breakthrough in traditional MemTable design. By separating the hot write path from background processing and designing highly optimized data structures for each—a thread-local arena allocator, a quasi-lock-free hash index, parallel radix sort, and columnar blocks with Bloom filters and sparse indexes—we have successfully built an in-memory KV engine with outstanding performance under write-intensive and mixed workloads.\n\nI hope this design deep dive has given you some inspiration.

It auto-replicates data (CDC with ClickPipes) from the OLTP store to CH, generates TypeScript types from schemas, and scaffolds APIs + SDKs (with MooseStack) so frontend components can consume analytics without bespoke glue code. Local dev environment hot reloads with code changes, including local ClickHouse that you can seed with data from remote environment.\n\n**Links (no paywalls or tracking):**  \n**Guide:** [https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-powered-apis-in-react-app-moosestack](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-powered-apis-in-react-app-moosestack)  \n**Demo link:** [https://area-code-lite-web-frontend-foobar.preview.boreal.cloud](https://area-code-lite-web-frontend-foobar.preview.boreal.cloud/)  \n**Demo repo:** [https://github.com/514-labs/area-code/tree/main/ufa-lite](https://github.com/514-labs/area-code/tree/main/ufa-lite)\n\n**Stack**: Postgres, ClickPipes, ClickHouse, TypeScript, MooseStack, Boreal, Vite + React\n\n**Benchmarks**: front end application shows the query speed of queries against the transactional and analytics back-end (try it yourself!). By way of example, the blog has a gif of an example query on 4m rows returning in sub half second from ClickHouse and 17+ seconds on an equivalent PG.What I’d love feedback on:\n\n* Preferred CDC approach (Debezium? custom? something else?)\n* How you handle schema evolution between OLTP and CH without foot-guns\n* Where you draw the line on materialized views vs. query-time transforms for user-facing analytics\n* Any gotchas with backfills and idempotency I should bake in\n* Do y'all care about the local dev experience? In the blog, I show replicating the project locally and seeding it with data from the production database.\n* We have a hosting service in the works that it's public alpha right now (it's running this demo, and  production workloads at scale) but if you'd like to poke around and give us some feedback: [http://boreal.cloud](http://boreal.cloud/)\n\n*Affiliation note: I am at Fiveonefour (maintainers of open source MooseStack), and I collaborated with friends at ClickHouse on this demo; links are non-commercial, just a write-up + code.*",

        "author": "lilde1297",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi. I’ve been doing data engineering for 3 years now and I’m mostly self taught. I am the primary data engineer for my team, which resides outside of IT. My tech stack is currently python scripts running on cron. My IT has a seperate etl stack using SSIS. This is not an SSIS rant. This is an honest inquiry about how to proceed with the situation at my job.  \n\nMy team started using Python before I was hired and to my knowledge without the approval of the dba. I now mange the environment and I am looking to get a modern set up with Airflow running in azure on a couple VMs. The dba is not happy that I don’t use SSIS and I feel kind of stuck since I was hired to write Python anyway.  I’m also watching more people in my organization develop Python skills so I feel like it makes sense for me to align with the skills of the org as a whole. We also just aquired Snowflake and I feel like Python works better with that kind of data warehouse.\n\nNow I do understand some of my dba point of view. My team just did their own thing and he feels that was wrong. I don’t know the whole story as to why things ended up this way and I’ve heard critiques of both IT and my team.   My environment wasn’t setup with the best security in mind. I am working to rectify this but I’ve bumped heads with the dba on a solution because he never feels the security is enough and doesn’t trust me fully. I am trying to run Airflow on azure as I said and my plan is to store anything sensitive in key vault and call the secrets at runtime.   This should be secure enough to get his sign off but that’s to be seen.\n\nNow when it comes to what tool to use(Python, ssis, airflow, etc.) I feel stuck between everyone. On one hand my dba wants to say SSIS and that’s it. I’ve tried SSIS and I prefer Python. If needed I could use SSIS but I’ve brought up other issues such as my dba doesn’t use CI/CD or version control and I think that is very important in a modern setup.  Additionally the dba didn’t have other people on his team who knew and a could support ssis until recently and their still new to it.  On the flip side I know that the dba team doesn’t have any people who know Airflow or Python  so I understand when my dba says that he can’t support Python.  I know there are people outside of that team and IT who do know Python though.\n\nWhen it comes down to it I guess I’m trying to figure out if I’m making the right call and telling my dba that I’m going to use Airflow and make it as secure as possible or should I give in because ssis is what he knows? Also should he even have as much say as he does in the agency data engineering stack when he is the dba and he doesn’t develop the pipelines himself?  \n\nAlso I’d love to hear if any of you have had similiar experiences or are in companies where there are different data engineering stacks that live outside of IT.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I just wanted to share a project that I had to postpone working on a month or two ago because of work responsibilities. I kind of envisioned it as a combination of n8n and tableau. Basically you use nodes to connect to data sources, transform data, and connect to ML models and graphs.\n\nIt has 4 main components: A visual workflow builder, the backend for the workflows, a widget-based dashboard builder, and a backend for the dashboards. Each can be hosted separately via Docker.\n\nEssentially, you can build an ETL pipeline via nodes with the visual workflow builder, connect it to graph/model widgets in the dashboard builder, and deploy the backends. You can even easily embed your widgets/dashboards into any other website by generating a token in the dashboard builder.\n\nMy favorite node is the web source node which aims to (albeit not perfectly as of yet) scrape structured or unstructured data by visually clicking elements from a website loaded in an iframe.\n\nI just wanted to share this with the broader community because I think it could be really cool, especially if people contributed nodes/widgets/features based on their own interests or needs. Anyways, the repository is [https://github.com/markm39/dxsh](https://github.com/markm39/dxsh), and the landing site is [https://dxsh.io](https://dxsh.io) \n\nAny feedback, contributions, or thoughts are greatly appreciated!",

Columnar engines in WASM look surprisingly capable for exploratory analytics.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is the client-server communication using binary formats instead of JSON. This drastically reduces data transfer overhead, improves latency, and makes real-time analytics on large datasets much more feasible. Yet we see surprisingly few solutions implementing this—probably because it requires a shift in mindset from traditional REST/JSON pipelines and more sophisticated serialization/deserialization logic.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from data engineers who’ve experimented with this approach!",

        "content": "Hi guys! :) I hope it's the right place for this question.\nSo I have a databases and webtechnolgies exam on thursday and it's freaking me out. This is the first and probably last time I'm in touch with databases since it has absolutely nothing to do with my degree but I have to take this exam anyway. So you're taking to a noob :/\n\nI've been having my issues with normalization. I get the concept, I also kind of get what I'm supposed to do and somehow I manage to do it correctly. But I just don't understand and it freaks me out that I can normalize but don't know what I'm doing at the same time. \nSo the first normal form (english is not my mother tongue so ig thats what you'd call it in english) is to check every attribute of a table for atomicity. So I make another columns and so on. I get this one, it's easy. I think I have to do it so I avoid that there aren't many values? That's where it begins, I don't even know what one, I just do it and it's correct.  \nThen I go on and check for the second normal form. It has something to do with dependencies and keys. At this point I check the table and something in me says \"yeah girl, looks logical, do it\" and I make a second or third table so attributes that work together are in one table. Same problem, I don't know why I do it. And this is also where the struggle begins. I don't even know what I'm doing, I'm just doing it right, but I'm never doing it because I know. But it gets horrible with the third normal form. Transitive dependencies??? I don't even know what that exactly means. At this point I feel like I have to make my tables smaller and smaller and look for the minimal amount of attributes that need to be together to make sense. And I kind of get these right too ¡-¡ But I have make the most mistakes in the third form. \nBut the worst is this one way of spelling my professor uses sometimes. Something like A -> B, B -> CD or whatever.  It describes my tables and also dependencies? But I really don't get this one. We also have exercises where this spelling is the only thing given and I have to normalize only with that. I need my tables to manage this. \nMaybe you understand what I don't understand? I don't know why I exactly do it and I don't know what I actually have to look for. It freaks me out. I've been watching videos, asking ChatGPT, asking friends in my course and I just don't understand. At least I'm doing it right at some point. \n\nDo you think you can explain it to me? :(",

Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.\n* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.\n\n**Why did I even bother writing this?**\n\nI found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldn’t find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, I’ve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n**nexos.ai**\n\nQuick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.\n* Cost alert messages, so we don’t blow our budget in a week.\n* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.\n* It has an API gateway.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.\n\n**Langfuse**\n\nQuick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.\n* The A/B testing feature is awesome.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* It’s open-source, so we’ll see how it goes.\n\n**Portkey**\n\nQuick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.\n* Robust logging features.\n* Dev-centric UI.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.\n\n**Arize Phoenix**\n\nQuick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Slack alerts are super convenient.\n* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.\n\n**Overall**\n\nI feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai. It’s just all there available out of the box, with the observability, management, and guardrails menu providing the exact feature set we were looking for. \n\nClose second for me is Langfuse due to its open-source nature and good documentation coverage.",

        "author": "IntelligentNet9593",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I recently joined a small research organization (like 2-8 people) that uses several Access databases for all their administrative record keeping, mainly to store demographic info for study participants. They built a GUI in Python that interacts with these databases via SQL, and allows for new records to be made by filling out fields in a form. \n\nI have some computer science background, but I really do not know much at all about database management or SQL. I recently implemented a search engine in this GUI that displays data from our Access databases. Previously, people were sharing the same Access database files on a network drive and opening them concurrently to look up study participants and occasionally make updates. I've been reading and apparently this is very much not good practice and invites the risk for data corruption, the database files are almost always locked during the workday and the Access databases are not split into a front end and back end. \n\n  \nThis has been their workflow for about 5 years though, with thousands of records, and they haven't had any major issues. However, recently, we've been having an issue of new records being sporadically deleted/disappearing from one of the databases. It only happens in one particular database, the one connected to the GUI New Record form, and it seemingly happens randomly. If I were to make 10 new records using the form on the GUI, probably about 3 of those records might disappear despite the fact that they do immediately appear in the database right after I submit the form. \n\nI originally implemented the GUI search engine to prevent people from having the same file opened constantly, but I actually think the issue of multiple users is worse now because everyone is using the search engine and accessing data from the same file(s) more quickly and frequently than they otherwise were before. \n\nI'm sorry for the lengthy post, and if I seem unfamiliar with database fundamentals (I am). My question is, how can I best optimize their data management and workflow given these conditions? I don't think they'd be willing to migrate away from Access, and we are currently at a road block of splitting the Access files into front end and back end since it's on a network drive of a larger organization that blocks Macros, and apparently, the splitter wizard necessitates Macros. This can probably be circumvented. \n\nThe GUI search engine works so well and has made things much easier for everyone. I just want to make sure our data doesn't keep getting lost and that this is sustainable. ",

This is to make sure you understand your data in enough detail to then be able to apply data engineering steps to figure out the issue.\n\nI've gone through this process with this person multiple times now and have shown we can solve the problem in half an hour if we follow a systematic process, but the next time they need to solve a problem, they have not taken on any of the learnings. \n\nFirst question, what other approaches can I use to get this person to develop problem solving skills?\n\nSecond question, when I look for candidates to join my team, how should I test that they have good problem solving skills?",

Same for lead roles, they put more focus on ML and GenAI than the actual platform to efficiently support any data product. DE and data platform features can be built by regular SW engineers and teams now, this is what I get from various interviews with hiring managers.\n\nI have applied to a few jobs and most of them required take homes where I had to showcase my DS/ML expertise although (a) the job descriptions never mentioned anything related to ML, and (b) I clearly asked them in screening or hiring manager interviews whether they require such and claimed they didn't.\n\nAnd then I get rejected because I don't know my ML algorithms. Credentials, past experience and contributions mean nothing, even if I worked on a competitor or SaaS business that they paid for or have adjacent domain knowledge or I have built a similar DE/ML platform as they are looking for.\n\nMy post is not about the broken hiring experience, but on the field's future. I love data and its tooling but now everything has become full with GenAI; people don't care about DB/DWH/Kafka/whatever tool expertise, data quality, performance or data products you built. I also work on GenAI projects and agents, but honestly I don't see a bright future for data engineering. CTOs and VPs seem to put more emphasis on DS/ML people than DE. This was always the norm but I believe this has become more prevalent the past few years. Thoughts?",

The current architecture looks like this: I have some scheduled python jobs that scrape the data, raw data lands on S3 partitioned by hours, then data is processed and clean data lands in a Postgres DB with Timescale enabled (I'm using TigerData). Then the data is served through an API (with FastAPI) with endpoints that allow to fetch historical data etc.\n\nEverything works as expected and I had fun building it as I never worked with Timescale. However, after a month I have collected already like 1 TB of raw data (around 100 GB on timescale after compression) . Which is fine for S3, but TigerData costs will soon be unmanageable for a side project.\n\nAre there any cheap ways to serve time series data without sacrificing performance too much? For example, getting rid of the DB altogether and just store both raw and processed on S3. But I'm afraid that this will make fetching the data through the API very slow. Are there any smart ways to do this?",

We employ three Lambda functions to extract, transform, and load data in our current configuration. Step Functions manages all of this. The state machine takes all the S3 file paths that come from each Lambda and sends them to the load Lambda as a list. Each Transform Lambda can make one or more output files. The load Lambda understands exactly how to process the files since we control the order in that list and utilize environment variables to assist it understand the file roles. All of the files end up in the same S3 folder.  \nThe problem I'm having right now is that our new Glue task will produce a lot of files, and those files will need to be processed in a certain order. For instance, file1 has to be processed before file2. Right now, I'm using S3 event triggers to start the load Lambda, but S3 only fires one event per file, which messes up the order logic. To make things even worse, I can't change the load Lambda, and I want to maintain the system completely serverless and separate, which means that the Glue task shouldn't call any Lambdas directly.  \nI'm searching for suggestions on how to handle processing files in order in this kind of setup. When Glue sends many files to the same S3 folder, is there a clean, serverless technique to make sure they are in the right order?",

But I’m not satisfied just coasting by and not immediately understanding what these developers are talking about once they get really deep in the weeds. \n\n1 question I have is, my project apparently needs to use something called Informatica-QA but apparently a different project needs its server to load files for some other project. And that’s why we can’t use it to proceed with QA testing.\n\nCan I understand what is informatica-QA, the concept of its connection to a server, and why we can’t use it? B/c then how do other hundreds of projects survive if they can’t use it either? Is everyone blocked now for whatever reason?\n\nI apologize if my question is just too dumb. :(\n",

Systems bolt on triggers, changefeeds, or pub/sub layers — often at the cost of correctness, scalability, or painful race conditions.\n\nSevenDB takes a different path: reactivity is core. We extend the excellent work of DiceDB with new primitives that make subscriptions as fundamental as inserts and updates.\n\n[https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB)\n\nI'd love for you guys to have a look at this , design plan is included in the repo , mathematical proofs for determinism and correctness are in progress , would add them soon .\n\nit is far from achieved , i have just made a foundational deterministic harness and made subscriptions fundamental , but the distributed part is still in progress , i am into this full-time , so expect rapid development and iterations",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Morning everyone,\n\nLike many of you, I've been trying to properly integrate AI and coding agents into my workflow, and I keep hitting the same fundamental wall: agents call `Rscript`, creating a new process for every operation and losing all in-memory state. This breaks any real data workflow.\n\nI hit this wall hard while working in R. Trying to get an agent to help with a data analysis that took 20 minutes just to load the data was impossible. So, I built a solution, and I think the architectural pattern is interesting beyond just the R ecosystem.\n\n**My Solution: A Client-Server Model for the R Console**\n\nI built a package called `MCPR`. It runs a lightweight server inside the R process, exposing the live session on the local machine via `nanonext` sockets. An external tool, the AI agent, can then act as a client: it discovers the session, connects via JSON-RPC, and interacts with the live workspace without ever restarting it.\n\n**What this unlocks for workflows:**\n\n* **Interactive Debugging:** You can now write an external script that connects to your running R process to list variables, check a dataframe, or even generate a plot, all without stopping the main script.\n* **Human-in-the-Loop:** You can build a workflow that pauses and waits for you to connect, inspect the state, and give it the green light to continue. \n* **Feature engineering:** Chain transformations without losing intermediate steps\n\nI'm curious if you've seen or built similar things. The project is early, but if you're interested in the architecture, the code is all here:\n\n**GitHub Repo:**[https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR](https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR)\n\nI'll be in the comments to answer questions about the implementation. Thanks for letting me share this here.",

None of them really knew programming... and the guy they hired to lead it is gone. Because of that, I (and some fellow interns who are game developers) were tasked to increase the performance of the project. Naturally I inquired about their Github first and as a response I heard their Github was \"broken\". I initially thought going back a few pushes would fix it... but when I asked for more details it wasn't necessarily that their Github was broken... rather that they didn't have one.\n\nThey didn't work with Github.\n\nThe entire project was made and maintained on literally. A single. Computer.\n\nNow, I'm not a software god by any means, far from it, but I'm fairly certain Github is necessary for working with multiple people. I've learned 2 issues. The first one being that Github doesn't accept files larger than 100mb, and I'm currently learning how to work with Github Large Files to remedy that issue, as well as testing which files I can delete that won't even affect the project. However the second problem is that Github doesn't accept repositories larger than 5Gb? Mine is about 17Gb...\n\nI've already been looking up on reddit and Stackoverflow for advice but it seems that not many run into a problem like this. If anyone can share any thoughts with me would be highly appreciated.",

        "author": "LeekNecessary3190",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've been seeing this question pop up almost every day for a year and a half, and it's always the same old story… 'I'm 17, 19 years old' + 'I feel like college is a waste of money' + 'All I want is to work' + 'How do I become a developer without a degree?'\n\nLet me be honest with you: your chances are very slim. Sure, you can teach yourself everything you need in 3 to 5 years, maybe two if you push hard, and build a good portfolio. But what's your plan to find that dev job? You think you'll ace the technical interviews? Great. But how will you even get those interviews? Your CV, no matter how much you polish and fix it, will look very weak next to someone from a coding bootcamp, not to mention a CS graduate applying for the same entry-level job.\n\nLook, I get you. College is very expensive, and they won't teach you specific job-related things like Vue or Svelte. Many people, myself included, entered this field without a CS degree. But my path wasn't easy. I managed to get dev experience at a company I was already with, and that gave me the two years of experience (2 YOE) required for them to even look at my resume for my current job. And I got that first job because I had a bachelor's and master's degree in a completely different field they happened to need. Even with all that, I sent out about 250 applications, got 3 interviews, and in the end, only one offer. And that single offer came through a referral by pure luck.\n\nThe irony is that you can indeed learn all the required skills for a fraction of the cost and in less than 5 years, thanks to all the amazing online resources available. But if you're about to finish high school and haven't entered college yet, I'm honestly very surprised that some people think skipping college is the 'easy path.' You're not taking a shortcut; on the contrary, you're choosing the hardest path. You're like a salmon trying to swim upstream – a few might make it, but the vast majority won't.\n\nIf you want to gamble with your professional future, that's your decision. You can always try to go to college after you've likely struggled a lot to find your first job. The only thing you'll lose is time, and you can never get that back. I just don't understand why someone would intentionally make it harder for themselves from the start. This field is very difficult to get into.\n\nJust to be clear, this is directed at young people of typical college age who don't have major life responsibilities like children or debt. If you're older – say 26, 31, 36 – and thinking of a career change, this isn't for you. I myself am 38 and just entered this field a few years ago. For us, the calculation is different. But for the young folks, I'm telling you as a self-taught dev: this path is a meat grinder, and I absolutely do not recommend it.\n\nSome people might misunderstand me. I'm not saying you're a lesser person for not having a degree. I'm saying that HR and recruiters will likely filter out your CV and not look at it because there are stronger ones. It's all a numbers game. Imagine a single entry-level job gets 700 applications. Let's say 350 have CS degrees, 250 have bootcamp certificates, and 100 are self-taught. The hiring manager needs to pick 25 or 35 people to interview. Why would they even start with the self-taught pile? From their perspective, it's easier and safer to pull the best CVs from the people with CS degrees. It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks the 'follow your passion' advice is a scam?  \nThis is the title of an [article ](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1nihjhc/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_follow_your/)I came across recently. My opinion is that passion is important, but your education is extremely important. Don't give up your education, which will most likely qualify you for a job, for an uncertain path.  \n",

We’re doing capstone now, and if we actually pull it off, we’ll likely have an internship in a few months. Then, if I’m lucky, I’ll probably graduate—but my degree would feel useless because I honestly don’t know what to do with it.\n\nI’ve spent months overthinking what’s next after graduation. I used to love this program—especially web development, dsa with Java, database management, and digital logics—but that was during 1st and 2nd year. I lost motivation because every semester we had to shift into a totally different topic, just after I’d started enjoying the last one. I was at my peak during those years, then crashed hard when the subject switched to things that didn’t interest me, like PHP and all that.\n\nAnyway, now I feel like I’m back at zero, taking a refresher, and I’ve realized that school never really taught us how to actually apply what we learned. They just gave us small projects, and I thought I was doing great—but then I asked myself, “What’s next?” Honestly, I think I’ve learned more teaching myself and watching tutorials than I did in school. But even that hasn’t been enough, because my brain can only take so much information, and I can’t juggle multiple things at once lol.\n\nReality just hit me recently, and now I’m frantically searching for possible careers I could get into with so little knowledge and no real projects to show. Please don’t judge me—I already do enough of that myself. I just really need help and advice: what should I dooo??\n\nPeople have told me to just focus on one thing, and I did—I’ve been learning web development these past few weeks because I used to really like it. But then I see a lot of people saying beginner web developers won’t be needed anymore since AI is already as good as senior devs. Now I’m slacking again, questioning whether web development is even worth studying. I thought it would be a good starter since it’s beginner-friendly, but now I really don’t know what to doooo.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks, everyone! I'll keep your advices in mind.

We had to write our own code in that class based on established projects. I've also attempted far more complex projects based on tutorials meant to walk through nearly every step. In total, I've spent maybe 40-60 hours trying to code with C# and Java depending on the project. But to be completely honest, if you asked me to make something as simple as a calculator, I literally wouldn't even be able to tell you what the first WORD in that code would be. For some reason my brain has absorbed absolutely NOTHING about syntax or even setting up projects, and it's extraordinarily frustrating. Every tutorial or class I've ever done, I have actually been typing out all code used, and yet NOTHING sticks in my brain. I glean loose concepts, but the languages themselves leave no impression on me, and I have no idea if this is normal or not. I'm 22. If I literally can't even code \"Hello World\" for the 30th time in C# or Java because I don't remember the syntax or formatting, should I just give up trying to learn by myself (as opposed to enrolling in an in-person program)? Is coding even for me? \n\nTo clarify: I understand and have learned a lot more about how code works in those 40-60 hours. The issue is the language has no place in my brain. If I am asked to code by myself, I could tell you the general concept of what I'd need to do, and that's it. The code itself, the actual words and their order, I couldn't tell you if you put a gun to my head.",

        "content": "For context, I dived into programming as a side hobby in high school in the early 2000s. My little fun projects were text-based adventure games in C and Pascal, or drawing an analog clock with arrows on the screen, or visualising sine and cosine waves on a 3D surface.\n\nNone of that was anything remotely practical or beautiful in terms of the code. It, however, won me “nerd status” among my schoolmates and peers. According to them, I was the one that truly knew how to program. These little projects were enough to land my first programming jobs.\n\nThings seem to be quite different now. My son will soon approach the teenage period, and with the current state of the industry, I’m hesitant whether it’s worth involving him in this field.\n\nApparently, none of the average HR folks today would get impressed by a similar portfolio. You are supposed to develop an “app” just like “X”, that “solves something”, using the cloud infrastructure of a big corporation and the latest front-end framework, pushed by another corporation. This comes with a significant investment in a particular toolset, and requires heavy scaffolding, possibly assisted with LLMs. On the job market, you are not a “programmer” anymore. You are someone who is familiar with a very narrow set of tools, and need to market yourself accordingly.\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just started studying software engineering at university, but I’m feeling conflicted and unsure about the future. Most of my friends who enrolled in this program have already left, and I’m one of the few still sticking with it.\n\nHere’s my situation:\n\n* I’m 21 and just starting my degree. If all goes well, I’d finish in about 3–4 years.\n* At my university in Canada, internships are mandatory. Without them, you can’t graduate. The school provides some help, but it’s still hard to find one — for some people, it takes 6+ months or even a year.\n* I’m married, and I really want to finish as quickly as possible so I don’t make my wife wait longer than necessary.\n* On a personal note, my mother passed away this past January from a brain tumor. Before she passed, I wanted her to see me married, so I made that choice out of love for her and my wife. I know I have to carry the responsibility of that decision, but I don’t regret it.\n\nLooking ahead, I’d like to specialize in AI ,specifically deep learning and machine learning. I know that’s a path that might require pursuing a master’s degree or additional studies after my bachelor’s.\n\nAnd about passion, people often say “if you’re not passionate, switch programs.” I’d say I am passionate, but in my own way. What I really love is solving problems, whether it’s in math, physics, or programming. Coding itself is fun, but I’m not the type who will stay up all night coding just for the sake of it. For me, the thrill is in figuring out the solution.\n\nSo far, I’ve only done one or two very small side projects, and I’m starting a third one (a bit harder, I want to make a simple GPT wrapper). They’re nothing big, but I’m slowly building up.\n\nMy concern is: should I stick with software engineering?\n\nBy the time I graduate, will it still be worth it? Or is the field going to be so saturated that even with a degree and internships, finding a job will be tough?\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation,  balancing marriage, studies, and an uncertain job market? Do you think staying in software engineering is a good idea, or should I start reconsidering now before I go too far down this path?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

Because the text editor spits out the ASCII codes, it will look like gibberish. Representing the data I need stored as integers is easy. The problem is that I’m not sure how to separate different pieces of information. Let’s say variable A is an integer. Simple. Store its binary 8 bit value. Let’s say variable B is an array. Well it could be of a varied length so I need some way to tell the program when it’s reading the file that the data for this variable starts here and ends here. I can’t use any of the 256 combinations of 8 bits because they all represent numbers that the value I’m trying to store could be.\n\n**So how can I mark the beginning and end of certain pieces of data in bytes?** I’m sure this is a very basic computer science problem but I’m not proficient enough in Google-fu to find it online.",

        "content": "Hey, I’m a 2nd year Compurer Science student and my studies already take up a ton of time and energy. Most of my day is basically just me sitting behind my laptop grinding through uni work so I can keep my grades up.\n\nAt the same time, I also have the ambition to build my own projects, either to make money from programming or at least to create tools that are genuinely useful to me. The problem is I haven’t even managed to start a project yet. I struggle with discipline and time. After a full day of studying, my brain just feels fried, and at that point I usually need to do something physical instead. I’m pretty active and I love sports, so I go to MMA once a week and try to squeeze in short workouts on other days. Honestly, without sports I’d probably go crazy.\n\nAnother factor is that I still live at home. My family expects me to spend a lot of time with them, helping out aroud the hosue, hanging with my sibling, etc. I feel guilty if I ignore them, so usually when I get back from uni I end up just chilling in the living room instead of working on a personal project. On top of that, my little brother has been sick for a few years and can’t really leave the house, so he needs more of my time and energy too. I hope he gets better soon, since that would have a good impact on both our lives.\n\nI’m the type of person who really likes having structure and a routine, so part of me feels like moving out nearby could help me manage my time better. But then that also makes me feel guilty for “leaving” my family.\n\nMeanwhile, one of my classmates (and a good friend) has the same ambitions as me, but his routine is very different. After studying all day, he takes break at home, then spends the rest of the evening grinding on a personal project until he goes to bed. He basically lives on his own, doesn’t care much for sports, and spends almost all his time in front of a screen. I can see it working for him, he’s making progress and hitting his goals,  but I also suspect it’s taking a toll on his health. Still, I can’t help but compare myself to him and admire his discipline.\n\nSorry for the info dump, but I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone has advice on how to balance studies, family, health, and personal projects, I’d really appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if people got drop some project ideas or just routes i can take. I only looked into automating stuff in my live. But maybe there are far more intersting usefull and lucrative ideas (altho i doubt people would tell this one if they know it :))",

        "content": "I’m in the final year of my college, working on my project proposal. To be honest, I’ve procrastinated badly these past years and haven’t really built up much skill. It’s honestly embarrassing to admit, but after a three-year course, all I really know is just the basics of web development — HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, bit of nodejs and mongodb . Writing this makes me feel ashamed because I don’t know what I did with all this time.\n\nNow I’ve got around 8 months left before graduation. For my project idea, I was planning to build a simple web app a platform to connect local organizations, community groups, and citizens, where people could find local events, volunteering opportunities, or community updates in one place. My thought was that at least I could learn something while trying to finish this project.\n\nBut when I presented it, my teacher wasn’t impressed and honestly, I don’t blame him. Looking back, I can see the idea probably didn’t sound very impressive the way I explained it. He said:\n\nI should add AI integration. And more importantly, he told me: *“Web development is dead. You should switch to mobile development. It would be better for you. Everybody knows web dev\"*\n\nNow I’m stuck. I know I wasted so much time, but I want to at least use these last months to learn and build something. My main question is: is web development really “dead” and not worth doing anymore? Or is it still okay to stick with web dev for my project, since that’s all I know right now?",

It kinda seems that they expect that I know all of these even though that wasnt mentioned in the job offer or in my CV. Now I feel like I am not good enough for the position and therefore I wanna strengthen my skills. \n\nI already did some courses on platforms like codecademy and codedex but it is still completely different compared to real use. I know people say that I need to do my own projects but at the end of the day it is \"copying\" from AI/forums/YouTube tutorials. I couldn't do much from scratch.\n\nSo my question is: How do I get better and \"impress\" my colleagues? I know basic stuff like data types, loops, methods, OOP and other stuff but not much in detail. I am also able to read code (of things I saw) well and understand it but do it myself? Kinda hard.\n\nI would appreciate every kind of Help.\n\nBest regards!",

It felt like the right choice since it’s practical, has lots of learning resources, and can give me a good foundation before I move on to advanced topics.\n\nNow I’m a bit over halfway through, but I’ve started to lose some motivation.

After work I’m usually tired, but I push myself to learn because I enjoy coding and want to do something on my own way which keeps me motivated. Recently  though, I’ve been feeling burnt out and a little depressed, because I fear that after investing all this time, If I can not do something, I will feel lost.

I have around 2 years of professional experience (plus personal projects), and my degree is in Industrial Engineering, not CS, unfortunately.\n\nI’m currently exploring job opportunities in the EU and I live in Turkey as a EU citizen. From what I’ve seen, Go related roles are quite limited and often target senior/lead engineers (likely for teams migrating to Go). Because of this, I’m considering shifting to Java for backend work, since it seems to have a much broader job market.\n\nAt the same time, I’m also tempted by C++. There aren’t many developers specializing in low-level coding, and I feel that makes it a valuable skill in the long run. On top of that, I really enjoy thinking about systems, hardware, and OS-level concepts (not recommend assembly :) ), though I have very limited knowledge since I don’t come from a CS background. This makes me wonder if transitioning to C++ would be worth compared to Java.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences, whether it’s about job market trends, learning paths, or the trade-offs between going deeper into Go, switching to Java, or investing in C++.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Firstly, I'm tired of endlessly reading books/tutorials on languages. I switched three resources for C++. The last one was the most recommended - C++ primer, 5th edition (or whatever edition covers C++11). After authors told me about auto and decltype() in SECOND chapter, I dropped it, because... No. Just no. Why would they teach me this, if they even couldn't provide me some real-world examples of its usage? The worst thing is that I know C++'s basics, so reading any book on C++ becomes mostly a torment for me. And yet I can't just \"skip to the interesting part\", because I never know what I'm gonna miss unless I read that. :) And the most important: I'm just tired of doing nothing. Yeah, there are these little exercises in each chapter, but I wanna learn programming to make software, not to accomplish those exercises. That means, I would like to start building something as soon as possible.\n\nI have some experience in C, C++, C#, Python. The last language I used was python. Python did let me start building as soon as possible (thanks to python's docs and previous experience in C-languages). I mostly liked it, but I'm pretty sure that I don't wanna tie my life to it. I tried building a text-only roguelike with it, but I struggled with the structure. Not that I'm saying this is python's fault, just sharing what I made so far with it. I made the main game loop (fight system, basically) and classes of characters (warrior, mage, etc). Each character has max health, max mana, level, some spells and growths of health and mana with each level (like growths of attributes in DoTA 2). Stopped and decided to rewrite the whole thing, because it felt like the structure got too messy. The largest barrier in making it is import cycles existence and relations between classes.  \n\nAlso I had to work on C# for two weeks. I made a GUI calculator with it, which uses the worst but (it seems) working algorithm of evaluation. C# let me start building right away too, thanks to my previous C++ knowledge. I also found Microsoft docs really helpful. \n\nI have ~~experience~~ knowledge of old C++, which is compatible with C (raw pointers, C-strings, C-arrays, etc), and knowledge of just a few things that comes only with C++, like vectors/stacks/queues and classes (basics of all of them).\n\nFinally, I would like to provide my vision on languages that I'm interested in OR have ever tried. Note that I don't consider web at all (and even electron or whatever way to use JS for software developing). I'm not interested in it.\n\nC++: seems too low-level to just let me start building things, plus it has terrible ecosystem with all of these build systems, their generators (CMake, Meson) and unpleasant ways to get 3rd party libraries.\n\nRust: seems too low-level to just let me start building things. It does have better ecosystem, but I guess there are just no resources on it for newbies like me.\n\nC#: tied to windows... Not that I hate it, but coding on windows just feels wrong, plus I've never found something better than bare GNU Emacs when it comes to text editors, but it works fine only on native linux setup. There is .NET SDK for Linux, but... I'm not sure. I sort of can't believe that it's actually good and is being used in production, knowing what Linux to Microsoft is.\n\nJava: ...Not sure when it comes to future... I heard that there are no new projects on Java...\n\nPython: I don't see myself using it, knowing where it's being used mostly (I would like to make standalone software). Also, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be much harder to find a job because of how popular Python is.\n\nI ask you to give your views on what I should and shouldn't do and your views on the languages I listed above. Thank you!",

I'm a little more familiar with Python since I specialize in AI and had some focus on data science courses. I'm ok with Data Science technologies like R and Python but I'm not really as interested in analysing data as I am with AI. So I know where I want to go from here. I've found some things I need to focus on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but let me be honest I really am overwhelmed and lost where to go from here. There's just too many resources, frameworks, technologies and I don't know how to start from scratch.\n\nI feel like I wasted my past few years in Uni even though my GPA is decent because I usually forgot most things I learned after the course is over and never really applied it to projects. To add on, I'm just learning how to upload projects on github. I like solving problems and experimenting with AI especially back in one module I learnt on Computer Visions and Natural Language so I know I'm interested in that. So before I graduate, I really want to focus on building up skills and making projects.\n\nBut here's the problem I hate reading theory and going back over basic foundations because I already understand the basics and it's boring to do pointless tutorials on websites like FreeCodeCamp or the likes. I'm currently just starting with smaller projects like [practisepython.org](http://practisepython.org) and learning CLI projects on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but even those are not going to help me learn AI models and technologies. I'm aware I can't just jump to that without practising coding on smaller projects like what I'm doing but I would also prefer to  learn while doing some challenging projects that are not too hard but at the same time forces me to learn new things along the way. For example, I just started trying to build a chatbot using langchain documentation but even setting up the dependencies are a pain in the ass.\n\nI really want to learn and develop my AI skills before I graduate  in a very time-efficient manner so I would appreciate on any advice, tips, resources that are not theory heavy/focused or boring tutorials.

It has been wonderful and I enjoy learning about it but the problem is that I feel so lost and stupid. I have tried my hardest to understand how things works. I took the quiz and got F on it which made me feel unfit for Computer Science major. I am aware of commitment and determination but I also feel stressed whenever I try to code for myself or solve the problems (Most of my assignments are typically due in three days. My professor assign us lab for us to work on our own on Thursdays.). I am afraid of failing Computer science and the professor. To make things a bit more difficult, I can't seem to retain the information that the professor had lectured and I don't want to look away from my interpreter to just miss some information. (I have hearing loss, or in simple words, I'm deaf that have access to the sound. My community college has provided accommodations.).\n\nI don't know which flair to use but I could really use some advices. I am really terrified to fail CS and I have been interested in programming for a while but did not know where to start until the first day of CS in community college.\n\nI also have been thinking of science major (I have a strong interest in science same as computer science, but I don't want to switch the major just yet.) since it seems to be a lot easier for me due to taking a lot of chemistry classes in HS. It does sound like I am lazy.\n\nSorry for the vent or rant. This has something been on my mind and I have been talking to my friend and family but I feel like this subreddit may help me to see things differently and understand differently.\n\n  \nThank you for taking the time to read the post. :)\n\n(If this post violates to any of rules, please let me know and I will gladly to delete the post and take it to other appropriate subreddit to post on!)",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey r/learnprogramming,\n\nI've been using Rust for a while and recently finished a project that involved some interesting challenges I thought would be valuable to share, especially for those curious about using Rust with other languages.\n\n\n\n# ## The Goal\n\n\n\nIn my field (bioinformatics), there's a powerful C++ tool called `odgi` for working with complex DNA data. I wanted to use its features inside a Rust program to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency, which meant building a bridge between the two languages.\n\n\n\n# ## The Learning Journey & Key Challenges\n\n\n\nEven with experience, this project presented some great learning opportunities:\n\n1. **Tackling FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** The core of the project was making Rust and C++ talk to each other. I used the `cxx` crate, which is a fantastic tool for generating safe bindings. It was a deep dive into how to manage data and function calls across the language boundary, which is a common task in systems programming.\n2. **Designing a \"Safe\" API:** A key principle in Rust is memory safety. A big part of the design work was creating a public API that completely hides the `unsafe` FFI calls. This ensures anyone using my library can write 100% safe Rust code, a rewarding design challenge.\n3. **Complex Build Scripts:** I had to write a [`build.rs`](http://build.rs) script to compile the entire C++ `odgi` library from source before building the Rust code. It's a good reminder of how complex real-world build pipelines can get when you're integrating different ecosystems.\n\n\n\n# ## The Outcome\n\n\n\nThe result is a library (`odgi-ffi`) that other Rust developers in my field can now use as a solid foundation for their own tools.\n\n\n\n# ## Key Takeaways\n\n\n\n* **Real-world problems push your skills:** Integrating existing, complex libraries is a great way to move beyond language basics.\n* **Modern tooling makes hard problems accessible:** FFI used to be a very manual and error-prone process. Crates like `cxx` make it significantly more manageable and safe.\n\nI just wanted to share the experience in case it's helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, or about using Rust and C++ together.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Heyo. I haven't been coding very long, I know python and I've only just started learning Java. But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThis is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\n\n\\---\n\nIf current\\_frame == 1: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_1 on screen\n\nif current\\_frame ==2: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_2 on screen\n\n\\---\n\netc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.\n\nI'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.\n\nThis may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals.

Deleting all the thread of hate messages?\n\nI'm the host of a large open Narcotics Anonymous Zoom meeting and sometimes we get \"bombers\", people who join the meeting, and then raise and lower hand at a high frequency, turn their video feed to porn, and flood dump a lot of racial remarks in the chat. It does the system into chaos. \n\nAfter we eject them, we cannot delete their messages because there are so many individual messages in the message box. \n\nI don't know much about coding, I can pick it up quickly. \n\nQ: Is there something I could write on Windows that would click on each message and select \"delete\" in a couple of seconds? \n\nI'm actually at the start of a computer science degree so anything I learn now I'm sure will be beneficial.\n\nWhen I make the code, I'm going to give it to other meetings because we're not the only ones that suffer.\n\nThank you for the support!

        "content": "The creation of this app, which I called *Shared*, has been my main way of learning SwiftUI over the past months. Instead of following only tutorials, I tried to put concepts into practice by coding something that I would personally use.\n\nThrough the process, I learned a lot:\n\n* **SwiftUI fundamentals → composition**: starting with basic views, then combining them into reusable, dynamic components.\n* **State & data flow**: understanding when to use u/State, u/Binding, u/EnvironmentObject, and eventually moving toward persistence with CoreData/CloudKit.\n* **System integrations**: using the camera, importing from the photo library, and handling permissions.\n* **Privacy and sharing logic**: implementing private vs. friends-only spaces, invitations, and download options.\n* **Notifications**: experimenting with local/push notifications so participants know when new content is added.\n* **UI/UX iteration**: trying to keep the interface minimalist but functional, and optimizing performance so adding photos feels smooth.\n\nThe app itself is basically a collaborative space where groups can add photos to shared grids, create small events or checklists, and keep memories in one place. But the real outcome for me was how much I learned while building it.\n\nHere are a few screenshots and a link if anyone’s curious:\n\nFind here : [https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shared/id6748949959](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shared/id6748949959)\n\nI’m still improving it and would be glad to hear any feedback, but mainly I wanted to share how working on a concrete project really accelerated my learning compared to just reading docs or watching tutorials.",

Right now I’ve got Dependabot set up, and I usually merge updates every couple of weeks. But I’m not sure if this is really best practice.\n\nCouple of questions I’d love advice on:\n\n\t•\tHow do startups typically manage dependency updates and security risks? Do you just patch as they come in, or batch them on a schedule?\n\t•\tHow do larger enterprises do this at scale? I imagine they have dedicated teams or processes, but I’d love to understand what’s realistic as a smaller company.\n\t•\tWhat do you do when a dependency has a security vulnerability but updating it breaks other packages that rely on the older version? Do you pin it and accept the risk, fork it, patch it, or something else?\n\nI feel like I’m either over-updating (lots of noise and breakage) or under-updating (leaving security holes open). Curious to hear how others approach this balance.\n\nThanks!",

I also use IMGUI and RmlUi which has the same issue. \n```\nSDLPlatform::SDLPlatform()\n{\n\tSDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO | SDL_INIT_EVENTS);\n\tmWindow = new SDLWindow;\n}\n\nvoid SDLPlatform::init()\n{\n\t// rest of imgui setup ...\n\tImGui_ImplSDL2_InitForOpenGL(SDL_GL_GetCurrentWindow(), SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext());\n\tImGui_ImplOpenGL3_Init(\"#version 330\");\n\n\n\trendInterface = new RenderInterface_GL3;\n\tsysInterface = new SystemInterface_SDL;\n\t// rest of rmlui setup ...\n}\n\nSDLWindow::SDLWindow()\n{\n\tSDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4);\n\t...\n\n\tmWindow = SDL_CreateWindow\n\t(\n\t\t\"3D Game\",\n\t\tSDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,\n\t\t1280, 720,\n\t\tSDL_WINDOW_OPENGL | SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN | SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE\n\t);\n\n\tmContext = SDL_GL_CreateContext(mWindow);\n}\n```",

        "content": "Right now, U.S. companies spend over $161 billion every year on offshore tech services from India alone. The HIRE Act 2025 proposes a 25% tax on offshore spending, which would generate about **$40 billion** annually. Instead of disappearing overseas, that money would be reinvested here at home, funding apprenticeships, reskilling programs, and workforce training. In practice, that means more Americans getting the chance to learn in-demand tech skills, land better jobs, and actually compete for the roles that are currently being offshored.\n\nWith the new $100K H-1B fees, companies will likely push even more jobs offshore. That’s why the HIRE Act matters, it’s the only effort on the table to regulate offshoring and redirect that money into building up our own workforce.\n\nSome argue offshore engineers “aren’t prepared enough,” but that’s not really the case. Countries like Brazil, India, Poland, Ukraine, and the Philippines can have large pools of engineers trained in modern tech. Money-hungry U.S. companies keep chasing lower costs overseas instead of putting resources into developing Americans and strengthening the US economy.\n\n[HIRE Act 2025 (PDF)](https://www.moreno.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-HIRE-Act.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

I just get my work, do it, and get my weekly paycheck that is significantly higher than my full time pay was, even accounting for paying for the insurance I get through the firm. Nobody cares when I clock in and out, as long as I get my work done. There's no less job security than there was at my full time roles where rounds of layoffs would come every year at least.\n\nThis is the only job I've ever had where I am not constantly bombarded with a bunch of \"extracurricular\" bullshit that eats away at my soul and burns me out.\n\nOh yeah, perhaps most importantly: **I got the job after two interviews: a phone screen with HR and a technical discussion with my team, with no leetcode or DSA interrogation rounds.** Just a discussion of my projects and experience. \n\nI have friends who have been doing this for years and they have similar experiences to me. I feel dumb for not having tried it sooner, because I bought into the idea that it was \"lesser\" or was afraid I wouldn't have good enough health insurance.\n\nAnyway, YMMV, but just wanted to provide a counterbalance to the people who run down contract work. From what I have found it can be a very viable option.",

What really matters for hiring is personality because the company can train you in the rest.\n\nHonestly, that crushed me for a while. I lost passion for the technical side of the craft because it felt like no matter how much I built up my skills, it wouldn’t be valued if I didn’t also figure out how to communicate better or improve my personality.\n\nDoes anyone else feel discouraged by this? I’d really like to hear your thoughts.\n\nAnd when you think about it, being both technically advanced and socially skilled is actually an extremely rare and difficult combination. A good example is in the Netflix film Gran Turismo.

I’ve been working here for about a month and a half and its been pretty great; the work-life-balance is nice and the culture so far is chill. My team is developing a brand new product for the company which is pretty exciting, but that also means there’s risks.\nThe product could flop, maybe the culture shifts once its released and we are supporting client, or maybe the product gets cancelled, i get laid-off, and my resume shows me working on some zero impact project. The work is pure Java with some Vertx.\n\nA recruiter reached out to me about a role i was previously rejected on. Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:\n130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)\nThe catch is it’s 4x a week in office and currently a 30-45 minute commute to the most touristy part of the city. The company had a recent round of layoffs as well so im not sure if it’s really the much more stable apart from the product being more mature.\n\nObviously, i’d feel bad leaving a company within a few months especially one that i really like, but is it dumb to pass up such a pay raise?\n\nAny advice or additional considerations is welcome.",

You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.\n\nThere are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\n* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.\n* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.\n* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.\n* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.\n* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always “high salary” in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.\n\nI think tech gets the spotlight partly because\n\n1. It’s more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people “get” what a software engineer does\n2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those “Day in the Life” vlogs\n\nMeanwhile, most law firms or finance offices aren’t putting out lifestyle videos showing their perks\n\nCurious what others think: is it just the marketing or social media presence, or is there something unique about tech culture that makes people talk about salaries and perks more than other fields?",

At least in the US.\n\nThe unrealistic deadlines, the mismanagement of projects that then gets dumped on the devs to make up for, the work culture that comes from overseas because this field is filled with abused H1B workers. I see things eventually turning into 996 schedules in the US if this doesn't stop.\n\nThen to escape horrible jobs...you have to practice interviewing on your own free time. Interviews have rarely anything to do with what you do on the job. Thanks to all the endless technology programmers have to make up every year, good luck keeping up with everything. Also, look forward to 3-5 rounds of BS each time. Good luck finding the time to do this if you have a job you hate. I guess good luck if you run out of days to use for interviews. I guess you just have to quit your job or get fired to escape?\n\nI'm seeing a therapist but it isn't helping. They even admit that most of my problems sound like it comes from this job field. They say they have never heard of a work field in the US that is this bad from any of their clients in other fields.\n\nCan't really change job fields because I can't afford to go back to college debt now. Any job that pays a middle class lifestyle to own a basic house requires a degree these days. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I am just tired. How do I just find some peace in this field? I don't want FAANG wages. I want a descent 40 hour job that is low stress and I'm fine with low pay. As long as it pays the basic bills. One where I can just stay at the job without worrying about layoff or the next management rolling in to start turning a job into a PIP factory.\n\nIs that really too much to ask in this field?",

I’ve never caused carry over or an immediate defect since joining the team so I had no problem, and I send every question I ask since my tech lead keeps telling him I’m not technically independent.\n\nAfter two sprints, my manager was like “yeah I don’t have anything to say about this, I’ll look into what you can do to get to exceeding expectations. Make sure you’re more vocal about your accomplishments from here on out.”\n\nSo just like that, I went from being underperforming and on the verge of being let go for 7 months straight to doing fine. I guess my tech lead was overwhelming him with so much negative feedback that he thought “man, this guy must be having people straight up coding for him every sprint.” Absolutely not. My work is my own work. I never caused carry over. I do not have people code for me. I ask for help by saying what I tried first. \n\nBut this whole experience has really made me feel stressed and unstable in this position. I’m doing the work load of a senior developer with one year of experience currently, and my tech lead wants me to do that while approving pr’s (no problem) while fixing random problems with the application( problem) , while volunteering for extra work (beyond what I can do). And if I say a “bad question” this guy goes straight to my manager. What is a bad question? Whatever pisses him off after his boss gets done yelling at him apparently. \n\nEdit: oh yea, and I do technically have autofilled, easy placeholder goals. New manager didn’t know and i didn’t know, but I have performance goals like “say how you upheld company values”\n\nAnd what I get another manager? What if he isn’t a good one and just believes whatever my tech lead says? What if, while doing my senior developer workload, I end up carrying over ONE user story(now my tech lead actually has an excuse to get me fired, my manager will be the first person he messages.) \n\nAnd yes, I am going to apply for more jobs, but I’m also not vested(employer contributions to my 401k aren’t settled) until I hit the two year mark. That’s a little bit away. But this has all left me with so many questions.\n\nIs this normal? \n\nWhat just happened? \n\nShould I go all in on applying for other jobs? \n\nShould I wait to vest? \n\nDo you think I’ll get fired before I vest? \n\nIs software engineering stable long term because this feels pretty unstable for me and I want to get married and have a stable income. \n\n",

Nobody really cares whether you are working from the office or from home.\n\nBecause I felt I had started a little late, I set clear goals for myself and committed to following them with full focus. The company provides resources for learning, so I used every single one of them. On top of that I bought my own courses, set up AWS accounts, and practiced daily. I even had an old server lying around at home. I spun it up with Ubuntu and started building a homelab on weekends.\n\nExcited about my progress, I shared everything with my boss, hoping for feedback and guidance. Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as “too ambitious” and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.\n\nAt first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.\n\nMy plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.\n\nWhat I have realized is that ambition makes some people uncomfortable, but it also attracts the right kind of people who genuinely want to see you succeed. I am grateful that I found one of those people here.\n\nEdit: I have been axed. Received email. I had just put my son to school in August. :)",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "The way I learnt to code was kind of backwards. I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C. For most of my coding \"life\", I just wrote everything in asm, and then later on C but still mostly asm because I found everything else kind of confusing. I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),\n\nThis kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the \"low-level\", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.\n\nNow I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.\n\nI struggle to use git lol\n\nCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusing\n\nI struggle with database stuff\n\nI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own \"OOP\" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.\n\nGet fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shit\n\nAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool \"high level\" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.\n\nIt's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.\n\nNone of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).\n\nNone of these things are \"software\" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).\n\nTo be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.\n\nAny insights or advice is much appreciated.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm a CS and data sci double major at an average state school with an average CS dept, in my senior year. I have some internship experience, but from joke roles where I barely do anything (and barely get paid anything). The people there (and my friends) say I do good, but I don't think so. My resume has been reviewed and I'm told it looks excellent, but I feel like I blow up a lot of it and that the whole thing is this shitty cardboard Potemkin village set that'll just collapse with one nudge. Some of my resume stuff is literally just stupid ChatGPT stuff. I feel like I'm likely to fail any technical interview or OA I'm given, and while I'm actively trying to correct this, I think it's genuinely too little too late. I can barely remember a lot of the stuff I've learned a few years ago (including pre-GPT). I believe if I were where I currently am but 1 year ago, I'd actually be really cracked and have better success with internships, but now it's too late to apply to most of those.\n\nI'm realistic about my goals and don't expect to ever break into FAANG or anything of that tier in my lifetime. I knew I wasn't FAANG material since high school. But all I want is to be able to live on my own away from my shitty Asian parents. I've applied to tech roles at non-tech companies, SWE-adjacent roles rather than pure SWE, etc. On average I'm speaking with one real human per month, but as I move into full-time recruitment rather than intern recruitment, I notice signs of this slowing.\n\nI feel average no matter what I do. And in this job market, you cannot be average. I feel gravely ashamed of myself for being so average when I was smart in elementary school. (Long story but I got kicked out of middle school, which could explain my inability to succeed or be \"at the top of the pack\"). In many ways I honestly regret even majoring in CS, but I concede many other fields, e.g. the hard sciences, might've been even worse choices for me, and had I chosen those I wouldn't likely even have semi-stellar grades to brag about. And since I'm so far ahead in the game, it's literally too late to even do so. Plus my parents refuse to pay beyond 4 years of tuition and think delaying graduation is stupid (and to be honest they're probably right). When I suggested pivoting to nursing or the trades, they just laughed in my face over how poorly I'd do in those jobs (and again, they're right, I genuinely am physically weak and would struggle in those roles).\n\nIf things don't get better by next summer after I graduate, I honestly wonder if I should just spend all of my money on bus tickets to some random city in the Midwest and live on the street there. Maybe blow the rest on lottery tickets since at this point there's almost no difference. Sure beats having to shuttle to and from my crummy parents' house. I sometimes wish I could turn back time and obey my parents more so I wouldn't be in this situation, but then I realize even that wouldn't have helped.\n\nI know that ideally, this year I should be going crazy with everything, but at this point I'm saddled with so many course and other responsibilities (including some dismaying parental conflicts) that I think there's a genuine possibility that my grades could even plummet below 3.6 GPA. Also, my parents are also begging me to consider a Master's, but I really don't even know if I should do so - what if even with a Master's I fail?\n\nFor further context I'm Chinese American, have an autism dx, and grew up under a Protestant Christian background. So what should I do, and how hopeless do I seem?",

        "content": "I'm a web dev with over 10 years experience in a number of different languages, when jobs changed so did tech stack; I can give a little context to each one. \n\nC/C++: my weakest of the languages used it professionally for 8 months on a legacy backend system with many layers of contractor crap. It was my first job out of college, and it was hard I was over my head and lost in the sauce. I would say I know this language 1/10  \n  \nJava: I've worked with this on and off for a number of years, ironically always with spring framework, know it decently well in terms of usage, would need to brush up on multithreading/concurrency, have used SpringThreadExecutor in the past for big batch jobs.  I would say I know this language 8/10\n\nGolang: I've used this on and off too but not as much or as deeply as Java usually in a microservice context and didn't do any concurrent programming with it but does look a lot nice to work with in that context than the others. It's been sometime since I used this.  I would say I know this language 5/10\n\nPHP: I used this for a couple of years as old job had a monolith, I actually didn't mind this language and was really easy to pick up, no concurrency or like just a straight crud app with a LAMP stack. I would say I know this language 5/10\n\nPython: Used for some scripts, Advent of Code and leetcode job interview questions fun way to use and nice that its closest to pseudo code yeah spacing can be annoying but overall, I liked it. I would say I know this language 5 maybe 6/10\n\nJavaScript: Used it for a couple of years from what i remember it was promise chain hell, have done some stuff with it recently on a full stack node.js app but it has so much crap on top I am not a fan, I tend to almost write Java like code in Javascript. I would say I know this language 3/10\n\n  \nI really want to get a deeper knowledge of one of these languages and make it my main one, I feel almost a tie between C/Python/Golang.   \n  \nC for just sheer simplicity I'm sure it will be segfaults out the ass in the beginning but would be fun to get that low level and just be me talking to the computer's memory, then again it may break me. Could open opportunities for hardware or os programming.\n\nPython I feel fast and free with this language, just having to remember at times when func params are copied etc. Fast to work with but many others have called it slow, also nice that it's the default language of AI so very versatile.  \n  \nGolang easier use of pointers and mem management, simplified concurrency programming, I haven't done much beyond crud so hard to know just how efficient this language could be if I go a little deeper. Also seems that lots of jobs openings.\n\nSorry if this post is a little rambley I'm just out of work and wanting to enjoy programming again for fun, so just thinking aloud. If you made it this far thank you would love to hear your opinions/takes and even fun projects within each language?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Starting pay is $52k, and then I get bumped up to $62k after 6 months. \n\nOriginally when I received the offer I was excited, but now I’m re-thinking that I might be making a bad decision. \n\nThe Pros:\n\nI would be gaining experience as a software developer working with Java. Working as a software developer has always been my goal since starting my degree. \n\nIf hired with the client after the contract, I will receive a larger pay bump than the $62k.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nI would be leaving my SQL Analyst role which is very comfortable, good WLB, and has good benefits that I won’t be getting as a contractor. \n\nWith a contract, there’s always a chance you won’t get hired in or your contract ending early. The market is terrible right now and finding another software developer role would be rough.\n\nIs it a mistake to leave my Full time Analyst job, for a contract Software Developer role?",

I am currently being promoted from junior to medior, so I am not completely new.\n\nHowever, in this give or take year and a half, I have found that this job might not be for me. Constant deadlines, stress, arrogance and/or lack of care from higher management, the fact that I rarely ever get to develop, but instead endlessly maintain, bugfix or even do completely unrelated things, but also fast developing AI that I feel like is already a better developer than me, all this is causing me to absolutely dread going to work, and I wish I could just do something else.\n\nIs this normal in software engineering? I feel like a failure, studying for 6 years at uni, and after a year and a half of working, absolutely hating it. On one hand, I think \"how bad can it be, maybe I can just suffer through for the decent money\", but on the other hand, I hate my life currently. I don't need to be excited about my work, but I would like to at least not hate it, if I spend 8-9 hours daily there. I found out that I would love the idea of tech/gaming retail. Being around technology and IT, and helping/giving advice to other people. The pay, however, is not good (what is being offered is already less than what I have). What other opportunities are there? What could I focus on?",

Like Next.js, Tailwind, Zustard, React Query etc. \n\nI've ended up learning a lot more than I intended to try and make sure I can make some portfolio pieces that more closely resemble what a real app might actually be using.\n\nMy problem is that these frameworks make things easier and I am unsure if that means I am effectively missing some fundamentals because its making it easier for me, and that I should try to use them less. Or do you think it doesn't really matter?\n\nIt's kind of like the AI argument where if AI makes it all then it means I haven't really made it myself, just to a lesser extent. But it also seems silly to make it harder for myself if that's not how it would really be in an actual job.\n\nThe job listings in my area don't specifically mention what framworks/libraries they use but I wouldn't really expect them to either. And at the same time I'd be surprised if they didn't use them as well but there are also so many different frameworks and options that I feel there is a decent chance that whatever I use, wherever I eventually get a job might use completely different ones.\n\nSo my question is, should I try to keep to just kind of 'pure' React, Node, etc or do you think it doesn't really matter to be using these frameworks/libraries?",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nSome background: my mom has been dealing with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my mom’s cancer spread again last month. I’ve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.\n\nI’m a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. It’s not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but I’ve been there over a year and it’s remote so I can visit my mom and qualify for FMLA.\n\nA few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. It’s also remote, and I wouldn’t get FMLA if I needed it. \n\nI am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.\n\nI had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. \n\nI’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t now.\n\nI don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I don’t even want to try to take the assessment because I’m so overwhelmed, I’m behind at my current job and don’t have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least I’m comfortable though.\n\nI guess I’m just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter. How can I withdrawal in a way that could potentially leave the door open for future opportunities?",

        "author": "pailhead011",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’ve been working for 10 years as a software engineer and I feel stuck. \n\nI have a degree in architecture (but never worked as an architect) and I did 3d art professionally for almost 15 years prior to making the switch.\n\nI was basically aiming to become a technical artist by adding some coding skills, but overshot it, first becoming a “creative technologist” and then landing a software engineering role. \nSince then, I worked exclusively for startups, most of which folded. By the time I realized I should have been applying for big companies, the layoffs started happening. \n\nMost of my roles revolved around WebGL which feels like a really weird niche. I don’t really consider myself a graphics engineer, but I do work a lot with shaders, GPGPU stuff, can read some whitepapers and such. I have some vague understanding of how GPUs work, but not enough to understand cache coherence, never worked with geometry shaders etc. WebGL felt like a path of least resistance - there’s no need to understand compute shaders when they don’t exist. Also, what these “cloud viewers” need, usually isn’t that advanced, one can get a lot of mileage by just knowing how to write shaders and understanding what draw calls are. \n\nSo instead of growing in that direction and trying to become a bonafide graphics engineer, I thought that it would be easier and better to become a front end engineer that has some graphics chops.\n\nI’m not entirely sure if I succeed at this. I’ve had a job where I was mentoring people on react and typescript in addition to doing graphics, was making architecture decisions and such. I’ve had one where I made a Final Cut Pro clone with react. But ive also had some where I’d get laid off once the graphics need was gone, and there were other dedicated FE engineers. \n\nI think because 3D meshes may feel alien to a backend/full stack engineer, i ended up doing some computational geometry as well. But again like WebGL, what I did felt amateurish - it did the job, but was typescript, not c++ or rust. Sometimes it would run in the browser, sometimes in node, but far from using something like open cascade. As in, I wasn’t able to combine mature systems in a serious language. But I was able to implement my own half edges, quadtree and such, surgically, to solve a problem. \n\nI’d grind leetcode and do well in interviews, which is how I landed my best jobs, but this seems like it’s over now. I did poorly at an AI interview earlier this year. \n\nObviously this is all IC type of stuff, which I do like, but I’ve been exposed to different management styles. Some times it was a free for all, no code reviews, anyone can nuke the master branch, no standup, no retro, just me and my CEO sitting side by side, while our CTO is missing in action. Other times it was really anal agile for the sake of being agile. My favorite situation was when a place that lacked structure got a very good technical program manager. She introduced processes gradually, each time outlining what we were struggling with and then offering a solution. This got me interested in management in general, but I wasn’t able to really pick up much. I worked with some engineers who transitioned to managers, and they were just way more on top of these things. Worked with some that remained ICs but were still super organized. \n\n\n\nI am lucky to be employed atm and I actually really like my job. If all goes well I may just get unstuck on my own. But having been through the grinder, and since this is another startup, I may be back to where I started. \n\n\nSo, what can I do to be employable in the next ten years, even better, to thrive?\n\n\nIf I were to leverage my architectural background, how could I do that? By far the two shittiest jobs that I had were in two construction tech startups. I’m still not sure what happened there, I thought I’d bring some domain knowledge to the table, in addition to useful coding skills, it didn’t happen. \n\nIs there anything that the 3d art is good for? I feel like the ship for this has sailed 10 years ago. I had a massive imposter syndrome after my first creative technologist job. I did not reach out to my bosses friend who worked at META, and instead bent over backwards to land a job as a FE engineer. I recently saw a talk by this lady who was a UX designer there, where she says how she has no idea how she got hired there in the first place as a graphics designer. 10 years ago I met a person at a hackathon in SF, same profile - a 3d artist looking to break into tech. I don’t think they ever became a software engineer, but maybe even better - a VR evangelist for Mozilla.\n\nHow could I utilize this if at all? Go “by the way, I have an eye for color and composition”? “I can speak the same language as both your 3d artists and your engineers”? Who am I even trying to convince here, a 20yo CEO probably doesn’t care about some 3d renderings from 20 years ago no matter how good they were for the time?\n\nMaybe just pick up figma and say “look I do UX/UI too”?\n\n\nIf I were to put all my money on the IC path, what should I focus on? More graphics? More web (full stack)? Try to become an expert on rust?\n\n\nWhat about going back to school, what field would even make sense?\n\n\nSorry about the stream of consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.\n\n\nThis part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).\n\n\nI have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.\n\n\nAn additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a \"solution architect\" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal. \n\n\nSo I guess my questions are... Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? Am I crazy for contemplating how I can make it work? Any suggestions or advice in general? ",

Is this another interview, weeks after I already interviewed and accepted their offer? I wonder if they want to bomb me so they can switch the position to someone else. Why talk technical stuff with me more than a month after you gave me an offer which I accepted?\n\n**Edit**: The interview went well, and they said as much. It was kind of like a repeat of the previous inerview, I thought. I asked them about it, asked what brought this about given I already accepted the offer weeks ago. They said that it's a \"pipeline\" thing, I didn't quite follow. Something about how at that time they were gearing up for the recompete, and how we all have background checks and security clerance to be done, and basically that the purpose of this was, now that we're approaching the work for real, the get a feel for precisely where I should be on this large team. Honestly, that still doesn't quite make sense to me, because as I said this interview was almost a repeat of the last one. Why not talk to those interviewers and ask them where they think I should go? Regardless, judging from their response we should be good to go. So in short, I think it's just government contracting weirdness, I don't think they wanted to bump me off or anything like that.",

I started as a junior SWE building automation scripts and batch jobs for customer provisioning and order management flows. I liked the WLB since I worked from home most days and the hours were manageable.\n\nLast year the project I was working on ended, and I was moved into an incident manager role in the IT department of a smaller subsidiary of the company. It’s been rough and honestly taking a toll on my mental health. Most days are just nonstop incident calls with no coding to brush up on my skills. The environment is toxic and draining with constant cost cutting, shifting expectations, and heavy micromanagement from leadership. I have terrible hours and I’m expected to be on-call on weekends. Since I joined, two people were let go and now there are only three of us handling even more responsibilities. On top of that, I didn’t get a raise this year because I switched teams. My salary was above average for my area and experience, but not getting a raise really discouraged me. It's obvious they're taking advantage of the tough job market.\n\nI’ve been in my current role almost a year now and I’m ready to jump ship. I’ve been applying to jobs on and off (nearly 200) but only got one interview from a random recruiter on LinkedIn. It’s frustrating since I have 3 YoE as a dev and thought that would at least give me an edge. My old manager said transferring to another role internally would be tricky without my current team’s support.\n\nI know I got lucky during the 2021 hiring craze but I’m wondering if I’m cooked now. I would consider myself an average programmer with knowledge of basic fundamentals, I do leetcode occasionally but I don’t really have passion projects outside of work. Should I focus on side projects, certifications, start working on building my network, or maybe pivot into something like cybersecurity or data engineering? I’ve considered pursuing a master’s in AI/ML. I’d love some advice on what the smartest next steps might be.",

        "content": "Hello, \n\nI realize I might get clowned for asking this, but I do genuinely think hearing peoples' perspectives will help me.\n\nI have been working as a Software Engineer at a relatively large (for a startup) startup for 3 years now (was 22 then, am 25 now). I work on pretty low-levelled stuff with C, like Linux kernel stuff, network stuff, etc. I started as an intern right out of college making $25 an hour, but gradually moved up each year to $140,000 per year which I make now.\n\nMy team is really chill overall, and I am good friends with a good-sized portion of the team members. I do think that I have learned a lot already throughout my \\~3 years at my current role, but I know I could still learn more here if I stayed. But it would have to come from myself searching out new opportunities actively within the organization, as the work I have been getting has been kind of the same for a while, and I do feel kind of monotonous at times. However, I also fault myself for not being more proactive and asking my boss for more interesting work, I realize I've been kind of just doing whatever they needed me to do, without advocating to be given what I think would be most interesting/ best for my learning. Lastly I should mention that I do lots of work with an overseas team so sometimes I have to do late night meetings and stuff which is not exactly preferable (though I'm sure that's not necessarily something that is avoidable, and might happen at any other job).\n\nThe situation I am in is, I have just received an offer from AWS as an SDE II, at around \\~$330,000 total compensation. I wasn't really seeking it out, I just got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, and thought I'd give it a shot and see how the interview process went. And then, yeah I just kind of Forrest Gump'd to an offer. So yeah it all kind of happened sort of fast for me, so I have mixed emotions. Obviously, the money is more (though the startup I work at might get acquired, I think we do have potential offers etc., but I am not entirely sure as the management hasn't directly told us). But I am trying to decide what is best for my career. While I love my current team, I do think that I could gain a lot from expanding my horizons. And working at Amazon might also allow me to open new doors. The team I was offered to join is pretty similar to what I am doing now (systems level and network stuff). But I also would potentially have more opportunities to move around within the organization (eventually) and try new things, which is definitely not really possible with my current company. Also I think I might want to try living somewhere else some day (been in the Bay Area really my whole life) and obviously it might be easier to do that if I had other offices at my company I could go to (not really an option at my current company).\n\n  \nSo I guess I just want to hear what people would do in my shoes, it is surprisingly a little difficult to decide. I do think I know what most of you are going to say but I just thought it would be good to seek the guidance of the forefathers/foremothers, the pioneers who have walked this path before me.

        "content": "Has anyone else had job hopping imposed on them by employers? I'm jobless again and I've recently received feedback from what I suspect is an automated system that one of the things they prioritize is tenure. I think as I approach 8 years in, advance in my career, and seek more senior roles, this is going to become problematic.\n\nMy history looks like this:\n\n* Job 1 left after 1 year 6 months\n* Job 2 left after 1 year 7 months\n* Job 3 laid off after 1 year 10 months\n* Job 4 laid off after 1 year\n* Job 5 laid off after 1 year 3 months\n\nJob 3 was Twitter. I would have stayed there indefinitely if it hadn't become a train wreck and I and everyone I knew was let go. Since then each job has been a place I enjoyed but my employer makes the decision for me that me and many others can no longer work there.\n\nOn one hand I empathize with the desire for a candidate with longer tenure, but it's starting to feel rigged. I generally get good feedback from my managers and then I'm blindsided by what I assume are decisions made above them. It's a bit slow-going finding a new job after my most recent layoff and I'm wondering how much this might be holding me back. In addition to feeling quite jaded at this point, it feels rigged in the sense the industry has decided that employees are easily disposable and long term hiring decisions are not important, but they also want heavily tenured and battle-hardened engineers.\n\nI tend to get significantly above-average pay packages at these places compared to the industry median (but not necessarily compared to the company) and they have all been remote roles, so I wonder if that puts a target on my back, i.e., \"high-risk high-reward,\" but the last two companies aren't what I'd call \"big tech\". Against my better judgement I've included \"company-wide layoffs\" next to my last three roles because I worry employers might balk otherwise, but I wonder if there's anything else to be done in my situation, and what this all has cost me.",

My background is quite varied and, in some ways, a bit chaotic:\n\n- I earned a degree in political science in 2020.\n\n- I've been self-studying programming since 2020.\n\n- I work as a Python web developer in the ERP sector.\n\nI'm interested in many things in the world of IT—for example, I've self-studied by following Nand2Tetris and CS50AI. In particular, I'm focusing on cyber threat intelligence and cybersecurity because I believe they could be a meeting point between my academic and professional paths.\n\nI've seen various learning resources recommended here (like the guides on Medium by Katie Nickels and Andy Piazza, or even ArcX courses). Currently, I plan to read \"Visual Threat Intelligence\" by Thomas Roccia and use various resources like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc. I'm also enrolled in a cybersecurity program at my university (I'm European), though its focus is more on governance than technical aspects.\n\nI'm wondering, when I start looking for a job in CTI, which particularly interests me, how can I demonstrate my skills to a potential employer? I've never worked in a SOC and I come from a quite different world. What types of projects can I do on my own or with others in my free time to demonstrate competence in the field? For example, CTFs, writing blog articles, or something else? Since I know how to program, I was thinking about developing and deploying a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), but I'm not sure if that makes sense.\n\nThanks for reading this far",

The recruiter mentioned it won’t be a typical LeetCode-style interview, but rather something more practical in terms of data structures and algorithms.\n\nDoes anyone know what kind of questions I should expect? If you’ve been through this process, what did they ask you?\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
