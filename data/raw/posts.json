        "content": "In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:\n\n* Announcing they are quitting\n* Complaining they can't get a job\n* Complaining they can't do their current job\n* \"I heard DE is dead.  Source: me.  Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok.  I am 21 years old\"\n* Needing projects\n* Begging for \"tips\" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)\n* Also begging for \"tips\" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)\n* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)\n\nI thought a nice change of pace was required.  So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.\n\nAbout me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)).  Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform.  I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.\n\nMy work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager.  Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime.  Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked.  They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to.  Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.\n\nI dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom.  If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it.  Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away.  I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to).  My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.\n\nRegularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything.  Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of \"arsehole pay\" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.\n\nBefore I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:\n\n* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt.  Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions.  My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with £40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay.  The \"bad job market\" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.\n* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter.  If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with.  AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer.  Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is.  Yes, I am shaming you.\n* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better.  You don't need more courses.  You don't need guidance.  You don't need a fucking mentor.  You need discipline, motivation, and drive.  Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices.  You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.\n* If you want to keep going: then keep going.  Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are \"talented\" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is \"average\". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning.  The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal.  What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6.  What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3.  Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.\n* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you.  There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you.  We're all good at something, friends.  Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.\n\nAMA\n\nEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies.  If I suspect you are replying with an AI, you're giving me the permission to roast the fuck out of you.",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering \n\nI recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ called flash\\_hash\\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up to **2x faster** than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\\_hash\\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)\n\nThis post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.\n\n# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-Partitioned\n\nThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.\n\nThe industry-standard approach is the **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a \"divide and conquer\" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.\n\nHowever, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designed **Unpartitioned** concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.\n\nThe reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:\n\n1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.\n2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.\n\nI implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings: **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.\n\n# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for Speed\n\nWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:\n\n**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing**  \nThis is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.\n\n**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS**  \nTo allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution is **Shard Locking** (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash: lock\\_array\\[hash(key) % 2048\\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.\n\n**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator**  \nThe build-side hash table in a join has a critical property: **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: the **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly free—just a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminates malloc overhead and memory fragmentation.\n\n**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array**  \nA potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallel tag array of uint8\\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in the tag array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byte tag. Only if the tag matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.\n\n**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching**  \nThe probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I use **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to \"tell\" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process key i in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that key i+N (where N is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access:  \n\\_mm\\_prefetch((void\\*)&table\\[hash(keys\\[i+N\\])\\], \\_MM\\_HINT\\_T0);  \nWhile the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to key i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.\n\n**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing**  \nInstead of a generic library like xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions:\n\n    uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) {\n        uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB;\n        uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key);\n        return crc * ((k << 32) + 1);\n    }\n\nThe \\_mm\\_crc32\\_u32 is an **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse than xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.\n\n# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't Work\n\nNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few \"great\" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.\n\n* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensive **Gather** operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.\n* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win in **low-hit-rate** scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overhead—every key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.\n* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the \"grouping\" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe performance of flash\\_hash\\_join doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:\n\n* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.\n* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.\n* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.\n* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.\n* **Details**: Squeezing performance with tag arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.\n\nMost importantly, this entire process was **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out \"optimizations\" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.\n\nI hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.\n\nNote: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\\_efficient\\_hash\\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",

        "content": "I've been doing data things for awhile now, full-time for \\~6 years since graduating, as a full data engineer for \\`4 years. It seems every job I reach a point every year or two where motivation drops and I just don't care anymore. Performance begins to drop. When the going gets real hard I go get another job, I have climbed up to a senior role now. Fortunately this employment history of two years per organization seems to be acceptable.\n\nProblem is I am here again. Have been interviewing for roles and trying to get excited again about new projects. Interviewing for some lead roles and already have an offer to lead migration from DBT to a streaming setup. But I wonder if I'm setting myself up for failure. I do enjoy technical challenges but I do sort of feel like I am only using one side of my brain as a data engineer.\n\nAm I just burnt out and maybe need a break? I feel like even with a break the same thing would eventually come back. I don't currently have a stressful job, for example I work about 30 hours a week maybe I need to find value from other parts of life.\n\nI am also looking at going back to school for a master's to pick up some skills that would allow me to maybe work on more interesting projects (don't have the CS or engineering undergrad background, would maybe be cool to explore other technical subjects) Not thinking I'd suddenly become a game developer but I love to tinker and maybe having more fundamentals would allow me to get a personal project off the ground to the point where that could be a full-time job. I would love to have more product-focused SWE skills versus just being able to migrate DBT models to Databricks. But the downside is becoming a poor student again when I already have a career, maybe just not the one I want.\n\nAnyone who has done DE type work for longer able to comment? Are these types of low points normal, or a hint I should try to continue to find something else?",

        "author": "Then_Difficulty_5617",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on optimizing joins between two very large tables (hundreds of millions of records each) in a data lake environment. I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.\n\nBased on my research, here’s a quick summary of my understanding:\n\n* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.\n* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. It’s more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.\n\nMy main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.\n\nGiven this, I have a few questions for the community:\n\n1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?\n2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?\n3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?\n\nI'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation. Any advice or examples you can share would be a huge help! Thanks in advance.",

My goal is to keep things cohesive and easy to manage, especially for changes like adding a new column (e.g., last\\_name to a client table).\n\nCurrent setup:\n\n* DAGs: Stored in a Git repo (Azure DevOps) and synced to Airflow.\n* PySpark notebooks: Stored in Databricks Workspace, synced to Git via Databricks Repos.\n* Configs: Stored in Delta Lake tables in Databricks.\n\nThis feels a bit fragmented since I'm managing code in two environments (Git for DAGs, Databricks for notebooks). For example, adding a new column requires updating a notebook in Databricks and sometimes a DAG in Git.\n\nHow should I organize these Python files for a streamlined workflow? Should I keep both DAGs and notebooks in a single Git repo for consistency? Or is there a better approach (e.g., DBFS, Azure Blob Storage)?

        "content": "Hello folks,\n\n  \nI'm a data engineer at a tech company in Norway. We have terabytes of operational data, coming mostly from IoT devices (all internal, nothing 3rd-party dependent). Analytics and Operational departments consume this data which is - mostly - stored in Postgres and MySQL databases in AWS. \n\n  \nTale as old as time: what served really well for the past years, now is starting to slow down (queries that timeout, band-aid solutions made by the developer team to speed up queries, complex management of resources in AWS, etc). Given that the company is doing quite well and we are expanding our client base a lot, there's a need to have a more modern (or at least better-performant) architecture to serve our data needs.\n\n  \nSince no one was really familiar with modern data platforms, they hired only me (I'll be responsible for devising our modernization strategy and mapping the needed skillset for further hires - which I hope happens soon :D )\n\n  \nMy strategy is to pick one (or a few) use cases and showcase the value that having our data in Snowflake would bring to the company. Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy).\n\n  \nMy current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)\n\nMy comments / questions are  \n\\- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS?  \n\\- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified)  \n\\- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS?  \n\\- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?)  \n\n\nAny insights or comments from similar experiences are welcomed :)\n\n  \n",

I'd prefer it to be general purpose solution for everything (and ditch current setup completely) but also I'd accept it to be a solution only for critical data/calculations.\n\nThe solution should be on-premise and allow Spark computations.\n\nHow to build such a thing? We are currently thinking about Apache Ozone for storage (one baremetal cluster stretched to 3 datacenters, replication factor of 3, rack-aware setup) and 2-3 kubernetes (one for each datacenter) for Spark computations. But I am afraid our cross-datacenter network will be bottleneck. One idea to mitigate that is to force kubernetes Spark to read from Ozone nodes from its own datacenter and reach other dc only when there is no available replica in the datacenter (I have not found a way to do that in Ozone docs).\n\nWhat would you do?",

        "content": "What are folks doing to enable for super fast dashboard queries? For context, the base data on which we want to visualize metrics is about \\~5TB of metrics data daily, with 2+ years of data. The goal is to visualize to daily fidelity, with a high level of slice and dice.\n\nSo far my process has been to precompute aggregable metrics across all queryable dimensions (imagine group by date, country, category, etc), and then point something like Snowflake or Trino at it to aggregate over those aggregated partials based on the specific filters. The issue is this is still a lot of data, and sometimes these query engines are still slow (couple seconds per query), which is annoying from a user standpoint when using a dashboard.\n\nI'm wondering if it makes sense to pre-aggregate all OLAP combinations but in a more key-value oriented way, and then use Postgres hstore or Cassandra or something to just do single-record lookups. Or maybe I just need to give up on the pipe dream of sub second latency for highly dimensional slices on petabyte scale data.\n\nHas anyone had any awesome success enabling a similar use case?",

        "content": "I'm excited to share something I've been working on for the past few weeks:\n\nOtters - A minimal vector search library with powerful metadata filtering powered by an ergonomic Polars-like expressions API written in Rust!\n\nWhy I Built This\n\nIn my day-to-day work, I kept hitting the same problem. I needed vector search with sophisticated metadata filtering, but existing solutions were either,\n\n-Too bloated (full vector databases when I needed something minimal for analysis)\n-Limited in filtering capabilities\n-Had unintuitive APIs that I was not happy about.\n\nI wanted something minimal, fast, and with an API that feels natural - inspired by Polars, which I absolutely love.\n\nWhat Makes Otters Different\n\nExact Search: Perfect for small-to-medium datasets (up to ~10M vectors) where accuracy matters more than massive scale.\n\nPerformance: \n-SIMD-accelerated scoring\n-Zonemaps and Bloom filters for intelligent chunk pruning\n\nPolars-Inspired API: Write filters as simple expressions\n```\nmeta_store.query(query_vec, Metric::Cosine)\n    .meta_filter(col(\"price\").lt(100) & col(\"category\").eq(\"books\"))\n    .vec_filter(0.8, Cmp::Gt)\n    .take(10)\n    .collect()\n```\n\nThe library is in very early stages and there are tons of features that i want to add\nPython bindings, NumPy support\nSerialization and persistence\nParquet / Arrow integration\nVector quantization\netc.\n\nI'm primarily a Python/JAX/PyTorch developer, so diving into rust programming has been an incredible learning experience.\n\nIf you think this is interesting and worth your time, please give it a try.\nI welcome contributions and feedback !\n\nhttps://crates.io/crates/otters-rs\nhttps://github.com/AtharvBhat/otters",

Job hoping does not seem like an option. I've been trying for a year and a half now besides all my background. I managed to get more than 20 interviews, but they all seem to be ghost vacancies because some are active even after a year. I started to ghost interviews and recruiters past two weeks because I can't handle shitty processes anymore with 20+ hours of dedication.\n\nI am not the kind of person that just ask for money. This year I did 3 major projects that impacted the company: saved 20% of cloud costs (\\~30k per year saved). Create a new module ML related that increased our+partners  margins from 2 to 8%  (\\~ 50k year with the potential to get 3x more). Finally refactored some code that removed hidden costs/flaws in a system that relies on data and was supposed to charge partners for everything (more \\~25k). \n\nMost of those are not even 100% DE related projects. I did the same steps to reach a good quality of work in the past 3 companies regarding the DE problems.  It seems to me that most of companies don't need a ultra stack to run and don't even Big Data problems to solve. So just one orchestrator with good data validation, modeling and observability are good enough to keep everyone sleeping well at night. What I mean is that DE doesn't look like a challenge anymore so that's why I've been pivoting to more ML/Finance/backend/infra related projects.\n\nI did all these projects because I wanted, nobody asked or have the guts to push for them. I don't wanna look like the hero here, I did because I enjoy my work and also because I believe this is the way to get  a raise oc. Also other developers/DEs (thanks to all autonomy we have) seems to be in the over engineering hell or dealing with minor fire fights (not deliveryng value at all).\n\nSo I have numbers and impact but now (since beginning of the year) is not a good time for a raise they say. \n\nBut what also worries me is that:\n\nEveryone seems to be hanging and doing nothing. No projects, no follow ups (or shitty ones/same ones for 6 months), nobody in the office as much as they are suposed to be (3x week). There's no ownership at all even from the managers. I start to wonder that even managers are working o  side projects now because of their lack of presence. \n\nIs this a cultural thing here in NL? Or a moment in IT field? Or what else? Everyone seems to be pissed and without purpouse nowadays or just doing less than the basics.\n\nHow could I better navigate through this? Help me with your thoughts please.",

Does anyone have recommendations for solid (and preferably affordable) online MS programs? One that has been recommended to me for example is UC Berkeley's Online Info and Data Science program as you can get into different roles including data engineering. This one appeals a lot to me even though the cost is high because it doesn't require GRE scores or a prior CS/IT degree.\n\n  \nI understand that this can be easily looked up to see what schools are out there, but I wanted to know if there are any that the people in this thread personally recommend or don't recommend since some of the \"Past Student Feedback\" quotes on school sites can tricky.

And my teammates are now suggesting that we should run our actual Python code inside those pipelines as well.\n\nI think that this is a terrible idea due to numerous reasons, but I'm also not experienced enough to be 100% confident. So that's why I'm reaching out to you - is there something that I'm missing? Maybe it's OK to execute them in ADO Pipeline?\n\n(I know that optimally this should be run somewhere else, like a K8s cluster, but let's say that we don't have access to those resources - that's why I'm opting with just staying in crontab).",

The goal is to process retail sales data (invoices, customers, products) and make it ready for analysis.\n\nHere is what the project does:\n\n* **ETL and analysis:** Extract, transform, and analyze retail data using **pandas**. We also perform **data quality checks** in MySQL to ensure the data is clean and correct.\n* **Pipeline orchestration:** Airflow runs DAGs to automate the workflow.\n* **XCom storage:** Large pandas DataFrames are stored in **MinIO**. Airflow only keeps references, which makes it easier to pass data between tasks.\n* **Database:** MySQL stores metadata and results. It can run init scripts automatically to create tables or seed data.\n* **Metabase :** Used for simple visualization.\n\nYou can check the full project on GitHub:  \n[https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/](https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/)  \n[https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow](https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow)\n\nI built this project to explore Airflow, using object storage for XCom, and building ETL pipelines for retail data.\n\nIf you are new to this field like me, I would be happy to work together and share experience while building projects.\n\nI would also like to hear your thoughts.

I believe the advantage of Foundry is having everything ready-made, but it's also a double-edged sword since everything gets locked into the platform (besides being extremely expensive).",

        "author": "Aware_Actuator4939",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm interested in making a pivot to data engineering. Like the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kp2puy/am_i_too_old/), I'm in my 60s and plan to work until I'm 75 or so. Unlike that person, I have a background in technical support, IT services, and data processing. From 2007 to 2018, I worked as a data operator for a company that does data processing for financial services and health benefits businesses. I taught myself Python, Ruby, and PowerShell and used them to troubleshoot and repair problems with the data processing pipelines. From 2018 to 2023, I did email and chat tech support for Google Maps Platform APIs. \n\nLike literally millions of other people, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate course and started researching data careers. I think that I would prefer data engineering over data science or data analytics, but from my research, I concluded that I would need a master's degree to get into data engineering, while it would be possible to get a data analytics job with a community college degree and a good data portfolio.\n\nIn 2023, I started taking classes for a computer information technology associate's degree at my local community college. \n\nEarlier this year, though, I discovered online university WGU (Western Governors University) has bachelor's and master's degrees in data analytics. The bachelor's degree has a much better focus on data analytics than my community college degrees. The WGU data analytics [master's degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html) (MSDA) has a specialization in data engineering, which reawakened my interest in the field. \n\nI've been preparing to start at WGU to earn the [bachelor's in data analytics](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-bachelors-program.html) (BSDA), then enroll in the master's degree with data engineering specialization. Last month, WGU rolled out four degree programs in [Cloud and Network Engineering](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-network-engineering-bachelors-program.html) (General, AWS, Azure, and Cisco specializations). Since then, I've been trying to decide if I would be better off earning one of those degrees (instead of the BSDA) to prepare for the MSDA.\n\nSome of the courses in the **BS in Data Analytics (BSDA)**:\n\n* Data Management (using SQL) (3 courses)\n* Python programming (3 courses), R programming (1 course)\n* Data Wrangling\n* Data Visualization\n* Big Data Foundations\n* Cloud Foundations\n* Machine Learning, Machine Learning DevOps (1 course each)\n* Network and Security - Foundations (only 1 course)\n\nSome of the courses in the **BS in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure Specialization) (BSCNE)**:\n\n* Network and Security - Foundations (same course as above)\n* Networks (CompTIA Network+)\n* Network and Security Applications (CompTIA Security+)\n* Network Analytics and Troubleshooting\n* Python for IT Automation\n* AI for IT Automation and Security\n* Cloud Platform Solutions\n* Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Orchestration\n* Cloud and Network Security Models\n\nBesides Network+ and Security+, I would earn CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions certifications in the BSCNE degree. The BSDA degree would give me AWS Cloud Practitioner and a couple of other certifications.\n\nIf you've gotten this far - thank you! Thank you very much! \n\nAlso, I have questions:\n\n1. Would the master's in Data Analytics (Data Engineering specialization) from **WGU** be worth it for a data engineering job seeker?\n2. If so, which WGU bachelor's degree would be better preparation for the data engineering MSDA and a later data engineering role - the bachelor's in Data Analysis, or the bachelor's in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure or AWS)?",

        "content": "I’m excited to share my latest project: **PyRMap**, a lightweight R-Python bridge designed to make data exchange between R and Python faster and cleaner.\n\n*What it does:*\n\nPyRMap allows R to pass data to Python via memory-mapped files (mmap) for near-zero overhead communication. The workflow is simple:\n\n1. R writes the data to a memory-mapped binary file.\n2. Python reads the data and processes it (even running models).\n3. Results are written back to another memory-mapped file, instantly accessible by R.\n\n*Key advantages over reticulate:*\n\n* ⚡ Performance: As shown in my benchmark, for \\~1.5 GB of data, PyRMap is significantly faster than reticulate – reducing data transfer times by 40%\n\n* 🧹 Clean & maintainable code: Data is passed via shared memory, making the R and Python code more organized and decoupled (check example 8 from here - [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example\\_8\\_reticulate\\_comparation](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example_8_reticulate_comparation)). Python runs as a separate process, avoiding some of the overhead reticulate introduces.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhcpmljn1bof1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b557ef319ddb8f5ae0d2f3ea2647eb1f69bfe1\n\nCurrent limitations:\n\n* Linux-only\n* Only supports running the entire Python script, not individual function calls.\n* Intermediate results in pipelines are not yet accessible.\n\nPyRMap is also part of a bigger vision: RR, a custom R interpreter written in RPython, which I hope to launch next year.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap)\n\nWould you use a tool like this?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just started my first ever job as a junior  dev last week (fresh out of school), and honestly it already feels like a disaster. I’m starting to question myself a bit.\n\nMy first day was Monday, and by Friday I was already in home office. Same today too and Monday too. The only office days are Wednesday and Thursday, which feels a bit sad because I’m brand new and immediately working from home with barely any guidance is to much.\n\nI never really got a proper introduction to the project, the systems, or how tickets are normally solved. My very first ticket was basically: “Yo, look in our system, I have a ticket for you, try to solve it. If you have questions, ask me…” That’s it. No walkthrough, no explanation of where to start. I asked how they usually approach tickets or where to even find the relevant code, but I still felt pretty lost.\n\nTo be fair, I did get a decent intro into the running software itself, so I kind of understand the product. But that’s where it ended. Meanwhile, I see other people who started just a month before me sitting next to their team lead getting tons of explanations and support.\n\nSomehow I managed to solve 3 tickets (a mix of with and without help), but most of the time I have nothing to do. I’m just sitting here, bored, not knowing what I should be learning or focusing on.\n\nI’ve tried to be proactive and ask what I could look into:\n\nYesterday I asked if there were patterns or frameworks I should study. The response was just: “Take a look at EF and how we make the models\" EF and setting up a config for models isnt that hard so I understood it quite fast.\n\nToday I asked again and just got sent some tickets to read through “to see if I understand what the customer wants.” which is so overwhelming.\n\nAnother coworker told me to check out their validation logic cause I will be working with this part of the project, but there are a ton of files with different rules and it’s overwhelming to dig into alone at home.\n\nSo now I’m just sitting here wondering: am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to feel this lost and useless in the first week? Or did I pick the wrong career path entirely?\n\nIt’s super frustrating because I want to learn and contribute, but right now it feels like I’m just drifting.\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? Is this just how the start usually feels, or is this a red flag?",

        "author": "Viscel2al",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\\*EDIT: Title should be \"not a good **teacher\"**\n\n\n\nI hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.\n\nI just completed boot.dev's \"Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go\" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.\n\nIn the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying \"yayayayaya\", or \"boom boom\", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.\n\nI would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.\n\nSecondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \\[\\]byte instead of string.\n\nThe reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: \"Learn Go\", \"Build a Blog Aggregator in Go\" and \"Build an AI Agent in Python\". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.\n\nIn Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",

I decided to end that trial to focus on myself and learn JavaScript again, then React and Node js. My biggest problem is I don't really know when to use what I learnt. I also think that I don't know how to translate the problem to smaller problems and solve then one by one. I feel super dumb when I'm stuck on a ticket for hours, and that my colleague solve it in like 20 minutes.\n\nAfter giving you some context, my question is : when programming, how do you manage to know which key notion to use to translate the solution into code ? I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more. Also, which kind of projects I can train to test my skills once I'll finish the courses ? \n\nSorry for the bad english, it's not my main language.",

I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. \n\nWe're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The \"teachers\" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. \n\nI have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. \n\nI'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. \n\nI could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.\n\nI'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. \n\nI have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. \n\nMy life motto is \"one day or day one?\" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)\n\nI know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions 😂), that does include my peers at 42. \n\nAfter failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. \n\nNow I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. \n\nSo please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything. I will listen to those who have more experience than me.\n\n",

However, nothing ever seems to stick, I've been doing a full-stack course on Codecademy on and off but nothing seems to stick then I loose motivation for it. I enjoy using PHP and making the projects in school (and attempted ones at home) but I think it isn't used that much based on what I've read online. That's why I've been trying to learn other languages like JavaScript with Node.js. I also enjoy working with SQL databases.\n\nI guess what I'm mostly trying to ask is what is the best way to approach this blockage. I've tried using AI to help mentor me alongside the course (Not to solve just to help) but that's failed. I've tried note taking and YouTube videos as well.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the very useful ideas I didn’t expect to get this many replies. I’m gonna try some of the suggestions out for a while and see how I go.",

Like 'this' pointer is only being able to refer to the instance because the reference to an instance is baked into machine code.\n\nA) i found out 'this' pointer just passed to each function as invisible argument. Other OOP languages may work differently.\n\nM) I thought that OS is something different than machine code that regular peasants programs use\n\nA) It's same regular machine code, but It's more privileged. It has access to everything on the machine.\n\nM) The graphical interface of a programs made me think that's what programs are. \n\nA) Didn't see the true nature of programs, they consist of instructions to do computations and everything else what we call a graphical shell is merely a conveniences that are provided by Operating System software.\n\nM) I thought that GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is only device that is magically being able to draw 3D graphics.\n\nA) CPU could do the same but just really slow (no real time for demanding games), there's also integrated GPU that's built into \"processor\" but it's generally slower that dedicated ones.\n\nWhen there's no one explaining the computers from the low end to high end of course there's so much stupid assumptions and misconceptions. As a beginner coders in modern times we only start from the highest of abstractions in programming languages and only know about low end if we are curious enough. In the start of computers the programmers didn't have many high level programming languages so they knew what's going in their computers more than today's programmers.",

On the other hand, I’ve already built and implemented some fundamental data structures on my own.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Am I still considered a beginner at this stage, or somewhere in between beginner and intermediate?\n\n\n2. I also have an interest in web development, and I’m thinking of diving into that. But I also enjoyed C++ a lot. Should I keep pushing deeper into C++ (advanced topics + more DSA/algorithms) or pivot to web dev now?\n\n\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who went through a similar stage.\n\nThanks!",

I've been searching for an online coding tutor, but most of what I'm finding is either way too advanced or clearly not designed for kids.\n\nWe're not looking for a bootcamp or anything overly intense. Just someone who can meet weekly, answer questions, and guide him through projects. Ideally someone who understands how to teach younger students and keep it fun. He's already done some Scratch and Roblox Studio stuff, and he's now messing around with beginner Python and Unity.\n\nAre there good online programming tutors who actually specialize in working with kids or teens? I've seen a few platforms offering online coding tutoring, but it's hard to know what's legit. Open to individual instructors or programs just want something reliable and age-appropriate.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for online coding tutors or platforms they've used and liked, I'd really appreciate it.",

I simply want to learn as much as I can regardless of any fear or excuse. I love coding and want to do my best. I have already taken an HTML and CSS course from SuperSimpleDev on YouTube and created a couple of simple websites. It's fun and I want to continue. I wrote this to my future self so I could look back a year later and see if I had kept my promise . You will all be my witness. According to my plan I will practice every day using the \"pomodoro\" technique (50 minutes studying, 10 minutes resting every 4th \"pomodoro\", 30 minutes rest) for 12 hours. Right now I'm taking a JavaScript course on SuperSimpleDev (a very cool channel, I recommend it, there's also a course about React), after that I also want to take courses on FreecodeCamp and Odinproject on the basics of the frontend to consolidate everything, then I want to take a course on React and so on and so on . My goal is to get a full-time junior frontend job in a year even if I only get paid $100 a month, or nothing at all, it doesn't matter. I would appreciate any advice from experienced developers on how to make my learning more effective. Thank you in advance!",

At first I thought it was just a puzzle game with logic gates… but it turned out to be much more. It gave me a hands-on understanding of logic gates, memory, and even simple CPU design. Hats off to devs for making something so educational yet so enjoyable.\n\nThe game gradually pushes you from simple combinatorial circuits, to memory, to registers and to building a working CPU (LC-3 style) with your own instruction set. By the end you’re basically writing assembly for a custom ISA that you designed yourself.\n\nI’m not a computer engineer by training, but the concepts I picked up while playing \\[logic gates, adders, memory, instruction cycles and more\\] have been incredibly specific and useful later on. They gave me intuition that still helps me today as I'm trying to study C, data structures, and operating systems.\n\nIt’s obviously not a replacement for textbooks, but for me it was a fantastic way to *feel* how computers work at a very low level, and it made the transition to more formal books study way smoother.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has tried it and how far you got — did you stop at logic gates, or did you programmed your CPU?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m struggling to enjoy studying. I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.\n\nEven when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.\n\nThis year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soon\nRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.\n\nI might be spiraling \n\nMy question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost \n\nI really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nSo, for anyone with some time to spare, I need some advice about a project I'd like to realize.\n\nI would like to code a pretty simple board game - basically, one that would involve throwing a dice to move your character on some tiles with various effects, and a kind of fortune wheel. No animation besides maybe the player's pawn moving along the way. \nMultiple players of course, and if not a true multiplayer, at least a way to make a program that could have various entries and parameters set by the gamemaster.\n\nI have a tad of experience with Python, and it'd be useful for me to learn more, so that would be my fav medium if possible, along with it allowing me to make it a downloable exe file.\n\n\nAll that being said, what program/language/game engine would you recommend ? \nI looked up a few, and so far the most notable ones seem to be Pygames if I wanna do everything from scratch, or websites like Screentop or Boardgame.\n\n\n\n(Related coding question : how would you implement the different pathways a pawn can take with a given dice number ? My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement. What logic could I use to make my program give the player the option to say, with a throw of 4, go back and forth to end up on the same tile ?)\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance for your help, and have a good day !",

        "author": "FitPlantain4281",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm working on an app that essentially allows you to log things you do throughout the day. So if I wake up at 7 AM and do Yoga on September 2, then later I look at the logs for September 2, I will see that I did in fact do Yoga at 7 AM.\n\nI'm really struggling with timezones, mainly because I have it in my head that times should always be stored in UTC, and it's a headache to get working.\n\nThe standard advice is to store it in UTC and then convert to the users timezone when retrieving it, but this doesn't work here since I always want to see the log time relative to the timezone I was in at that time, not the one I'm in now (so if I was in California on September 2 when I did Yoga, then later I look at the log while I'm in New York, I still want to see that I did it at 7 AM, not that I did it 10 AM Eastern.)\n\nSo the solution I came up with is to store started\\_at and ended\\_at in UTC, and also store the timezone offsets for wherever the user was at that time, that way I can always display the correct time for the logs. However, this seems really inefficient from a database indexing perspective. 99% of the log queries on the app are for a specific calendar day according to the users location on that day. Which means looking up logs for a specific day goes from the built in database timestamp magic, to having to query every log in a 3 day range, calculate the times adjusted for the saved timezone offset of that record, and then check if the date matches. \n\nSo I also added a relative\\_start\\_date and relative\\_end\\_date to every log, which always stores whatever calendar date the log was started and finished on according to the user's timezone at that time. This way queries can easily be searched by date.\n\nThe system kind of works, but I keep second guessing if it's really the best way. It feels like a lot of work and a lot of somewhat overlapping fields (started\\_at, ended\\_at, relative\\_start\\_date, relative\\_end\\_date, start\\_time\\_zone\\_offset, end\\_time\\_zone\\_offset) just to keep track of the time. It almost feels like it would be easier to just store the calendar date and then store start\\_time and end\\_time as seconds from midnight (and maybe an optional end\\_calendar\\_date for cases when the log spans two days), but I have it in my head that this is wrong and times should always be in stored in UTC.\n\nWhat do you guys think? How would you store times in this situation? ",

This is my first time creating a web application, and so far I have create parts of the front end, and I am looking into creating lists of problems.\n\nNow, this is my first time looking into databases, and from what I have heard, SQLite and PostgreSQL are recommended the most for personal projects. I am wondering what is best for storing my problems, and its related data.\n\nSince the problems lists won't be that large, and won't be changing much, I was thinking of using SQLite, as from what I have heard it is the most simple to get up and running.\n\nNow, I have also been thinking about allowing users to create accounts on the site, and that may require the use of a more capable database, since there would be more frequent changes happening to the DB, which PostgreSQL might be better for this.\n\nLastly, I have also taken into the consideration of using both DB's, one for the problems, and the other for handling users, but I am not sure if this is a wise decision. If this is feasible, then it would allow me to focus on SQLite for the problems, and then PostgreSQL when implementing users.\n\nI was just wondering about what the best approach is, thanks in advance.",

But, I'm confused which language to choose.\n\nI'm sure that some performance critical parts may require the performance from C. However, I also believe that with how good the runtimes are currently at optimising JS/TS code, performance won't be a huge issue. Unless of course people are using it on 100 files with 1000 LOC.\n\nNow, I also know Rust partly and with my experience of programming languages, it wouldn't be an issue for me to learn Rust (the parts required) while developing the project. Same for Golang.\n\nUltimately, I want to develop it in C, but as someone currently looking for jobs and hopes that this project may get some good attraction, I'm worried that choosing C may become a problem. Finding contributors, people seeing C as not a modern language.\n\nI have the feeling that using Rust, Golang or even Zig may attract more attention to the project.\n\nI would definitely use the project for myself, but it would be good to have people be excited about it and join in it.\n\nNeed views.",

        "author": "calmstoic2000",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and you’re trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):\n\n1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).\n2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.\n3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.\n\nContext: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.\n\nQuestions I struggle with repeatedly:\n\n1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\n**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly). Or is this trial-and-error method the only way to learn?",

I started from *From Bits & Bytes to C and C++ (very nice book)*, then went through CS50, and recently I’ve been digging deeper into pointers and now into data structures.\n\nSo far I’ve been using **VS Code** for my exercises (with gcc on Ubuntu) and sometimes Vim to get more comfortable with editing from the terminal. It works fine, but since I’m about to finish the “tutorial hell” phase and start working on a few personal projects. I wanted to ask:\n\n👉 What IDE/editor setup do you find most comfortable or productive when working with C?  \nCurious how other people who are also learning C are handling this part and which materials are you finding much useful.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've read a few discussions about which degree people should go into from an interest POV, but I'm asking purely from a practical employability POV.  Some people have noted that WGU's SE degree might not be as mathematically rigorous as others, but it is ABET-accredited, which seemed to be the differentiator for Mechanical Engineers when I worked as an intern (non-ABET were essentially looked at as a liability).\n\nMy questions are: \n\n\\- Does one degree have better job prospects in this market?   \n\\- SE doesn't require much math; is it looked at in a different light because of that?  \n\\- If I stay in SE, should I list my completed math classes in the education section of my resume?  Will that be a differentiator?\n\nI'm enjoying SE, but if I can graduate earlier, that would also be great, and if they are relatively equivalent or if SE is somewhat worse, my only argument for staying in SE is that I'll be taking more classes and therefore possibly will learn more.  \n\nAny advice on that is appreciated, thanks!",

How do you become a better programmer and a better problem solver?\n\nI'm not looking only for answers like \"Read X book from Y\" (although they are appreciated), but I am looking for what changed your approach in programming, problem solving, that made you go from \"I am able to read some code, write normal/trivial functions\" to \"I can start from an idea and turn it into a functional program, with all its libraries/dependancies developed from scratch\".",

See FRED graph for the downtrend starting at that point and hasn't gone up since. Lets try to stick to the point of the post and not distract from the conversation over half a year.**\n\nAll I constantly hear in this field is \"its cyclical\" and right now is part of a cycle. I am not aware of any other cycle in tech history where the job market has been this bad for this long. Its been nearly 4 years now of a horrible job market and it is only getting worse it seems.\n\nFRED data shows too that right now job posting are as bad if not worse than the worst part of the pandemic, when hardly anyone was hiring. That doesn't factor in all the new games that are being played, like posting of ghost jobs. Factor in that, and it is probably way worse.\n\nAlso, jobs on the broader market just got revised down by almost a 1 million jobs today. Meaning, they overestimated the amount of jobs created by close to 1 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, companies \"still can't find qualified candidates\" and we continue to approve more and more visas in the US for mainly tech jobs. Nevermind the massive trend of now shipping jobs overseas or nearshore. Nevermind too the AI going on as well. Yes, I realize that much of the AI stuff is overhyped, but this sub is in denial if they think that hasn't affected hiring trends as well.\n\nI'm sorry, what is this jobs market anymore?

        "content": "I need a serious reality check. I just got an offer as a New Grad Cloud Engineer at a startup in Chicago Suburb for $62,000 base pay.\n\nI was pretty shocked by the number. To give you the full picture, when they asked for my salary expectations, I said around $130k base pay. Their response was that I was asking for a **FAANG senior level base pay**. A friend of mine told me something similar, too.\n\nBut everything I've seen online (Levels.fyi, Blind, etc.) shows new grad tech roles in the $110k-$150k range. Now I'm completely confused. Was I living in an illusion thinking that number was achievable? Or is $62k a major lowball, even for a new startup in Chicago?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone in the tech scene. Thanks.\n\nEdit - Location is Chicago Suburb  \nEdit - Masters new grad, and they will be sponsoring, if that makes a difference\n\nEdit - Thanks everyone for the helpful advice. I'm reading all the replies. Apologies that I can't respond to everyone.\n\nEdit (Sep 11) - They revised their offer to a 6-month, $30/hr contract due to budget limits. For now I took on the offer and back to job hunt 😭.  \nMy colleague suggested that the company views me as highly skilled and because they can't meet my pay expectations they worry I might quit in the short term so offered contract for now.   \nThey will convert me if they have enough budget in future.",

Admittedly, I didn't spend that whole time looking, but much of it I have been applying, interviewing, talking to recruiters, reaching out to friends, networking on linkedin, emailing people that are recommended to me, adding projects to my portfolio. I have been doing this constantly on a weekly basis for months. Nothing. I haven't even sniffed an offer. 95% of the time I just get rejection emails. Many of these positions I am 100% qualified for, literally every single thing on the bullet points is something I have experience in and is on my resume. I know I am qualified. I know that I did good work at my last job. I know I am smart... right?\n\nLately I have been feeling like a complete and utter failure. Applying to jobs feels pointless since I never hear anything back. Even applying to similar positions to the one I left at the end of 2024 I get rejected for. Do I just forget my degree and go work as a waiter? Surely there are jobs out there but clearly no company wants to take me. I tend to think of myself as a capable and intelligent person with a good work ethic, but trying to find a job and watching my savings dwindle away has made me feel like I am worth nothing.\n\nI don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess to vent. Maybe other people can understand my situation. I worked really hard to get my mental health to a good point over the last 5 years or so but lately I feel it slipping.

        "author": "d_wilson123",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground.  I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer.  Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers.  As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go.  However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer.  [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people.  This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.]  Here is some of my experiences.\n\nWorking at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out.  A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is.  My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer.  If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows.  These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:\n\n\n**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs.  I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves.  We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.\n\n\n**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD.  My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff.  The cluster was owned and operated by someone else.  But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services.  There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.\n\n\n**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out.  There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box.  But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves.  This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.\n\n\n**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer.  My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team.  At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else.  Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included.  The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales.  But not everything was managed.  So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points.  This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time.  Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.\n\n\n**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job.  So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as \"How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?\" were complete unknowns.  We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch.  Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly.  They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options.  So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down.  So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that.  My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.\n\n\n**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company.  But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding.  The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it \"just worked\" without having to think about it too terribly much.\n\n\nThis is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice.  If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it.  My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go.  However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform.  I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now.  It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",

I was one of the first juniors the company ever hired, and they didn’t really have the time/resources to support me. Other juniors struggled too, and seniors were too busy with their own projects to help. Onboarding and documentation were bad. I felt like I was set up to fail from the start.\n\nThat said, I survived almost a year (11 months) and learned a ton. I owned several projects as the only engineer, got exposure across the stack, did support rotations, and even participated in code reviews.\n\nNow I’m trying to figure out my next steps. How do I explain being fired without it killing my chances in interviews? Should I target FAANG/big companies (where I’ve heard junior support is stronger), or focus on smaller companies? Any other tips for someone in my situation?\n\nI don’t want this one rough experience to define my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙏",

        "author": "paynoattn",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Original text:**  \nWas interviewing a candidate today, she is from India (not my choice) - EDIT: SEE BELOW FOR WHAT I MEANT HERE. She has solid experience 5 years. We're trying to fill a full stack .net and angular role (once again, not my choice). We had three sessions - get to know you, framework and language knowledge, and then LC easy (13 - Roman numeral to integer) with screen sharing.  She seems really stiff and nervous, but literally answers every question 100% accurately.\n\nFor the knowledge section it would usually take her a couple stabs and seconds of silence to get to the right / correct answer.\n\nMe: \"What is the best data structure for storing 10 million records in memory?\" Her: \"A list or array but for that many records I think you should use a dictionary.\"  \nMe: \"How would you handle a sql query that takes 30 seconds to return?\"  \nHer: \"blah blah blah, pagination, blah blah blah.\" (in a follow up questions she finally got to indexes\"  \nMe: \"What's SOLID\"  \nHer: \\*literally lists of the entire acronym correctly with what it means\\*\n\nI'm really skeptical at this point she either has notes, or is using chatgpt on another monitor. I'm personally fine with this, because I find it pretty easy to sus out and honestly only do this section because it's required by our HR department (I told them I wanted to do a single 2 hour long session with two LCs and a live project collaboration and skip the knowledge check and they were like \"no, that's not how we do it.\" >(ভ⤙ ভ \")<).\n\nThen we get to the LC. I share her a fiddle with the LC and tell her can use Visual Studio, or VS Code, or the fiddle - up to her. I tell her getting the solution isn't the important part - being able to explain her logic and thought process is. She then stumbles around with Visual Studio for like 3 minutes trying to create a solution, then switches to VS code - copies the fiddle into a FUCKING JAVASCRIPT FILE AND PROCEEDS TO RAW DOG THE C# WITHOUT SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN A JAVASCRIPT FILE. IN COMPLETE AWKWARD SILENCE TOO lol. I am floored. Is this cheating? Is she that nervous?\n\nBut the problem with the cheating scenario is I can see her working through the problem like I would. I.e. first create a method to iterate the string and break it into chars, then a method where she used a switch to get the int value, then she put the check for the previous char is less than in a static method, etc.\n\nAt the end, once again in complete fucking silence, she just dumps her javascript c# bastard child into the fiddle, runs it and gets the correct answer. I am so speechless at this. I ask her to explain her solution, which she does a decent job at and explains the business logic pretty well, then we drop from the interview.\n\nI use this same LC easy for pretty much every interview, and I literally have never seen such unhinged behavior in my life. My gut is telling me she just hates interviewing, but is secretly an interviewing chad and has done a TON of prep - but I also am out of the interviewee game - I haven't interviewed for a position since before COVID. Tell me, fellow gamers, is the cheating tech that good that it will tell you specifically how to fake reasoning out a solution? Or is it also giving nervousness / awkardness to you guys?\n\n**Edit**: I am leaving the original post body as to not receive criticism of secrecy. In my statement about the interviewee, I say \"*she is from India (not my choice)*\". What I meant by this is to say, I have no control over this decision - and to show that simplistic suggestions as \"just interview in person,\" won't work. Yes my company has an office in India that they could interview at, but there is nobody on my team or my boss' team that could do that for us. All five of my team leads are in N / S America. We do have employees on my team there, but they are all mid level. This is a senior role. I have in the past asked for support from other teams for this, but have been either ignored or told there isn't resources to support it.\n\nI personally fully support companies hiring everywhere in the world and employees being able to work everywhere in the world, at a good salary with no exploitation and nobody losing their jobs to accomplish this. Some of the best engineers I have ever worked with are Indian, both from collaborating across the world or as H1B on the path to green card and citizenship in the US. 🇮🇳 ❤️\n\nAlso, for this role, we cannot hire anywhere but in India as it is part of our companies expense budget for India. We are filling an open role from somebody who was already in India when I became manager of the team, who left some time ago. I can't go more into detail due to HR/Compliance reasons.\n\nI could have explained all of this above, yes, but I was already writing a really long post and wanted to just get to the point without detracting from it with a long winded explanation nobody could have wanted. Well here is the long winded explanation several have asked for.\n\nIf you felt my comments about the interviewees ethnicity or national origin were offensive or mean - I apologize.\n\nAlso for those that are wondering why I said (*once again, not my choice*) for .net / angular - yeah I fucking hate that shit. Eat 💩 angular team and microsoft. /s - .net isnt as bad as PHP. angular isnt as bad as jquery was. \\*\\*shudders\\*\\*",

        "content": "Hey all, \n\nI've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. \n\nNot saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.\n\nFrom my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. \n\nOn the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more \"pass/fail\" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. \n\nI think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.\n\nBasically two styles: \"textbooker\"  who want puzzle masters, vs. \"collaborative\" who prioritize discussion and personality.\n\nAnd don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others. \n\nAnyone else notice this trend? How do you handle it?",

        "author": "btzmacin",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a senior engineer (12 YOE), and a friend of the family's kid is a recent grad who, naturally, hasn't been able to land a job, given he didn't do any internships before graduating.  His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.\n\nMy plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market.  He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.\n\nI think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky.  Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.\n\nEven making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it.  If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.\n\nWhile applying, I'd have him come up with a product.  It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating.  What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience.  To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow.  Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.\n\nIf he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper.  Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one.  Automate tasks at work with and without AI.\n\nDid I miss anything, or is anything above way off base?  I don't want to scare the kid, but at the same time, this market is horrendous for seniors...I can't imagine having nothing but coursework on my resume right now.",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI am currently getting a degree in computer science. I originally got a bachelors in a different field not related to it. I went back to school and the advisor recommended I do a MS in CS. The issue is that I am having trouble getting into the work field and looking for entry level positions. I have been practicing on coding, learning new material related to computer networks and infrastructure. I am genuinely trying my hardest to get into but seems a lot of positions into Data Analysts positions, AI roles, and cloud computing are not looking for entry-levels workers and so I’ve been in a rut. I think that maybe I am looking in the wrong direction or looking for a needle in a haystack. What can I do to build my portfolio, make myself marketable and wedge my foot into the door? I am very determined and motivated to get into this field. Any advice is greatly appreciated and welcomed. Thanks.",

        "author": "spurkle",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m an early-career frontend developer, and I’ve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.\n\nFirst, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.\n\nApparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:\n\n* Massive 2k+ LOC React components\n* Misuse of Context API for basically everything\n* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on \"mode\" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.\n* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent\n* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)\n* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.\n\nHonestly, it’s just incredibly bad.\n\nI also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:\n\n* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic\n* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: \"Internal server error\" })` \\- lol\n* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)\n* No pagination in a logistics app\n* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.\n* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction\n* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)\n* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebase\n\nSo, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.\n\nI’m considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I don’t have a formal CS degree, I’m worried about how it’ll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I don’t want to feel stuck in this mess forever.\n\nSo my questions:\n\n1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?\n2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?\n3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase?\n\n  \nEdit: Is the industry really in such bad shape? How come software engineers are paid so well when so many overlook even the basics?",

Unique to this role includes high amounts of travel. It's also riding the AI bubble so if that pops it would impact this company's perceived value and ability to get customers.\n\nI might work like hell, get laid off in 6 months, have a resume that looks like shit?

        "author": "L3av3NoTrac3s",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?\n\nFrustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.\n\nQA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.\n\nPlanning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.\n\nArchitecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.\n\nFor example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.\n\nI’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. I’ll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of “no it’s not” or “prove it”… so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told “stop being too technical”. Basically they don’t trust me when I tell them something is problematic, and then still don’t understand when I show the code causing the issue. It’s a no-win situation.\n\n\n1:1 with the tech lead who said basically “we don’t need to worry about good principles because we can rewrite the whole app in a month if we really had to, just chill out and stop worrying, the company isn’t really affected.” I disagree wholeheartedly, I think our performance has the ability to kill the company by destroying our customer’s trust from the sheer amount of bugs and misrepresented data in the product.",

        "author": "theploop",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.\nI’ve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.\nA friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.\nI did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.\nFor context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.\nSo my questions are:\n• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?\n• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?\n• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?\nWould love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",

I've indicated that I'm very interested in the position, however I'm worried I may have been a bit too eager in showing my interest as the salary of the position wasn't disclosed, would require that I change from full-remote to hybrid, and the company is generally known for giving lackluster at best raises/promotions. I'm already on the lower end of the payscale for my current role, so I have a feeling they're going to try lowballing me on the salary extra hard for the new position by just offering like a 15% bump (for reference the low end of the band for the new role in my area on glassdoor/indeed is more like a 40-50% bump compared to my current salary), which I feel wouldn't be worth it at all when taking into account the additional responsibilities, costs of commuting, and degraded work/life balance. Assuming that the company does lowball me and isn't willing to budge, how would you guys recommend I handle things? Respectfully decline the position despite previously showing great interest in it and take this as a sign to start looking for a new position, or just grit my teeth and accept the lowball offer and try to leverage the new title to get a new job somewhere offering a salary and benefits more in line with what appears to be industry standard after 3-6 months in the new role?",

I have no idea where to even begin picking up any of this.\n\nI feel completely inadequate for a Middle position elsewhere, and applying for Junior positions is impossible. Pay is ass, but nonetheless better than what I’d be getting elsewhere that is available to me skill-wise. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I can see myself 5 years from now with the same level of knowledge as I do now, and I don’t know what can even be done about this.",

        "author": "LooWillRueThisDay",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated with my CS degree 2 years ago. My first year after graduating I was unable to find a job relevant to my degree, but after some job jumping I landed a role as a consultant at a small CRM company. After 6 months there, I landed a role as an Implementation Consultant at a much larger and reputable company where I'll be making 75k (CAD, as I am in Canada). I will be starting this upcoming week.\n\nWhile I'm elated to get this opportunity, I have so much imposter syndrome. In a world where jobs that pay 55k have 4 rounds of interviews, this role just had a recruiter call and a 30-minute interview with my hiring manager's manager (the director). My hiring manager was supposed to be on the interview as well but was unable to make it. Next thing you know, I had an offer and the salary is about 15k more than I expected.\n\nThis isn't the same type of Implementation Consultant role that exists at most companies. The job description is more like that of a Business Systems Analyst, but I'll be doing work for clients who are implementing our software. There are separate roles for consultants that do the scoping, so I'll just be doing the implementation work.\n\nThe director did mention that I'd be using SQL and would also be writing scripts in C#. In all honesty, I don't know what I'll be using both for. I was honest and said I haven't used SQL since school, but said I should be fine since I know how to work with relational databases from my last role at the CRM company (albeit it wasn’t SQL). Regarding C#, I was also honest and said I don't know it, but I've written scripts in other languages, and he said I can probably pick it up quickly since I have a Computer Science background. But I haven't coded in almost 2 years, and coding in a corporate environment seems very different from coding small Python projects where I mainly used ChatGPT.\n\nDo you guys have any tips? Honestly, my last role left me with very poor professional confidence. I was on my way out at my last company since I couldn't handle the workload and was very lucky to land this new gig. The difference is that at my last company, we didn't have dedicated project managers and requirement gatherers—it was all me. However, the director was honest with me and said they are very busy right now and the work environment is intense, so I'm not sure if my stress will be any better at this new role even though I won't be responsible for scoping and project management. Also, based on LinkedIn, I've noticed that all my new colleagues have almost 10 years+ experience as Systems Analysts, most of them are senior consultants. There are no juniors, just regular consultants and senior consultants.\n\nRight now, the only thing I know I have to do is set proper expectations with my manager when I start, especially since he wasn’t a part of the hiring process.\n",

I have started to dislike development work and wanted to pivot away from it. I'm not really sure at the moment what I want to do, but had an interest in trying for an infra / ops role.\n\nI somehow managed to stumble upon and receive an offer for a \"Cloud Engineer\" position. Upon learning more about the position the role and research, the role seems to be like a Platform Engineer. Essentially I would be working on the company's Internal Developer Portal (IDP) powered by Backstage helping to research new developer tooling, supporting new pipelines, and helping to modernize and onboard applications teams to the platform. I believe another term for this would be building out a \"low code\" internal cloud platform\n\nI have no connections that have experience working with IDPs so wanted to take a shot in the dark and seek out any engineers in this area of work or have worked adjacently with it and ask the following questions:\n\n1. Am I pigeonholing myself to a certain niche in this kind of role? How applicable does work in this kind of position apply to other DevOps roles?\n2. In your experience how difficult has it been getting application teams to transition to this kind of platform?\n3. Is this an upcoming way of approaching and accelerating enterprise app deployment or has this been a relatively niche approach to maintaining infrastructure and operations that only certain companies pilot?\n\nAny help on this would be appreciated as I have literally never seen this sort of position even within my current company.",

I have extensive Python experience from both my research and teaching: my PhD project involved simulating large networks of neurons entirely in Python, and I also taught a simulation based physics course in Python.\n\nI'm currently building basic skills through Codecademy (SQL, Pandas, machine learning, etc.) and have started applying to jobs, even though my portfolio is mostly just my PhD projects so far. My plan had been to complete the Codecademy professional certifications (Data Scientist: ML Specialist and Analytics Specialist), but I'm wondering if a more recognized credential like the \"IBM Data Science Professional Certificate\" or something else would be better.\n\nPut simply, I'm not sure whether I'm approaching this in the best way. I'd love advice on:\n\n\\- how to express the value of my PhD experience in applications/interviews\n\n\\- whether certifications like Codecademy or IBM are worth pursuing\n\n\\- any strategies for building a portfolio as someone coming from academia\n\nIf you or someone you know has made a transition like this one, I'd be grateful for any guidance you can share. Thank you!",

I enjoy both areas (software, hardware, and everything in between), so the only question is which one offers better work prospects? Also, if you did any of these what college did you go to (I'm still looking for colleges so I'd like to know some ppl's experiences). Thanks!",

        "content": "I have 15 years leading cloud, web, and mobile projects, mostly as a consultant and 1099 contractor. Recently I also worked on LLM API integrations (co-founder of a small LLM platform before stepping away).\n\nWith the market being what it is, I am leaning on my network and trying to figure out how best to differentiate. The main question: **do I dig in, or pivot for better opportunities (if they exist)?**\n\nPossible paths I am considering:\n- Continuing as a boutique consultant (agency site, marketing, outreach, network)\n- Project management contracting\n- Cloud infrastructure (expanding beyond my \"basic\" web dev cloud skills)\n- Data and integrations (SQL migrations, automation, jobs)\n- Database administration\n- LLM integrations, prototyping, and rollouts\n- Fractional CTO work\n- Building my own app (riskier, longer-term)\n- Learning new skills (data science, AI/ML, advanced LLM work)\n\nStrengths: breaking down processes, managing international teams, delivering client projects. I've been all about \"delivery\" the last 15 years.\n\n**Looking for feedback on:**  \n- Which of these skills are most marketable for contracting right now?\n- Whether to pivot, stay broad, or narrow focus?\n- Best entry points into strong contracting opportunities?\n\nI am open to different engagement styles:\n- Short-term spikes (up to 80 hours/week)\n- Seasonal contracts (3–9 months at 40 hours/week)\n- Ongoing \"fractional\" work (5–20 hours/week/client)\n\nThoughts from staffing folks, recruiters, or experienced devs are welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** 15 yrs US-based consultant (cloud/web/mobile + some LLM work). Market is weird, debating whether to double down on current path or pivot. Considering PM, infra, data/integrations, DBA, LLM integrations, fractional CTO, or new skills. Looking for feedback on most marketable paths for contractors, and best ways to land solid opportunities.",

I programming, and troubleshooting PLC, SCADA, ROBOTOTICS. \n\nDuring my studies, i took courses of programming,  OOP, Algorithms, and Data structures. I really enjoyed those courses . I was very good at C++, Python, Java script basically over all logic building. \n\nI want to switch to a computer science job now. What field would you suggest that will be good for me to get into at this point.  I am a fast learner. Alot of my past class fellows have already switched to a CS based careers because of poor Electrical job market in my country. They are working in app development, web development amd cybersecurity. \n\nSo what CS based career do you think i should go into. \n\nYour opinion will help me alot in my decision.  Thank you very much. ",

        "content": "I'm curious about this because I realized that probably 80% of my coding is calling an existing class that exists in the codebase to do something.  \n\nAn example of this would be that there is a de facto \"Send Email\" class that someone wrote years ago. This class does all the work (updates tables, generates the PDF, calls the web API, etc), all I really do is feed it the string for the body of the email.   \n\nEven when I am creating new processes, it is mostly just sticking together these already existing classes. It would be inefficient and increase risks of introducing bugs to the codebase if I tried to create a different Send Email class for my process.   \n\nIt kind of makes me feel like less of a software engineer and more like I am just writing glue to fit these already existing puzzle pieces together.",
