        "content": "I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nWhy are companies acting like jerks?\n\nLast week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”\n\nSeriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?\n\nHere’s what I’ve noticed:\n\n* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.\n* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.\n* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.\n* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.\n\nDo you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?\n\nI’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\n\n\\-----\n\n\\[EDIT\\]\n\nI'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",

        "content": "TLDR: Is there any reason *not* to use primary keys in your data warehouse? Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?\n\nMaybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as \"table stakes\" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was \"Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that.\" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?\n\nI think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:\n\n* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.\n* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.\n* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \\`join\\` logic from being repeated in multiple places.\n   * Not to mention general \\`join\\` efficiency\n* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \\`join\\`s should work.\n\nI'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.\n\nFull disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all. But I'll certainly give credit to all you r/dataengineers.",

        "content": "hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.\n\n# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.\n\nYour work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.\n\nLLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.\n\nSo the danger isn’t the model.  \n**It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.**  \nOr their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.”  \nOr a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.\n\nYou won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.”  \n  \nThe next few years look the same:  \nIndustry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning—  \nStill out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.\n\n# How you can win this fight\n\n  \nRight now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.\n\nThe most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.\n\nIt’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago.  \nAnd now it’s your turn.\n\nYou don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.\n\n**Be the scout.**  \nThe one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. \n\nIt’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…”  \n→ Yes, and let’s do it safely.  \n→ Yes, and let’s make the most of it.  \n→ Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.\n\nBut “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” \"falling behind\" \"missed opportunity\" \"company risk\". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.\n\nSo don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.\n\nFrame it as:  \n**“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**\n\nThat’s who companies want.  \nThat’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in.  \n  \nAnd while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps you guys keep your jobs.",

I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came. That’s part of why I’m leaving: the pressure has become too much.\n\nHere’s the complication:\n\nI made the decision to accept a new job the day before I left for a long-planned vacation.\n\nMy new role starts right after my trip, so I’ll be giving my notice during my vacation, meaning 1/4th of my two weeks will be PTO.\n\nI didn’t plan it like this. It’s just unfortunate timing.\n\n\nI genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.\n\nHas anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?\n\nHow did you propose it?\n\nDid you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?\n\nDo you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?\n\nIs this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?\n\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.\n\n\n",

Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.\n\nThat's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.\n\nNow the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.\n\nIt's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.\n\nRant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.\n\nTLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything\n",

Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.\n\nFor example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.\n\nThey would create \n\n* the User entity\n* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)\n* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the two\n\nAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.\n\nDo you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.\n\nI understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.\n\nTheir progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",

This means you should be using MERGE or INSERT OVERWRITE 100% of the time. Some older databases don’t allow this, in which case you should TRUNCATE/DELETE first and then INSERT INTO. Or you should do INSERT INTO ON CONFLICT UPDATE. \n\nWhat other features of SQL are present but should be rarely used?\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nI need some honest guidance from the community.\n\nI was previously working at a service-based MNC and had been trying hard to switch into a more data-focused role. After a lot of effort, I got an offer from a known consulting company. The role was labeled as Data Engineer, and it sounded like the kind of step up I had been looking for — better tools, better projects, and a brand name that looked solid on paper.\n\nFast forward ~9 months, and honestly, I regret the move almost every single day.\nThere’s barely any actual engineering work. The focus is all on meeting strict client deadlines (which company usually promise to clients), crafting stories, and building slide decks. All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. \nThere’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.\n\nTo make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.\n\n\nFor context, my background is:\n\n•\t~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)\n\n•\t~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks\n\n•\tComfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)\n\nI joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here. I feel more like a delivery robot than an engineer.\n\nWould love some advice:\n\n•\tAre there companies that actually value hands-on data engineering and learning?\n\n•\tHas anyone else experienced this after moving into consulting?\n\nAppreciate any tips, advices, or even relatable experiences.",

In there, we have resources that are spin up by business analysts, data analysts and project managers. There is no clear traceability for the resources as they weren’t deployed using iaac and instead directly on aws console, just imagine a crazy amount of resources like S3, EC2, Lambdas all deployed in silos with no code base to trace them to projects. The only traceable ones are those that are deployed by the data engineering team. \n\nMy question is, how should we be dealing with the clean up for this environment before we commence with the set up of data warehouse? Do we still give access to the different parties or we should revoke their access to govern and control our warehouse? This has been giving me a big headache when I see all sorts of resources, from production to pet projects to trial and error things in our cloud environment.  ",

Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.\n\nHowever, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view. Today, counting a year and a half of internship, I'm going on three and a half years in data engineering.\n\nAnyway, what do you think?",

        "author": "Past_University_7144",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I come from a self taught background, and have been in my F200 “Data engineer” role for about a year. I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.\n\nThen through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.\n\nFast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:\n\n- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team\n- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design\n- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud\n    - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos\n- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting\n- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasks\n\nNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.\n\nI guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated. I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who has felt out of their depth in early-ish career.",

        "content": "TL;DR  \nWe’re in the parking industry, running Talend Open Studio + PostgreSQL + shell scripts (all self-hosted). It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.\n\nFiguring out:\n\n* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation\n* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant\n* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\n\n\\---\n\nHey all!\n\nWe’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.\n\n# Current setup:\n\n* PostgreSQL (\\~80–100GB per customer, growing \\~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area\n* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)\n* Shell scripts for orchestration\n* Tableau Server\n* ETL approach\n* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat files\n\nWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.\n\n# Why we’re moving on:\n\nTalend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.\n\nAdditionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.\n\nWe have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.\n\nWe’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words \"modern this, cloud that\", etc...  \nBut we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.\n\nWe’re trying to build something that:\n\n* Actually works for our use case\n* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible\n* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant\n* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire\n\n# Our modernization idea:\n\n* Python + PySpark for pipelines\n* ELT instead of ETL\n* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one\n* Airflow for orchestration\n* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical\n* Great Expectations for data validation\n* Vault for secrets\n* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment\n* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging\n* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.\n\nAll self-hosted and open-source (for now).\n\n# The big question: architecture\n\nStill not sure whether to go:\n\n* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)\n* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)\n\nOur sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.\n\nI believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a \"product\" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.\n\n# Questions for the community:\n\n* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?\n* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?\n* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?\n* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?\n* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?\n* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?\n\nWe’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.\n\nAppreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights. \n\nCheers!",

The issue is, there’s no open row-oriented data format that lets you use any query engine - Postgres, MySQL, etc. - on the same data directly.The challenge of designing such a format is obvious, and it would take tremendous effort to get mainstream databases to adopt it. The bigger question is: is there even strong demand for such a format?

We ingest data into the bronze layer from a wide variety of sources: APIs, Excel files, third-party applications, etc. Because of this diversity, we struggle with establishing consistent naming conventions.\n\nFor example, many datasets don’t have a straightforward business concept like `CustomerSales` or `OrderDetails`. Some are operational logs, others are reference datasets or ad hoc data pulls. This makes it hard to define a universal naming strategy.\n\nIn the gold layer, we use standard prefixes like `dim_` and `fact_` where applicable, but we often have tables that don’t neatly fall into dimension or fact categories. These are still critical to downstream consumption but are harder to categorize and name.\n\nI'm looking for:\n\n* Examples of naming conventions you’ve successfully applied in medallion architectures.\n* Resources or documentation that helped your organization design naming standards.\n* Tips for balancing flexibility and consistency when working with heterogeneous data sources.\n\nAny advice or pointers would be appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance.",

I decided to roll my own instead of using an existing one like Pandera / dataframely because I found that all the features I needed were scattered across several different existing validation libraries. At minimum, I wanted something lightweight (no Pydantic / minimal dependencies), DataFrame-agnostic, and that has a very flexible API for custom checks.

        "content": "**TLDR:**\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).\n\nRegarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:\n\n* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.\n* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.\n* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.\n\nHugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).\n\nThis is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nBit of a newbie question for all you veterans.\n\nWe're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.\n\nSo far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.\n\nThat said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?\n\nCurious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",

Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).\nData in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. \n\nPrimarily, the changes that we want to track are: \n1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time 🥲)\n2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)\n3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)\n4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. \n\nTo do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. \n\nThis what I tried so far:\n1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/\"expectations\";\n2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). \n3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. \n\nAm I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described? Or is the market really overloaded with stuff that says that it does everything, while in fact does do squat?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.\n\n1. \n\n>Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change \"atomic\" within a single transaction.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as \"RUN\", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.\n\nWhat is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations?  \nI do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK.   \nLogically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?\n\n2. \n\nI am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers.  \nThat is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct?\n\n    databaseChangeLog:\n      - changeSet:\n          id: periods-log-trigger\n          author: XYZ\n          runOnChange: true\n          changes:\n            - sqlFile:\n                path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql\n            - sqlFile:\n                path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql\n          rollback:\n            - sql:\n                sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()\n\n\n\n3. \n\nBack to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.\n\nBecause createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is  dropped?\n\nThanks everyone!",

        "content": "Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.\n\nI'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.\n\nTo give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.\n\nNow, about the two offers:\n\nOn one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.\n\nHowever, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.\n\nThe second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of \"Data Scientist Analyst\", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.\n\nThe positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.\n\nThat’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.\n\nSo I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.\n\nAgain, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",

I want to have sql query code review and strict policies on how to design reports. Code review being one of them. We also have analysts write Python scripts that connect to db, write code with logic and then load back into sql database. Again no version control there. It’s really the Wild West.

        "author": "Boltonet12",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve \"weekly\" or \"monthly\" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it? Either way can someone give me some educational texts to support your opinions for this scenario?",

A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. \n\nOur app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.\n\nWe'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.\n\nWe've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).\n\nBefore we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.\n\nFor more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

Fetch data, store as raw json in some kind of identifiable way, eg. Hive partitioned folders or filenames comprised of dimensions.\n2. Do some transformation/aggregation, store in partitioned parquet files.\n3. Push to more available database for API to query.\n\nI'm finding it tricky with this kind of data though, as I can't really partition or store the json in an identifiable way given the number of dimensions, without making a lot of partitions. Even if I could, I'd also be making a parquet file per request, which would also add up quickly and slow things down. I could just put this data directly into an sql database and not backup the json, but I'd like to keep everything if possible.\n\nI want the app to function well, but I also want to teach myself best practices when working with this kind of data.\n\nAm I going about this all wrong? I'm more of a full stack dev than a data engineer, so I'm probably missing something fundamental. I've explored delta tables, but that still leaves me with a lot of small .parquet files and the delta table would effectively be the raw json anyway at that point.

        "content": "Now, I may be biased because I'm all for learning to code, but holy Christ the amount of times that I have given AI a chance, it has done nothing but hurt me emotionally. I have NO IDEA how those \"no-code\" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.\n\nSo, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. \"Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each <li> element in it's own little border side-by side\". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each <li> element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. \"They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code\". I paste the supposedly \"corrected code\" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, \"Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version\", and it's not the correct version.\n\nAnother example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of \"seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?\" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating. How does someone who knows NOTHING do this and not go crazy?",

Now I almost completely abandon AI and study everything using Internet resources and open courses.\n\nI want to become a Fullstack developer. learn JavaScript (and JavaScript frameworks (React/Vue/Bootstrap)), learn how to use Node.js, Python, etc. for the Backend.

        "content": "I have been using Codefinity for a few weeks and wanted to share my honest review. Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.\n\n\n\nThat said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.\n\n\n\nJust to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.\n\n\n\nI’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time. Did you find that the content goes beyond beginner level and really builds useful skills? Do you think it’s worth continuing with, or are there better platforms out there for someone looking to grow step by step? I would appreciate hearing your experiences. Thanks!",

How can people argue like this when there are literally thousands of conflicting opinions online about what should be **basic** OOP stuff?\n\nIn math, you have a **clear** definition. In geometry, you have **clear** definitions of theorems, axioms, and so on. But in programming? Everything feels so vague, like I’m in a philosophy or theology lecture, not studying a field where precision should be the highest priority.\n\nSeriously — **where’s the original source of truth** for this?

I recently dropped my major to a minor despite having only 2 classes left due to the sheer amount of stress it put on me and also not fitting in the box that the department wants me to fit in. At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies. For the record, I am self-taught, and of course there are gaps in my knowledge, but should anyone really care what tools I use or what I do and don't know so long as my own goals are reached? I'm more than willing to learn specific langs, frameworks, or concepts if it means I understand how to tackle a problem better, even if not in a lecture hall trying not to gouge my eyes out from sheer boredom. To be fair, I also freelance, but even still, I absolutely despite making things for the primary purpose of making a profit. Am I rambling or writing a word salad? Probably, I'm a little sleepy right now.\n\nTL;DR I like to play with my toys in my sandbox after building them, and I will never understand the culture that if you're wanting to do CS, you better want a job, because apparently people who just do it as a passion or hobby are seen as less valuable or don't have a place in the field (at least that's how I perceive it).

I really want to help my family out as soon as I can.\n\nBut yeah, I just don’t know what I should be doing right now to actually get closer to that.

I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities.  \nThe reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans.

I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost.

I'm a procrastinator but I try so hard to improve myself and still get misunderstood a lot by my parents. I want to show them I'm not 'worthless' and 'dumb'. I've only learnt C language at high school. I want to do something in these spare months that I got. I love gaming but I've never code before, I don't know where shall I start. Python? I have no idea, I'm just a newbie. I'm a digital artist and can actually draw pretty well, this was one of the major reasons I thought of becoming a game developer because I love story telling games. I just needed a small advice if anyone can guide me what should I start with. I'd be very grateful for your advice.",

        "author": "mosahel",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello,\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, I started with programming and all this tech stuff at the very beginning of 2024. I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.\n\n\n\nThen I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.\n\n\n\nI’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.\n\n\n\nSo now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.\n\n\n\nRight now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects? I really want to make the most of this last year so I don’t end up with no job at the end, but I could use some advice—even just on what to learn, what order to tackle things, or how to structure my study time.\n\n\n\nIf anyone’s been in a similar situation, or has tips for making the most of this final stretch—whether it’s about Java, backend projects, passing those backlogs, or handling the stress of not knowing what’s next—I’d really appreciate any guidance.\n\n\n\nThank you!",

Oversimplified, my System uses fire science equations, a grid representing terrain, and some custom graph traversal algorithms to predict how a fire spreads across different terrain under different conditions, allowing the user to select a starting position and fire-start position to start the simulation. I posted it on LinkedIn but like, nobody really cared enough to actually look at it and give me feedback lol.\n\nI'm hoping I'd find people here willing to critique it. I am not planning on building it out again, my next step is a multi-agent disaster response simulation, but I feel like any advice on how I could have made this project better would help me in the long run\n\nThank you!",

        "content": "Hey guys!\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to sincerely thank all of you for taking your time to read and respond to my post - your help truly means a lot to me!\n\nLet me start by telling a bit about myself; I'm currently a junior Data Engineer, working in a firm based in the EU - the first job I've ever had since graduating with my bachelor's last summer. I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.\n\nOver this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.\n\nThe stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.\n\nI won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.\n\nThat said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.\n\nSo now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:\n\nWhat books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a \"cracked developer\"? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.\n\nThrough this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.\n\nAs I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I've been programming for around 2-3 years and I'm currently doing Linux Kernel programming at my internship.\n\nThe way i started CS (and fell in love with it) was by self-studying Berkeley's CS61a in my senior year of high school. I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.\n\nMy 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:\n\nFirst, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.\n\nHow does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. \n\nFor those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS? I only know of my journey so I'm curious to hear about others.\n\nThanks",

Long story short: Yes, it's super easy and great for prototyping but I simply can't stand the syntax and some other features. Probably too settled down in C-like languages.\n\nHowever, I still want to learn something new. Just for the sake of learning tbh.  \nSince I'll (probably) stick with some personal CLI tools for automation and simple tasks I don't need languages with sophisticated GUI or ML support.  \nCode should be running with little to no effort on both, Windows and Linux (MacOS is nice to have, but not a must)\n\nMy first idea was to check out Go, since it's syntax and overall featureset seems appealing to me. Same goes for Rust although the borrow-checker is... \"something different\"\n\nQuestion now:  \nDo you have any input on why to go (or not go) whith the one or other language? Might something be more suited for my purposes? Any pros and cons that I might be missing?",

For some reason though I had this idea in my brain that seemed reasonable enough but I later found out was wrong in some aspects. This idea of mine was that different programing languages are used for different uses because they are better for those specific things. There were problems in my head though with that because I had never seen anyone use python for things like UI and yet a quite common library exists just for that. (Tkinter) I dismissed this as probably someone's collage project that was purely theoretical. Something like how people put doom on calculators. It is not really a feasible option but is just used to say 'we did it'. Later I met an engineer who works with testing equipment for ultrasound devices. The UI he programed was with python. I was so surprised about it because now I think I might have been living under a rock. I later learned about other things like pygame and such but I am still confused. *If programming languages can step out of the 'natural boundaries' of what they were made to be cappapble of doing, then why don't we just use simple languages like python for every use?*",

Requesting any and all help you guys can provide:\n\n**Backend:** Python FastAPI  \n**Frontend:** Flutter  \n**User Authentication:** Firebase  \n**IDE:** Android Studio\n\n**Problem Statement:** Our app will be used with a combination of Unique Mobile Number and Unique Email ID, which will create a Unique User ID (through Firebase). We want to make the app as such, that it **CANNOT** be accessed on more than one device wrt to the following conditions:\n\n1. App cannot be used at once on more than one device\n2. If user logs in from an unknown device (not the one it was registered on), then the app's main functionality will be disabled and only view mode will exist\n\nTo solve this, we did create a logic for generating Device ID, which will help us associate the User + Primary Device combination, but in turn ran into another problem:  \n*The device ID does not stay consistent and changes with Uninstall/Reinstall/Software Updates/etc.*\n\n***I cannot attach any images here, please text me for the exact scenarios, but here's an example:***  \nUSER A DEVICE ID ON DEVICE A - 96142fa5-6973-4bf5-8fe8-669ec50f7dc5  \nUSER B DEVICE ID ON DEVICE B - 02f81a46-13a6-4b19-a0d6-77a2f8dc95eb\n\nUSER A DEVICE ID ON DEVICE B - 02f81a46-13a6-4b19-a0d6-77a2f8dc95eb (ID MISMATCH = DISABLE PARSER)  \nUSER B DEVICE ID ON DEVICE A - 96142fa5-6973-4bf5-8fe8-669ec50f7dc5 (ID MISMATCH = DISABLE PARSER)\n\nUSER B DEVICE ID AFTER REINSTALL - fe77779a-3e1d-4ac4-b4d0-b380b1af98a7 (ID MISMATCH - ASK USER FOR VERIFICATION)\n\nIt would be of immense help if someone who has worked a similar issue could guide us on how to take this forward!\n\nIf there's any cooperation needed in seeing the code or having a quick call to discuss further, I'm more than willing to.\n\nThanks reddit!",

        "content": "**Hi all,**\n\n25/M UK – I’ve been working as a self-employed joiner for the past five years, but about four months ago, I gave it up to pursue a career in programming. (This didn’t come as a shock to my friends, family, or me.)\n\nSince then, I’ve been educating myself, completing _The Odin Project_ and working on several small personal projects. I enrolled in the Open University a while ago and am set to start a 2 year software development course in October.\n\nWhere I need your guidance is this: given the current state of education, I’m struggling to figure out whether university is really the best option. Frankly, I see a lot of UK university education as BS (subject dependent, of course). I saw this with joinery courses in my late teens, which led me to skip further education in that field and instead take a minimum wage job. I slowly but surely worked my way into full-time self-employment with decent pay. That turned out to be the right choice for me at the time.\n\nAnother caveat: While I’ll receive student finance for tuition, I’ll need to support myself alongside studying by working in hospitality most days and weekends. (The scope and grind of this doesn’t faze me as I know people who have done this before.)\n\nThere’s a part of me that thinks a better option might be to get a low-paid tech job (since it’s related) and continue educating myself over the next two years. The goal would be to build a strong portfolio and eventually transition into programming full time.\n\n**NOT programming is NOT an option.**\n\nSo I ask you all:\n\n- How feasible is my second option?\n    \n- Do you think the courses currently available are a waste of time and money?\n    \n- What would you do in the same situation?\n    \n\nKind regards,  \nSome lurker who has never posted to Reddit before",

So, for example, if I input the letter \"b\", I want an output animation that shows the vertical line of the \"b\" being drawn from top to bottom, then the circle of the \"b\" being drawn clockwise. See, for example, the animation [here](https://www.kanshudo.com/blog/kanji-animations) for the kind of effect I want to achieve.\n\nI'm aware that this means I might have to specify how each glyph of a certain font should be animated individually and so on, but I'm still lost on how best to do it. Surely the creators of these kanji animations did it line-by-line rather than frame-by-frame. But, if I'm honest, I don't know the first thing about how TTFs work or how to output animation in any reasonable format. Can anyone advise? Any sensible language is fine. Thanks.",

I also want to create a simple backend that collects reports about scammy websites and gives each site a kind of “trust score” based on how many users flagged it.

This is my way of learning by doing, and I’d be grateful for any help.\n\nIf anyone has resources, beginner-friendly guides, or thoughts on how I could actually make the detection/warning parts work in a real browser extension, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**TL;DR**: I’m a beginner learning JavaScript & web dev, trying to build a browser extension (SafeSign++) to warn users in real-time about scams and phishing.

I am starting to make plans now as it is summer, and it would be great to get input from those with more experience than me, or those that made potential mistakes that I might be heading towards, to see avenues which I am still unaware of. \n\n",

        "author": "Yung_Carrot",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*\n\nI always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)\n\nI do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.\n\nAs for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.\n\nI did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.\n\nThe first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.\n\nFor context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nOf course, this is just one data point. YMMV\n\nTo those still hunting, good luck.",

Absolutely wrong mentality to have if you want to be good\n* **No passion**, people that go through bootcamps are just in it for a job.

But from a quality standpoint these are the best hires. Bootcampers are never like this. They also have 0 curiosity, things like learning the codebase is implied! But because bootcampers don't care they don't do this.\n* **Spoonfeeding**, A part of being a good developer is resourcefulness, strong debugging, googling skills, and just figuring it out. If you know, you know. Especially with the massive resources online. Even before AI. A bootcamper can't do this, they need to actually be taught and spoon feed everything. Why do you think they paid for a bootcamp for info that can be found online for free!

I have a lot of fear with AI & such, & my biggest goal with SWE is to get better… so I can job hop with confidence or know my future will be ok no matter the company I choose. \n\nIf you are in a similar boat of being someone who knew nothing about coding when majoring in CS, to now working as a SWE, & later, being good at it, can you share your story, your path? Things you did to get better that worked in specific detail? \n\nI so deeply crave the satisfaction of getting better at my job. Doing better. Growing. Being valuable. I have contemplated joining the military at 26 so i can have a bit of job & life security, & im a SWE. Not a good feeling. Anything helps. ",

In terms of job availability and security -- I have searched for jobs online and it seems like we're still in a crappy job market for tech jobs. I mostly see senior, architect, and consultant jobs.\n\n\\- Why are Salesforce salaries so high? I'm still in shock and awe at how much a Salesforce Dev can make -- it's comparable to traditional software engineering roles. I still have a hard time believing it, it's so wild.\n\n\\- Are certifications actually as valuable as they say? I do like that Salesforce has created an upward mobility ladder, in a sense, for their platform. Which is unheard of other than with your typical IT certs like Cisco and such.\n\n\\- Has anyone else switched from a traditional software development job and into Salesforce?

Since then, I’ve been actively applying to jobs across different types of companies including startups, large firms, remote, on-site and hybrid roles. Despite sending out around 50-70 applications a day, I rarely hear back. Ive even been reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, and barely anything.\n\nI’ve revised my resume countless times. I’ve learned Spring Boot and am currently working on a backend project to showcase that. I also practice LeetCode daily.\n\nOut of desperation, I joined mthree in June, which is supposed to be a training-to-placement program, but they haven’t started training me yet. Feels like a waste of my time.\n\nAtp I feel like im doomed and unemployable. I've applied for QA, support, SWE, data scientist, even HR and solutions engineer. I just dont get it.\n\nFor context, I’m applying throughout the U.S. and a bit in Canada (dual citizen).\n\nWhat the hell do I even pivot into atp? Ive already tried applying for adjacent tech roles.\n\nEdit 1: Since people are commenting on the 50-70 jobs, I know 50-70 sounds intense but I apply to jobs in both Canada and USA. I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to. I also avoid easy apply and apply directly on sites.\n\nEdit 2: Here is my resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adhrvKm0kb0D_pN9hHNyOuiS30Tti5w/view?usp=sharing\n\nSome comments regarding my resume:\nMy resume is a simple Word document. I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.\n\n\nEdit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:\n1. Contribute to open-source projects\n2. Bold technologies in projects/internships\n3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)\n4. Get rid of mthree experience\n5. Reduce technical skills\n6. Remove GPA\n7. Stick to applying locally and not country-wide or cross country because they will filter you out.",

I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long. The following day I'm told I need to only do my job title, then the next week she said I stopped programming and need to figure out how to do both.\n\nLast week, I was asked to meet with the new HR person who has been firing 2-3 people a week since she started. When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks.

But he cannot do anything about it. \n\nA few weeks ago we had our first two day long off-site. Ngl he acted like a high school bully to me and a number of other people. It got so bad that our VP of product told him he was being an asshole. \n\nOn Wednesday I have been informed I will be having my first 1on1 with our VP of engineering. \n\n- should I bring up Bob or will it sound too whiney?\n- any tips?\n\n",

I practice algorithm problems, I practice system stuff, and follow everything recommended and it simply is not enough. My experience isn't enough. It is endless demands. They want you to basically be a unicorn and robot who has no life outside this industry.\n\nI have to code in a specific language they want in these remote question sessions. It used to be that you could pick any language. \n\nThen they ask you the most specific questions about said language that no one needs to know or memorize to be good at their job. Since you don't know there trivia questions though, you fail. \n\nAt this point, I'm just at a lose. I am already doing everything I should be doing and that shows at not enough anymore.

Never struggled to find a job (only had 3 software dev jobs in my 20 years career so far though).\n\nI have been at my current company for 10 years now. I asked for a significant raise once about 5 years ago because I realized I was paid less than a colleague even though I was the lead. Other than that I usually get the usual 3% salary bump every year, nothing significant.\n\nIdeally I would prefer to stay at my job. I like the job, my coworkers and the company.  But it's always a challenge to know I could be making that much more (and they also offer 2 more weeks of vacation per year) elsewhere. Both jobs are 100% remote, so no change there.\n\nSo basically my question is, what is the norm out there? Is it \"too much\" to ask for a significant salary raise again if I asked for one (and got it) 5 years ago?",

No dedicated time for learning, or interval sprint for learning, yet there are hours of learning requirements that basically end up requiring overtime to get done.\n\n2. short \"technical onboarding program\" was not useful for what i'm doing on my team\n\n3. Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small  team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. \n\n4. Disorganized leadership. \"everyone in the department do the same amount of points\"(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.\n\n5. Seemingly little interest in growing me as a professional or if I even like it here. Getting 60 bucks for a bus ticket to a tech event required a whole written document. Not a lot of social opportunities and I have no time too anyways. Asked to be in specialized training programs for cloud skills and got ghosted as usual. Main focus is how I can use gen ai to do more of their work.\n\n6.Still have no goals in workday. Don't know if I'm doing well or not and am afraid to ask at this point. But bright side is I'm learning a LOT, do work with aws, and do code every day. \n\nIs this all just normal and should I kinda suck it up and stick with it or would I most likely just be better off somewhere else?\n\nI can’t switch teams or managers.\n\nEDIT:,\n\noh yeah this is important but I never wanted to do software dev my entire life. I’m getting an mba. Technical leadership is my goal at the moment. I just want a tech basis first, that’s why I have certs in ai and the cloud. I just want to be able to grow in a place that is optimal for my growth and doesn’t like, burn me out.",

I ended up working in technical presales (very strong focus on AI Platform) for 1.5 years and realized having a sales-oriented role is not really my thing, and I was risking building a career that could only lead to commercial roles, so I decided to look for software engineer openings internally and externally.\n\nFound an opening for A DIFFERENT big tech role in AI software engineering (based in EU, Eastern Europe) and decided to pursue that opportunity. I am quite happy with my choice, but most of the managers discussed this choice with are telling me that AI will come to replace many SWEs and I need to consider this, as if they're saying 'you messed up with this one'.\nI mean, they're people that do not really come from engineering and spent their life in salesy roles but these words combined with the gloomy outlook I'm seeing here online have me concerned that I should have just swallowed my dislike for business talks and stick to my already privileged position, even if it's not aligned to my liking and the career path I imagine myself pursuing.\n\nWhat do you think?

In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. \n\nTwo months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. \n\nVery recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. \n\nI went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally.  But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description.  It is very not palatable, I feel that I am an object, and honestly this smells of misogyny.",

I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.\n\nI doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",

A little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in CS and I graduated in 2021. I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now.  I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.\n\nI was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.\n\nWhere do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry? Trying to decide between focusing on statistics/data analysis using Python, PowerBI, Tableau, etc versus learning full-stack development with Java as backend and Javascript for front-end? Any input or advice is appreciated, thank you :)",

This is my first permanent job after completing my master’s degree.\n\nInitially, I was welcomed on and had a really great time getting to know people and contribute, and my performance review was “exceeds all expectations” from everyone on my team. My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.\n\nFast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. \n\nEX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of  “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”\n\nFirst, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.\n\nI’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. \n\nI do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone. \n\nMy goal here is to simply prevent this type of rhetoric from hurting my career and reputation.\n\nI’m seeking advice on how to handle this situation. Just let it go and roll with the punches, defend myself in the moment, discuss this with someone higher up, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Where did you go, and how did it work out?\n\nAny recommendations or insights would be very appreciated!",

I've read that infra teams tend to give more scope than product teams for senior engineers who are looking to be promoted to staff. However, how is career progression from junior to senior? Will it be slow due to there being many tenured folks? Talking to some of the folks, they said that the team is harder than other teams to onboard onto because of the technical complexity. I feel like working on an infra team as a new grad is a rare opportunity but I am also hesitant on career progression even though a new grad on the team did make it to senior in 5 years.\n\nAny input would be appreciated :)\n\nEdit: I work on cloud infrastructure.

I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years.  \nI love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education.  \nHowever, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities.  \nThe reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.\n\nSo I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.\n\nTL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

They have concrete plans for upgrading to modern .NET, but it won't be so soon (around 3 years)\n- CI CD pipeline using old ass tech, with plenty of environment issues (this has caused me and the team a lot of headaches and time wasted). Not containerised, but plans to be. Modernizations in this area are in the plan as well\n- Not a huge app, around 10 microservices\n- Hosted on AWS but not cloud native, still traditional server architecture\n- Not much scalability concerns\n- However, the product is highly secure and must pass stringent pentests. So plenty of security concerns\n- I get to work with and do the modernization, anything from code to infra migrations. Manager is highly supportive of any effort in this area\n- I get to touch on all areas of the albeit old application, from frontend to backend to devops and security\n- only one team of devs+QA of around 15 people\n\n\nWhat I will miss out on:\n- Scalability concerns. The product is meant to be low key b2b, there are basic scalability concerns but not big tech level where scalability is top priority.\n- Cloud native infra: I'm seeing most companies have already left the server architecture behind and adopt cloud native.\n- It feels bad still using Remote Desktop Connection and windows sucks major ass\n- Modern devops\n- Modern tech\n- Large company things with the big tech feel. I can't put this exactly into words but when your company has an engineering blog there is just this vibe. I feel like I'm missing out.\n\nI'd like to know if my concerns are legit. Thanks!",

So I am seeking opinions!\n\nFor some background, I graduated with my bachelors in chemical engineering with a minor in CS. I am now working as an automation engineer making $100k.\n\nI've always been interested in doing more with CS. I need to program from time to time at my current job, but I haven't had to do \"true\" programming for a while. I'd like to break more into the programming/software side of my industry (or I'd even be interested in a stereotypical software engineering role), but I feel like I am way out of practice at this point, or at least wouldn't know enough to qualify for that kind of position. I also feel like having some official degree in computer science would make me feel more \"legitimate\" when it comes to applying to future jobs.\n\nObviously this would be a big commitment in terms of time/money, but I feel like it could be worth it in the long run? Does anyone have any thoughts, opinions, or experience breaking into a more software engineering role after getting a BS in a different field? Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I am looking at online masters programs that I would be able to do part-time while keeping my full-time job like Georgia Tech's OMSCS or UPenn's MCIT",

No cover letters or personalized messages.\n* Step 1 was typically vetting call from recruiter or an intro from a founder.\n* Step 2 was typically a technical assessment or take home project.\n* Step 3 was typically a culture fit or technical discussion (eg. system design).\n* Step 4 was typically an onsite (culture fit, system design, problem solving).\n\nSome reflections:\n\n* There is a new wave of AI startup funding, which provides opportunities for people who are willing to learn quickly.\n* I'm a builder. My chances were significantly higher if there was a take home project involved.\n* Startups almost never ask LeetCode problems directly.\n* If startups really like you in one way, they can look past your weaknesses in other areas.\n* Startups hire quickly. If you vibe well and pass everything, an offer can made very quickly.\n\nMy advice for anyone interested in working in the startup space for this new AI wave of funding, especially from non-traditional backgrounds:\n\n* Try to build your own company. This is literally the saying, \"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.\" This immediately shows culture alignment. They are looking for people who have tolerated high risk situations.\n* Practice system design, especially the problem: \"If you're given 10,000 PDF documents, how do you build a chatbot to answer questions about these documents?\" Almost every startup right now is working on some variation of this problem.\n* Both technical and behavioral questions are assessing your ability to tolerate ambiguity. The biggest mistake for any interview in this space is not spending time to properly understand the problem, which often is purposely made vague. I failed many rounds because of this.",

I've been to the final round of a FAANG adjacent company where they explicitly told me it was this that caused them to take a pass on me. There are also not a lot of seniors on my team to learn from. The tech culture is also very outdated - they are not agile, or a dev shop, which makes my career feel limited here. Additionally, my contract is about to end at the start of Nov, with my Director verbally saying they are doing the best they can to get me a 6-12 month contract extension, which is very hard given the government is in the midst of budget cuts. However, I feel very privileged about everything else. I am fully remote, unionized, full time with benefits, and making around $110k a year. I have amazing WLB with almost 1.5 months of paid leave in one form or another, not to mention a pension.\n\nI have received my first offer, from a very big, multi-billion dollar Canadian insurance company. What does excite me is they have a big and experienced dev team. They are agile, and use Snowflake and Azure. They have a 4.0 star rating on glassdoor. However, in opposition to the pros of the government jobs, they are half in office which is about a 50 minute car/1.5 hour bus commute from me, each way. They have given me an extremely lowball offer of $72.5k incorporated (meaning I have to pay my taxes, unpaid vacation, no insurance), which according to chatgpt, is equal to about $55-60k a year, almost half of what I am currently making. Job security is no better - it is only for 6 months, with only verbally saying they are very likely to make me into a full time after the 6 months.\n\nChatgpt says that this is an absurd offer, and that it is very much a lowball offer, which I agree, and I would need to ask for $120k, MIN $95k as an independent contractor to even consider it. What would you guys think. At my age of 25, is learning skills/best practices worth such a downgrade in pay/WLB? I have no dependencies/mortgage/debt and I think it would be cool to live in the city as well.",

The company specifically says they don't reward long hours.\n\nYet I find this all makes me anxious. I've worked 15 hour days just because I want to feel useful. No one asks me to do this, but everything seems to point to this being a complete fluke and it can all go away in a snap. \n\nIt's fully remote, in a saturated field, great benefits and pay, and many people have called it their dream company. In other words, I feel incredibly replaceable and it makes me work twice as hard.\n\nI feel like I might be on my way to burnout if I don't correct myself. Has anyone been in this position before and how did you deal with it?\n\n",

        "content": "Hello! I'm in a weird predicament and I'd appreciate some advice. Right after graduating, I started working at a job making less than 100k. I have been there for the last 4 years. Towards the last 6 months, I was pretty unmotivated and was completely coasting due to low pay and also not having fun things to work on. One thing to note is that this was a very small startup and I was the first engineer to be hired so I learned a LOT over the years.\n\nFew months ago I decided enough is enough and I started applying and I somehow made it into FAANG.\n\nI'm very happy and proud of myself. I'm now making more money than I ever imagined and I'm more motivated than ever. I want to climb this ladder and shoot for the moon. I know I have the capabilities and I come from a poor family so money is certainly a huge motivation. I'm also a huge nerd and I love to learn. The technologies used in this company are completely different than what I'm used to and I've always been curious on the inner workings of platforms that work at massive scale so having access to all these docs and the entire codebase is incredible.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes I feel like I may be full sending it way too hard. I know the general consensus is that when you start a new job, you shouldn't go too crazy and set unrealistic expectations because you can't keep the same motivation as when you just started over a long period of time.\n\nI just got handed my first project and I was told that while my teammates (who have been here 3-4 years) can probably knock it out in 1-2 weeks, they expect me to take 3-4 weeks (and also said it's totally okay if I take more).\n\nHowever I've been so excited and itching to code and learn that I've completed around 60% of it in 3 days.\n\nSo my question is, should I purposefully slow down?\n\nOn one hand, I want to prove my worth and get promoted to senior as fast as possible because I truly believe I gained the ability to work at that level at the startup, but on the other hand I don't want to set unrealistic expectations.\n\nHow should I go about balancing all this?",

WGU doesn't give GPA, so it's auto 3.0, and my GPA at the state school was bad. \n\nI worked at *three tech internships* across two companies (one I just interviewed for was my first tech position), the first two being service desk (one co-op-like) for 3 years combined, and as a student engineer who coded for 2 years in Python and maintained a full-stack project. My last two Student Eng and SD Student employees were at the same company.\n\n  \n**Graduated June 2025.**\n\n  \nI recently built a Python app that I like, so I added it to my resume:\n\n\\-- Home Builder Market Type Intelligence Tool (Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib) --\n\n◦ Developed a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict California counties with high home-building likelihood, achieving over 80% accuracy.\n\n◦ Cleaned, merged, and analyzed 10+ years of home sales and permit data using Pandas;            visualized insights via interactive Matplotlib heatmaps and county comparisons.\n\n  \n\n\n**Q1**: Should I be doing more? I'm currently unemployed (since May) and got rejected by a company I worked for previously after interviewing for a tech support role. I do not get responses on my job apps for SWE, maybe bc they think I'm a joke applicant LOL, so I Hail Mary a bunch of tech support jobs.\n\n**Q2:** Is there anything that stands out heavily about me that makes me unemployable? I keep thinking about going to GA Tech for their OMSCS just bc I'm failing at this CS stuff rn. \n\n**Q3:** I really like coding in Python and maintaining apps built in Py, but is Python currently too competitive for me to proceed? Should I focus more on my Java side? \n\n**Q4:** Should I work on more projects for my resume, or focus on Leetcode? \n\nThank you all in advance for any advice, I'm gonna go cry about my recent rejection and brb.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nEta: Removed written out job desc ",
