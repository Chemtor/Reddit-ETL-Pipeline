Most confusing shit ever.\n\nI'm more than willing to accept it's an skill issue. But I feel like documentation is pretty much useless. It doesn't help that every single tool decides to make up its own language and concepts to describe things. It doesn't help that the documentation isn't opinionated, straightforward, easy to follow, not all over the place, doesn't show clear examples, how to set it up, what's the proper project structure, what to do if you have a previous project, etc.\n\nAgain, I concede this may be a skill issue. But this is why so many are put off by the overwhelming amount of tools. They should be simple to use IMO but it seems its quite the opposite.\n\nWith that said, if anyone has a good, updated, proper guide, preferrably from someone not trying to sell me something, on how to set up and use either of them, I would appreciate it a lot.",

Does semantic modelling layer sit on top of a dimensional model? \n\nI would really appreciate it if someone could point me to some case studies of different organisations and their data warehouse.",

The full project requirements are kind of insane as it requires multiple different transformation layers for the data. The timeline for this project was around a month which I think is honestly not that much time given the scale of the project and my manager has limited me to work 6hrs/day for 4 days a week(money problems in the startup apparently). There is no other person working on this besides me and we have only had one meeting so far  where the project was described briefly by my manager . \n\nNow I'm feeling kind of burnt out as I have no mentor or other engineer helping me through this(infact no mentor at all during this internship). What are the best ways to approach this? Are there any good resources I can use for MS Fabric? The entire platform just feels like its in beta with so many issues and bugs all around. ",

My middle school had a weeks work of lesson plans teaching us how to coax relevant results out of Altavista and Lycos using quotes, booleans etc.\n\nHowever, I find that the internet is increasingly unusable and I have become a bit too dependent on CGPT. Like, I straight up can no longer find answers to questions. I can't even find webpages or documentation that I know exists, I just can't remember the URL. The old standby of adding \"reddit\" to the question doesn't work either, any post older than a month is all \"obtuse rubber goose up your nose with a rubber hose\" redacted slop.\n\nI can't find answers to questions on stackoverflow and a lot of documentation for python packages is essentially unusable (pyarrow, airflow core not provider packages). I have tried getting a subscription to a premium search engine (Kagi). It's marginally better than google but still extremely frustrating. \n\nSo, like....how do you get unstuck in the year 2025? Someone who is good at the internet please help me, my family is dying.",

        "content": "This is mostly a question for experienced engineers / leads: was there a time when you've regretted going open source instead of building something in-house, or vica versa?\n\nFor context, at work we're mostly reading different databases, and some web apis, and load them to SQL server. So we decided on writing some lightweight wrappers for extract and load, and use those for SQL server. During my last EL task I've decided to use DLT for exploration, and maybe use our in-house solution for production.\n\nHere's the kicker: DLT took around 5 minutes for a 140k row table, which was processed in 10s with our wrappers (still way too long, working on optimizing it). So as much as initially I've hated implementijg our in-house solution, with all the weird edge cases, in the end I couldn't be happier. Not to mention no breaking changes, that could break our pipelines.\n\nLooking at the code for both implementations, it's obvious that DLT simply can't perform the same optimizations as we can, because it has less information about our environments. But these results are quite weird: DLT is the fastest ingestion tool we tested, and it can be easily beat in our specific use case, by an average-at-best set of programmers.\n\nBut I still feel unease, what if a new programmer comes to our team, and they can't be productive for extra 2 months? Was the fact that we can do big table ingestions in 2 minutes vs 1 hour worth the cost of extra 2-3 hours of work when inevitably a new type of source / sink comes in? What are some war stories? Some choices that you regret / greatly appreciate in hindsight? Especially a question for open source proponents: When do you decide that the cost of integrating between different open source solutions is greater than writing your own system, which is integrated by default - as you control everything.",

        "author": "SnooDogs4383",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks, I recently joined a consultancy where we manage data solutions for clients. My team primarily works on Databricks, and I was really impressed at first with Delta Live Tables (now called Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline) and Photon. It felt super intuitive, until I saw the $200 bill just from me testing it out. That was kinda absurd.\n\nAround the same time, I was optimizing a server for another team and stumbled onto DuckDB. I got pulled into a DuckDB rabbit hole. I loved how portable it is, and the idea of single-node compute vs. distributed jobs like Spark made a lot of sense. From what the DuckDB team claims, it can outperform Spark for datasets under \\~5TB, which covers most of what we do.\n\nThat got me thinking: Why not build a data platform where DuckDB is the compute engine, with the option to later switch to Spark (or something else) via an adaptor?\n\nHere’s the rough idea:\n\n1. Everything should work locally—compute and storage.\n2. Add adaptors to connect to any external data source or platform.\n3. Include tools that help design and stress-test data models (seriously, why do most platforms not have this built-in?).  \n\nI also saw that DuckDB Foundation released a new data lake standard that seems like a cleaner way to structure metadata compared to loose files on S3.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n* Databricks just announced **Lakeflow Connect** to integrate with lots of SaaS platforms.  \n* MotherDuck is about to announce **Estuary**, which sounds like it’ll offer similar functionality.  \n* DuckLake (MotherDuck’s implementation of the lake standard) looks promising too.  \n\nSo here’s my actual question:  \n**Is there room or real need for a local-first data lake platform?** One that starts local for speed, cost, and simplicity—but can scale to the cloud later?\n\nI know it sounds like a niche idea. But a lot of small businesses generate a fair amount of data and don’t have the tools or people to set up a proper warehouse. Maybe starting local-first makes it easier for developers to play around without worrying about getting billed every time they test something?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts. Is this just me dev dreaming, or something worth building?",

The Kafka cluster\nis provided by an external company, which also has a UI to see some data and\nsome metrics.\n\nNow, the more topics we have, the more our devs want to debug certain things and analytics people want to explore data. \nSo the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not \npossible. We have now explored other methods to do \"data exploration\":\n\n\n* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType \"decimal\" (wtf?)\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)\n* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways\n* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and \nconfiguration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and \nrequires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)\n* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.\n\nFor you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit \nsurprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature \nand widely adopted. \nAny tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic \nformat? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?\n\nA little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the \ndata as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, \nwhile using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow \nare big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability. I know that the \nArrow Java Implementation, can , supposedly,  deserialize Avro directly into \nArrow. But not the C/Python Implementation.\n\n",

Or simply missing. Or Looker reports \"that used to work\"  are now broken since a new release. Or in cases when the Postgres db has a master/child table, there's often dangling relationships with orphan child records. The most striking thing has been the realization that even the most talented Java coder may not necessarily understand the difference between normalization and denormalization.\n\nIn short, end-users are always impacted.\n\nDo you deal with a similar situation?

        "content": "Hey everyone, I'm working on a POC using Snowflake as our data warehouse and trying to keep the architecture as simple as possible, while still being able to support our business needs. I’d love to get your thoughts, since this is our first time migrating to a modern data stack.\n\nThe idea is to use Snowpipes to load data into Snowflake from ADLS Gen2, where we land all our raw data. From there, we want to leverage dynamic tables to simplify orchestration and transformation. We’re only dealing with batch data for now so no streaming requirements.\n\nFor CI/CD, we’re planning to use either Azure DevOps or GitHub, using the Snowflake repository stage and we currently have three separate Snowflake accounts, so zero-copy cloning won’t be an option.\n\nThe files in ADLS will contain all columns from the source systems, but in Snowflake we’ll only keep the ones we actually need for reporting. Finally, for slowly changing dimensions, we're planning to use integer surrogate keys instead of hash keys.\n\nDo you think this setup is sufficient? I’m also considering using dbt, mainly for data quality testing and documentation. Since lineage is already available in Snowflake and we’re handling CI/CD externally, I'm wondering if there are still strong reasons to bring dbt into the stack. Any downsides or things I should keep in mind?\n\nAlso, I’m a bit concerned about orchestration. Without using a dedicated tool, we’re relying on dynamic tables and possibly Snowflake Tasks, but that doesn’t feel quite scalable long-term especially when it comes to backfills or more complex dependencies.\n\nSorry for the long post but any feedback would be super helpful!",

However, we're running into scalability issues—particularly with writing to Redshift.\nTo support Redshift, we extended the Kafka JDBC Sink Connector by customizing its upsert logic to use MERGE statements. While this works, it's proving to be inefficient at scale. For example, one of our largest tables sees around 5 million change events per day, and this volume is starting to strain the system.\nGiven the upsert-heavy nature of our source systems, we’re re-evaluating our approach. We're considering switching to the Confluent S3 Sink Connector to write Avro files to S3, and then ingesting the data into Redshift via batch processes. This would involve using a mix of COPY operations for inserts and DELETE/INSERT logic for updates, which we believe may scale better.\nHas anyone taken a similar approach?

Company works with high sensitivity data and is very slow to adopt new technology due to hesitance to change. Company has a bespoke software suite and doesn’t hold user data. All data handled is internal and mostly comprised of gathering data from our applications (metrics, logs etc). \n\nI am looking to progress to DE as my skill set (I would say) is more suited to DE and I see this as a suitable next step. \n\nThe issues I face is the modern data stack feels very hard to gain experience in unless you are already in a role that gives exposure to these skills. As I work in a company who is reluctant to adopt new practices, and resistant to suggestions I feel a bit stuck on how to pivot. I am mid thirties with a mortgage and outgoings so an internship is not an option I can take. \n\nMy current role requires me gather data (mostly) from sources that may not already exist, mostly through scripting, storing the data in our on premise  SQL servers and then provide dashboards or applications (usually excel vba). I would say that my experience in these areas is expert level, although they do not lever any of the modern skills I see required in most job specs. I work with extremely messy data and in most cases it is a challenge to create clean analysis from this, which is why I find myself spending more time gathering the data than actually providing the end user with analysis.\n\nCan anybody provide suggestions on some specific things I can focus on portfolio wise that would help me move into DE. The issue I find is that I can state that I have done this or that in my portfolio although I am unable to quantify how I’ve done this or that with this tool at work to achieve this or that result. \n\nI have spent a lot of my own time upskilling (DE zoom camp, some other udemy courses like dbt, aws courses) and doing projects of my own, although I’m struggling to convert this into actual work experience with modern tools. \n\nCan anybody give advice, ideally from a recruiter perspective, how I can efficiently spend my time on tailoring my portfolio and cv to make that move successful. Also - will certs help? And if so, which particularly? I feel like AWS could benefit, although I’m yet to certify. \n",

My ingestion experience consists of exporting CSVs from our source systems to SharePoint, then connecting to Power BI and transforming there. I got buy-in from management for a centralized data solution in AWS. We reached out to a couple of engineering teams and received two proposals. The first one proceeds with our original intent of building a warehouse in Redshift, while the second one aims for lakehouse architecture using S3/Athena/Iceberg/Glue. I had not even heard of a lakehouse before starting this project.  \n\nWe record our work across multiple cloud software and need to merge them into a single source of truth. We also need to store historical snapshots of our data, which we are not able to do currently. While structured, this internal data is not large. We do not generate even 1GB of data annually. I understand that such a data size is laughable for considering a managed warehouse. However, we plan on ingesting JSON files spanning hundreds of gigs every month. While I am sure that we will not need most of the data in those files, I still want to keep them in their original format just in case. Since I have been unable to peek inside these files, I will be exploring this data for the first time. I feel that the production data will only be a few gigs. We are also reconfiguring our Jira projects, so I worry that field deletions and schema changes would convolute a warehouse implementation.  \n\nWhile I would like to build this myself, I have no coding experience and we work with healthcare data so we would need security expertise as well. Thousands of dollars per month is out of the question at the moment, so I am looking for a cost-effective and scalable solution. I just wonder if Redshift or S3 + Athena is that solution. Oh, and we would hire an engineer to manage this solution.  \n\nThanks in advance for your time!",

From my understanding, parquets are formatted in a way to not load excess data when querying items inside nested structs as of 2.4sh.\n\nOtherwise, the alternative is splitting apart the data into 30-60 tables for each data type we have in our Iceberg tables to flatten out repeated fields. Without testing yet, I would presume queries are faster with nested structs than doing several one-many joins for usable data.\n\nThanks!",

We do have Airflow on the Composer, in which we have the 'smtp\\_default' connection setup which is authenticated through simple login/password, so that we can send email from our Microsoft Outlook app email account during some failures/retries or other use cases.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is retiring basic auth and will \"force\" to use oauth: [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-online-to-retire-basic-auth-for-client-submission-smtp-auth/4114750](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-online-to-retire-basic-auth-for-client-submission-smtp-auth/4114750)\n\nThe problem is, if I got it correctly, Airflow SMTP does not support oauth:  \n[https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/51094](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/51094)  \n[https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/32834](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/32834)\n\nNow, I am wondering, how should I tackle this to still be able to use the SMTP option.

I would really like to make sure that the transition/changes we will be implementing are not in fact introducing some anti-patterns...   \nIs there any better/more clean way of tackling it?  \n  \nThanks!

        "author": "AdLivid1589",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I'm building a chatbot that can answer questions from scanned infrastructure project documents (think government-issued construction certificates, with financial tables, scope of work, and quantities executed). I have around 100 PDFs, each corresponding to a different project.\n\nI want to build a chatbot which lets users ask questions like:\n\n* “Where have we built toll plazas?”\n* “Have we built a service road spanning X m?”\n* “How much earthwork was done in 2023?”\n\nThese documents are scanned PDFs with non-standard table formats, which makes this harder than a typical document QA setup.\n\n# Current Pipeline (working for one doc):\n\n1. **OCR**: I’m using Amazon Textract to extract raw text (structured as best as possible from scanned PDFs). I’ve tried Google Vision also but Textract gave the most accurate results for multi-column layouts and tables.\n2. **Parsing**: Since table formats vary a lot across documents (headers might differ, row counts vary, etc.), regex didn’t scale well. Instead, I’m using ChatGPT (GPT-4) with a prompt to parse the raw OCR text into a structured JSON format (split into sections like salient\\_feature, scope of work, financial burification table, quantities executed table, etc.)\n3. **QA**: Once I have the structured JSON, I pass it back into ChatGPT and ask questions like:The chatbot processes the JSON and returns accurate answers.“Where did I construct a toll plaza?” “What quantities were executed for Bituminous Concrete in 2023?”\n\n# Challenges I'm facing:\n\n1. **Scaling to multiple documents**: What’s the best architecture to support 100+ documents?\n   * Should I store all PDFs in S3 (or similar) and use a trigger (like S3 event or Lambda) to run Textract + JSON pipeline as soon as a new PDF is uploaded?\n   * Should I store all final JSONs in a directory and load them as knowledge for the chatbot (e.g., via LangChain + vector DB)?\n   * What’s a clean, production-grade pipeline for this?\n2. **Inconsistent table structures** Even though all documents describe similar information (project cost, execution status, quantities), the tables vary significantly in headers, table length, column allignment, multi-line rows, blank rows etc. Textract does an okay job, but still makes mistakes — and ChatGPT sometimes hallucinates or misses values when prompted to structure it into JSON. Is there a better way to handle this step?\n3. **JSON parsing via LLM: how to improve reliability?** Right now I give ChatGPT a single prompt like: “Convert this raw OCR text into a JSON object with specific fields: \\[project\\_name, financial\\_bifurcation\\_table, etc.\\]”. But this isn't 100% reliable when formats vary across documents. Sometimes certain sections get skipped or misclassified.\n   * Should I chain multiple calls (e.g., one per section)?\n   * Should I fine-tune a model or use function calling instead?\n\n# Looking for advice on:\n\n* Has anyone built something similar for scanned docs with LLMs?\n* Any recommended open-source tools or pipelines for structured table extraction from OCR text?\n* How would you architect a robust pipeline that can take in a new scanned document → extract structured JSON → allow semantic querying over all projects?\n\nThanks in advance — this is my first real-world AI project and I would really really appreciate any advice yall have as I am quite stuck lol :)\n\n",

        "content": "A recap of a precision manufacturing client who was running on systems that were literally held together with duct tape and prayer. Their inventory data was spread across 3 different databases, production schedules were in Excel sheets that people were emailing around, and quality control metrics were...well, let's just say they existed somewhere.\n\nThe real kicker? Leadership kept asking for \"real-time visibility\" into operations while we are sitting on data that's 2-3 days old by the time anyone sees it. Classic, right?\n\n**The main headaches we ran into:**\n\n* ERP system from early 2000s that basically spoke a different language than everything else\n* No standardized data formats between production, inventory, and quality systems\n* Manual processes everywhere where people were literally copy-pasting between systems\n* Zero version control on critical reports (nightmare fuel)\n* Compliance requirements that made everything 10x more complex\n\n**What broke during migration:**\n\n* Initial pipeline kept timing out on large historical data loads\n* Real-time dashboards were too slow because we tried to query everything live\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* Staged approach with data lake storage first\n* Batch processing for historical data, streaming for new stuff\n\nWe ended up going with Azure for the modernization but honestly the technical stack was the easy part. The real challenge was getting buy-in from operators who have been doing things the same way for 15+ years.\n\n**What I am curious about:** For those who have done similar manufacturing data consolidations, how did you handle the change management aspect? Did you do a big bang migration or phase it out gradually?\n\nAlso, anyone have experience with real-time analytics in manufacturing environments? We are looking at implementing live dashboards but worried about the performance impact on production systems.\n\nWe actually documented the whole journey in a whitepaper if anyone's interested. It covers the technical architecture, implementation challenges, and results. Happy to share if it helps others avoid some of the pitfalls we hit.",

        "content": "Hi. This is purely a pedantic question, with no practical impact on what is being developed. But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.\n\nWe have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. \n\nNow, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually \"loading\" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. \n\nSo, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline). Is it neither of them, or some other Jargon I don't know about? ",

        "author": "sumant28",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This seems like it should be a really basic pattern but I have been struggling to figure out what is ideal rather than just what will work. To my surprise I do not really see an existing solution that entirely answers this post but from ChatGPT I have a strong hunch what I need to do but I have further issues to clarify.\n\n\nIf there is a daily ingest of about 1MB of data in JSON is it best to partition that data in the raw or bronze folder from the date as a string or instead to partition by year, month and day. All this time I was doing the latter approach thinking that was optimal but I have since found out that only is best for huge data systems which often further partition into hours and minutes and deal with petabytes or terabytes of data.\n\n\nThe issue I have learned is that partition trees grow too large with calendar partitions rather than the simple flat structure of date strings. However my issue is that in terms of queries I have nothing ad hoc. The only thing the data is used for is to create dashboards filtering at different levels of time granularity. For example some dashboards would be by week, some by fortnight, some by month, some by year.\n\n\nFor these queries that power these dashboards I do not know if the earlier partition even allows any benefits of partitions at all. I read that the partition still helps but I was not able to understand why. My most important dashboard is by week and I do not see how a partition by date string allows the query engine to speed up filtering by the current week or the previous week.\n\n\nI have some other questions specific to AWS. For the etl job that transforms the bronze layer to parquet I learned that bookmarks also need to be used. I read that it is best practice to have as a source the crawled data catalog table rather than the JSON files. Is this still true? That means for job bookmarking in order to process only incremental data you have to rely on a key which is a column of data or field rather than the easier to understand bookmarking by file. If you are bookmarking by key that points to using date string rather than using a trio of date partitions like year, month and day which are all also nested. For reducing complexity is that the right assumption?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey, I would just like to open by saying this post is extremely biased and selfish in nature. Now with that in mind, I work at a bank as a Student Data Engineer while doing an Msc in Data Engineering.\n\nMy team consists of my supervisor and myself. He is a Data Analyst that doesn't have much technical expertise (just some Python and SQL knowledge but for doing basic things).\n\nWe handle data at a monthly granularity level. When I was brought in 11 months ago, the needs weren't well defined (in fact they weren't defined at all). Since then, we've been slowly gaining more clarity. Our work now mainly consists of exporting data from SAP Business Objects, doing Extract-Transform in Python and exporting aggregates (typed cleansed joined data). This is in fact what I did. He then uses the aggregates to do some dashboarding in Excel. Now he started using Power BI for dashboarding.\n\nI suggested moving to an Airbyte->DW->DBT ELT pipeline. I'm implementing a POC for this purpose. But my supervisor asked if it would be better to use Alteryx as an ETL tool instead. His motives are that he wants us to remain a business oriented team not a technical one that implements and maintains technical solutions, another motive of his is that the data isn't voluminous enough to warrant the approach I suggested (Most of our source excel files are less than 100k rows with one being less than 150k rows and another being at more than 1.5M rows)\n\nMy motives on the other hand are why I said this post is selfish. I plan to use this as a Final Year Project. And, I feel like this would advance my career (improve my CV) better than Alteryx which I feel is more targeted towards Data Analysts who like Drag-and-Drop UIs and no code quality of life approaches.\n\nOne point I know my approach beats out Alteryx in is auditability. It is important to document the transformations our data goes through and I feel that that is more easily done and ensured with my approach.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Am I too selfish in what I'm doing or is it ok (considering I'm going to soon be freshly graduated and really want to be able to show this 14 month long experience as genuine, real work that will be relevant to the type of positions I would be targeting) ?\n2. How do I convince my supervisor of my approach ?",

        "content": "\n\nSo this has been on my mind lately, not just how people learn stuff like coding or math, but how they figured out how to learn in the first place. Like, what made the switch from “I’m just reading stuff” to “I actually understand what I’m doing”?\n\nMost advice out there is the same laundry list: spaced repetition, Pomodoro, flashcards, blah blah. But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?\n\nI think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.\n\nPersonally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was. Like, when did learning stop being random chaos and start becoming a process you understood?\n",

        "author": "peterlinddk",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I don't know if this will reach those who need it the most, but I've seen a lot of posts from people being confused as to which programming language to choose, asking how long it will take to learn something, asking when you'll have learned enough to learn more or get a job. But unfortunately those questions can't really be answered - but fortunately it doesn't really matter!\n\nRemember that a programming language is *a language* \\- and just like other languages created by humans, they are used to convey ideas to other humans. The computer doesn't care about the language you program it in, it only understands machine code, so the moment your program compiles you are basically free to throw away the source code. Except you don't do that, because you might want to change things later, or have someone else look at the code, another human, or a large language model, that also (tries to) understand language.\n\nSo learning a programming language is a lot like learning any other language - there are syntax rules, grammar, different classes of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and there are all the words in the language. A lot of them added by other humans, and in most cases still being added.\n\nIf you managed to learn English (or whatever other secondary language you learnt) by reading the definition of the grammar and syntax, committing all the special cases to memory, and memorizing every single word, well, then maybe that will also work for you when learning programming! - But most of us didn't learn it that way, we picked up a few words, understood the sentence-structure, partly, tried to use the language, spoke and wrote, and made a lot of mistakes. And gradually we got better and better, learned more \"rules\" and even more exceptions to those rules, and picked up a lot of new words as we went along.\n\nNobody has ever \"completed\" learning English - for one the language always changes, and always has, and also there are simply to many words, to many dialects even, to ever learn everything.\n\nSame goes for programming - you will probably never complete any language, there will always be something new to learn, or something that *you* use so rarely that you forget about it, and have to look it up on the rare occasions that you *do* need it.\n\nBut that shouldn't discourage you from learning other languages - if you have to travel to France or Spain, you'll probably need to learn some French or Spanish, and you might even like it so much that you decide to stay and learn more - while still keeping your English, maybe forgetting a bit more than before, but never mind, you still know how to look it up!\n\n\n\nThere are some grammar rules that you'll never understand, but somehow manage to use anyways. A lot of languages have gendered words, with very unspecific rules about why a specific word is one gender, but you'll get used to it \"sounding wrong\" when you use the wrong one. Same in programming, you might not be able to fully comprehend async or lambdas or closure, but just use it to write code where it \"sounds right\". A number of books and blogposts will try to invent rules to remember, but often they are even more difficult to understand, and also quite often simply wrong. So you'll get by and just \"do programming\" always feeling that you don't fully understand everything.\n\nLike you don't fully understand everything in the languages you write or speak - like you haven't meticulously memorized every single word, but somehow still use them. \n\n  \nAnd some people find it easy to adapt to new languages, while others keep talking the dialect of their hometown even after having lived everywhere else their entire life. Sometimes you hear or read a word, and immediately understand it, other times you'll struggle your entire career with the spelling or pronouncination of some. The experience is different for everyone, and there is no set speed for how anything takes anyone else to learn.\n\nI hope that those of you fixating on languages will read and understand this - and maybe stop worrying so much, and get going using the languages - the programming languages - to actually build something. Not important original masterpieces, just small stories where you use the language as you are learning.",

I am a bio major. I really have no background on this. At all.\n\nI am already browsing on available courses and tutorials but the catch is I need to learn the basics in less than a month (classes are ongoing, we are on multimedia topic now then programming by next month). Honestly, I can’t afford to lose a minute browsing something difficult because I was wrong in selecting that when possibly there is a better way…basically, I do not know what to choose. \n\nI’m sorry for bothering you all, but I am kind of desperate. I am reading the FAQs and watched the video recommendation. Now I am confused. I just a guiding hand. 😭\n\nI am really willing to learn. I work whole day so I am available at nights after work.

Not simple cookie-cutter or tutorial projects. Proper projects. \n\nThe issue is... aside from *game making* i really don't have any passion behind other projects that aren't... well.. too difficult. \n\nThings like machine learning, embedded software. Etc. \n\nI know eventually I'll begin to learn these down the line with Ossu (all apart of the curriculum) but this is 6-14months away minimum. \n\nDo others ever experience this?

Looking for advice on the best next step in my programming journey.\n\n**Background:** 37 y/o attorney with a Bachelors from Duke but in a non-STEM field. Spent the last 3 years doing MIT's undergrad Computer Science curriculum as well as the Odin Project. I would say I have an intermediate-level understanding of a lot of the concepts you would typically learn in an undergrad CS curriculum like OOP, DSA (basic concepts like DFS, BFS, linked lists, etc. as well as some slightly more advanced concepts like skip lists, VEB trees, linear programming, etc.), basic hardness proofs, discrete math, basic computer architecture, etc. Unfortunately because I went the entirely self-taught route, aside from portfolio projects I don't have any sort of credential to demonstrate this knowledge (for this reason, I'd recommend people avoid going that route if they can help it).\n\n**Goals:** At a minimum, I'd like to be able to sit for the patent bar and potentially leverage that to work more with clients in the tech industry. The dream scenario would be to make a career switch to software engineering but given my age and the state of the market I know that is extremely unlikely, so more focused on how I could leverage this for my law practice.\n\n**Path I'm Considering:** Am I crazy for thinking that Western Governors University is a logical next step for me? It's inexpensive, it seems like I might be able to grind through the curriculum pretty quick, and then I would at least have the Bachelors in CS box checked. The downside is that some of the stuff I read elsewhere on Reddit makes it sound like a diploma mill. But other online bachelors are much more expensive and might take me over 2 years to finish, and at the end of the day they are still online degrees so not sure they would even carry that much more weight anyway. \n\nI'm also really intrigued by Georgia Tech's OMSCS, but surprisingly it sounds like it would *not* be enough for me to sit for the patent bar because it's a Masters not a Bachelors. However, if I could knock out WGU in the next 6-9 months I could apply to GT in the Spring if I decide I want to go that route, so that's maybe another benefit of taking the WGU path.\n\nFor those who have gone to WGU or who are knowledgeable about the various options for an online bachelors in CS, is WGU really so much worse than other online programs that it is worth the extra time and money to do another program? Or am I right for thinking that it makes sense for someone in my position?\n\n",

Now, I’m broke, unemployed, and desperately trying to learn programming again — not just as a hobby, but as a way to build something that can actually generate income for me and my family.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already tried:\n\n1. FreeCodeCamp YouTube tutorials — I never seem to finish them.\n\n\n2. Harvard CS50’s Python course.\n\n\n3. FreeCodeCamp’s full stack web dev course.\n\n\n4. Books on Python and one on C++.\n\n\n\nBut despite all of this, I still feel like I haven’t made real progress. I constantly feel stuck — like there’s so much to learn just to start building anything useful. I don’t have any mentors, friends, or community around me to guide me. Most days, it feels like I’m drowning in information.\n\nI’m not trying to complain — I just don’t know what to do anymore. If you’ve been where I am or have any advice, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nI want to turn my life around and make something of myself through programming.

How likely is it that they will give me some leetcode problem (its not a multi million company its a smaller company)... how do I prepare for it now? Will they even ask me some technical questions again if they already asked me some? Or do they just wanna get to know me personal.\n\nWhat should I learn in .NET to be fully prepared for the job in general. I still believe Im not ready for a programming job. I have absolutely no self confidence and I am very scared ill get a hard logic problem to solve and that I will completely get stuck at solving it... \n\nAny advice? Thank you! ",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello all, I hope this is ok to post here. I am a complete beginner to programming and my second language is Cree. I am posting here to ask how I should tackle this large project I have envisioned. My goal is to create a desktop-based application that is a dictionary for my Indigenous language. However I would like this to be more than just a dictionary, for example I would like to include all the conjugation tables for all verbs, which we have quite a lot in Cree. (In fact, around 85% of “words” in Cree are verbs). This would literally require tens of thousands of entries.\n\nNow every word can have quite a number of connections to other concepts. For example I envision this dictionary to include a section for synonyms and antonyms for each entry,  each entry having a section for “semantic field” for related entries, a section for each entry showing all other entries from the root of that word. As well as relationships between words that mean the same, for example the same verb, just simply having a different gender for the object.\n\nI will just give some examples below:\n\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓐ (aahkwaatin) means “it is fierce, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓰᐤ (aahkwaatisiiu) means “s/he is fierce, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᔅᑲᑎᓐ (aahkwaaskatin) means “it is frozen very solid”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᔕᒻ (aahkwaatisham) means “s/he cuts it badly, seriously”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑲᒥᑌᐤ (aahkwaakamiteu) means “it is painfully hot liquid”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑌᔨᒣᐤ (aahkwaateyimeu) means “s/he thinks s/he is harmful, dangerous”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᓯᓈᑯᓐ (aahkwaasinaakun) means “it looks dangerous, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑖᐦᑲᓴᒻ (aahkwaataahkasam) means “s/he burns it badly”\n\nYou can see the pattern. Certain parts of the word mean certain things and this can be applied to all other words, this complex connectedness is what I would like to show and be able to interact with in my dictionary. To be able to categorize, display and filter through such related roots and terms.\n\nMy question is which programming language should I learn to attempt such a project? As well as any tips or references that you all may have on how I should approach such a complex project.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read through this and helping me keep my language alive and flourishing.\n\nAlso, if this language interests you, feel free to PM me to learn more about it! I am clearly passionate about my language and willing to share my knowledge with others.",

        "content": "If you're a complete beginner who's just started programming or are about to begin your journey, please go through this first (This really helped me put things into perspective):\n\nWhat is programming?\n\n- I know you kinda know what it is but I bet most don't. We all know the bookish definition. But have you actually ever thought about it a bit deeper?\n\nA computer is a really dumb machine when it comes to doing things human can do and understand. If you say to a human - Go fetch me that pen 🖊️ that's over there on the table! \n\nThey will gladly go and bring it to you. \n\nBut to a computer (machine) you'd need to break that instruction into steps. Steps that may look like the following:\n\nStep 1: Hey computer! Get up, if you're sitting.\nStep 2: Now locate the table.\nStep 3: Identify something that looks like a pen 🖊️ \nStep 4: Head over to the table\nStep 5: Pick up the pen\nStep 6: Locate the person\nStep 7: Head over to the person with the pen\nStep 8: Give the pen to the person\nStep 9: Wait for further instructions.\nStep 10: If no instructions given go back to where you were earlier. \n\nI may have missed a few steps here but you get the idea. Right?\n\nTo a computer you would need to tell it the exact steps it would have to perform to complete the task.\n\nAnd that right there is programming. \n\nThe instruction I have written use English language which a computer doesn't understand so humans built programming languages like C, Python etc.\n\nSo every time you sit down to write a program just remember that you're telling a computer what it needs to do to complete a task. That's it. \n\nHence, learning programming is more about developing your ability to break a problem into steps & convert those steps into code. \n\nNote: I know this is super basic stuff but strangely none of my teachers back in college explained it to me this way. And knowing this now makes things a bit easier. \n",

Eventually, I realized freelancing wasn't the right long-term path for me, so I decided to pursue full-time employment.\n\nWhile doing some research, I came across tons of discouraging posts claiming that landing an entry-level dev job is almost impossible these days. Most of these were about the US market - not the EU - so I was wondering:\n\nIs there a big difference between the two in terms of how hard it is to land a job and what kind of skills are expected?\n\nI get that a lot of these comments probably come from people who gave up before actually breaking into the industry - but they still made me very anxious.\n\nI’m not chasing amazing benefits or a six-figure salary - I just want a stable job doing what I enjoy, with room to grow and improve.\n\nNot gonna lie, doomscrolling through programming subs has left me feeling genuinely depressed this past week, I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nAt one point, I even started questioning whether I should switch fields entirely, just because it felt like I might end up stuck in the job-hunting loop forever.\n\nIs it really that bad these days, even if you've got the time and space to grind and stay consistent? \n",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "As the title states, I would call myself a C++ programmer because it’s the main language I use.  Of course, there are others I use, like C, Java, TS, python, etc.  but I have stuck to C++ for so long because after graduating (I’m in my final year of CS bachelors), I want to work in systems programming/high performance systems programming (particularly computer graphics).  As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc.  \n\nBut, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases.  Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong.  Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it.  No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.\n\nOf course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on.  My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff.  I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff.  But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with it\n\nSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++? Or is there a good alternative to C++?",

I’ve been programming for about two years and just started my first job as a backend developer a couple of weeks ago. They put me on a project where I have to **build everything from scratch**, completely on my own, and here’s the kicker:\n\n* The requirements were explained in a super vague way;\n* There’s no clear architecture or technical guidelines;\n* There’s no testing setup or staging environment;\n* **Deadline: three weeks.**\n\nIn the last couple of days, the anxiety has completely taken over. I feel like I’m writing terrible, unstructured code because I have no idea if I’m even heading in the right direction. I can’t properly test anything, which makes me feel even worse. I’ve been so stressed that I’ve cried and even started doubting if I made the right career choice.\n\n**My main questions:**\n\n1. How do you approach projects with unclear requirements when you’re working solo?\n2. How do you make something at least *somewhat* testable when you don’t have any infrastructure or environment to rely on?\n3. If you’ve experienced this kind of anxiety or burnout early in your career, how did you handle it and regain some confidence?\n\nAny advice, personal stories, or even just “this is normal, breathe” would mean a lot.

After graduating, I finally had time and built around 8 projects. For the first few, I had clear ideas but rushed the process, using ChatGPT a lot for code (though I understood the logic). Later, I changed my approach: I'd plan the project, share my thought process with ChatGPT, ask for feedback on my logic, request pseudocode if needed, and then code it step-by-step. If stuck, I'd ask for guidance — not code — especially with library functions. I even added “No code dump, just guide me” to my prompts. It helped me learn a lot, but I’m wondering: **am I on the right path?** Is there a better way to balance learning and coding with AI support? Should I continue this approach?",

I've been looking into programming for a little while, I (think) I've learned most of the basics of python but I'm still very much a beginner at this point and I'm looking into some more specific things I can do with it just to grow my skill and learn more about the language. Also I'm also a big ice hockey fan so I like to implement that where I can. So this is a simple webscrapping program I made, asks the user to input a players name, uses that name to find a url from [hockey-database.com](http://hockey-database.com) for that player, scrapes the stat totals, and prints them out to the user. It's functional, but I keep having this feeling that I've been doing something completely stupid and wrong and that there is a much better way to do this. any advice on how I could make this better would be appreciated, I made this entirely by looking up guides and reading some documentation, so if I did in fact do anything stupid that's my excuse :)",

Maybe it also plays a part that im not a native english speaker, but I can understand it pretty well, so it shouldn’t be the problem. Here are some examples I just found:\n\nGo unsafe package Alignof function:\n\n“Alignof takes an expression x of any type and returns the required alignment of a hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x. It is the largest value m such that the address of v is always zero mod m. It is the same as the value returned by…” okay? No idea how could I use this? Why would I need an alignment of a hypothetical variable?\n\nKea DHCP:\n\n“Designed to Integrate with Your Existing Systems. Kea allows you to separate the data from the execution environment, enabling new deployment options.” This is so broad, what data can I separate? What is the execution environment? What this has to do with dhcp?\n\nI could search for more, but I hope this two kinda illustrates my point. \n\nAnd JUST TO BE CLEAR, I’m not blaming the people who write the documentations, in fact I envy them, and I want to learn how to understand them better (if it’s possible, maybe I’m just dumb), because now basically the only way I can learn something is through video tutorials, as they explain it in a very friendly way usually, or if the documentation is very well and easily understandably written.\n\n",

Are there any free resources / websites that people would suggest for learning java? \n\nI have done some programming in python before and a bit in C so I already know the basics like data types, loops, conditionals, variables, and all that stuff.\n\nPreferably I would be looking for a website with some stuff that I can just read and a few examples here and there that I can look at but a video series would be ok as well. (although text is preferred)\n\nI don't mind if it starts from the basics, that would be fine as a little refresher and to see what java does differently than other languages, I can always skip what I already know.\n\nAlso its a small annoyance, not really a problem, but I don't like sites that offer free resources or tutorials and stuff but then force you to create an account. Although if its worth it for what they offer and they have good resources that's fine, but I just don't like having to create 5 different accounts for a bunch of different services.  \n\n\nI know its unlikely anyone will know it but a while ago (might have been on a different subreddit) there was someone who posted a website they were making to teach others java and it was pretty nice, plain text, some examples with syntax highlighting, but no adds or images that I had noticed, just text.\n\nIf anyone happens to know remember the site it would be neat if you could comment the link thanks.\n\n\nEdit: \njust as context for the type of site I would (ideally) like to look for.

I watched an AI agent, part of an internally built tool our company is piloting, take in a small Jira ticket. It was the kind of task that would usually take me or a teammate about an hour. Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.\n\nThe AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.\n\nThis wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.\n\nWhat really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.\n\nI’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.\n\nI’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? What are you doing to adapt? How are you thinking about the future of our field?",

Always put up with long nights, long code reviews, etc. The whole nine yards. But, in the real world, working hard doesn't mean jack shit if it doesn't produce good results. Or, at least, the results your boss wants in the timely manner that they please. So I was always on the disappointing end of my boss. There was never a time when I was good enough for him. I always felt... mediocre. And this isn't to pin anything on my boss or whatever. I'm just saying that I wasn't able to live up to his expectations.\n\nI lost a lot of sleep over the fact that I was just never good enough; I was never off of work mode, due to the anxiety and the constant self-deprecation. There were even nights when I'd run to the toilet for a quick vomit session due to the stress.\n\nThere was always something to complain about. Something to say about my not being good at this or that. \"Why did you do it like this?\" and \"You definitely had AI write up this code, didn't you?\" (no, I didn't). Despite it all, I still tried. I tried my darnedest. I grit my teeth and took everything as feedback and always thanked him. I always tried applying what I was told. I always admitted when I fell short, never pushing back or disrespecting my boss due to my feelings or ego being hurt. I always took everything on the chin. But it always ate at me. So, of course, I snapped. I told my boss that I was quitting cold turkey. Why? It was the only way out of the intense burnout that I could see.\n\nTo my surprise, he didn't want me to quit. But of course. It costs money to find, hire, and train a new engineer, and it's risky when you don't really know what that new engineer could be capable of (or not), as opposed to the engineer that you already have and are familiar with. So I'm not surprised. But I've known my boss for a while now. Me revoking my quitting was not going to solve anything for *me*. Maybe it would've in the short-term at my job, but I know that things would've just gone back to how they always were. That's how life rolls. So I doubled down and told him that I was not open to changing my mind.\n\nI'm going to be moving back in with my parents as soon as possible. Don't know when that is yet. I'm still... going through the motions. But, for now, I'm jobless. I'm in a weird place right now, emotionally, where I feel very relaxed and liberated in that I no longer have to put up with the stress that I did at work. But, at the same time, I'm afraid of whether or not I'll get work at all anytime soon. I'm afraid of whether or not this was a good call.\n\nBut, the way things were, I knew the one answer that I needed at the time: A break from work. A long break. A few months would be nice.\n\nRegardless, this is where I'm at right now.\n\nHow's *your* work life? lol\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Hey! This post was originally meant for me to just relieve myself of some negative energy. I honestly didn't think it was going to get anywhere, but here we are, over 300 upvotes later lol. I've read through most of the responses, and I just want to thank you all. Like, really. In times like this, realistic advice is always the best advice, and a lot of you took the time to write up thoughtful and helpful responses. I really appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nAnd for those who thought this post was AI-generated... No, it was not lol",

        "author": "Broad-Cranberry-9050",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\nIm 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2020-2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent a few years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after a few months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses.  I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.\n\nHere are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:\n\n# Onboarding:\n\nDefense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.\n\nFAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.\n\nCurrent: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.\n\n# work life balance:\n\nDefense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a \"extra time\" bank and use it as future PTO.\n\nFAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.\n\nCurrent - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a \"work late\" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.\n\n# Expectiations:\n\nDefense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.\n\nFAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.\n\nCurrent - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was \"if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance\".\n\n# Time and meetings:\n\nDefense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.\n\nFAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.\n\nCurrent - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.\n\nEdit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was.\n\n# Interview:\n\nDefense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like \"what is OOP?\" or how I would design a simple code.\n\nFAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet.\n\nBig tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions.\n\nEdit 2: people asked about TC\n\n# TC\n\n\\- Defense: as a college grad in a HCOL state I started at about 78k wiht a 5k bonus. Within 4 years and 1 promotion I was making 90k and yearly bonuses that was around 5k-8k.  No stock. I know people who jumped to other defense company and they are around 120k. Promotion seemed like it happened every 2-3 years.\n\n\\- FAANG - I never got promoted in my few years though I doubt I deserved it in their eyes. I never really saw anybody get promoted really. Like one mid level SWE had been working more than most seniors and she didnt get promoted. AS for TC it was about 220k between base stocks and signing bonus. I moved to a low COL state shortly after joining and my base pay dropped by 20k so it ended up being around 200k\n\n\\- Current company - TC is about 200k with just basepay and stock (no signing bonus) but according to them, im promised up to 10% bonus that would bring my total pay to around 215k.\n\n# Benefits\n\n\\- Defense: 3 weeks of accrued PTO. But since there was timsheet we technically were not allowed to do overtime. A work around was if I worked 90 hours in a 2 week period, I could use 10 hours and save it in a special bank that I could use later on. So If in a 4 week period I worked 200 hours, I could set 40 hours to that special bank. And if I had a 2week vacation I could use the special bank for the first week and my regular PTO for the second week. It was good benefits outside of that, tuition reimbursement which I used to get my master's degree without taking on more debt. Discounts on personal travel (it wasnt amazing but good enough) etc.\n\n\\- FAANG - Unlimited PTO. Some of the best benefits i've ever seen will probably will ever have. There were multiple different types of reimbursement programs for almost anything. Discount codes on almost any store that were actually pretty good discounts. Similar benefits when it comes to tuition reimbursement, etc.\n\n\\- Big tech - unlimited PTO. Again good benefits, just not as good as FAANG. Company will give random 3 day weekends to employees that they announce pretty early so people have it prepared.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you think AI will be replacing you as an engineer, you are probably wildly overestimating the AI, or underestimating yourself. Let me explain.\n\nThe best AI cannot even do 10% of my job as a senior software engineer I estimate. And there are hard problems which prevent them from doing any better, not in the least of which is that they already ran out of training data. They are also burning through billions with no profitability in sight, almost as quickly as they are burning through natural resources such as water, electricity and chips. Not even to mention the hardest problem which is that it is a machine (or rather, routine), not a sentient being with creativity. It will always think \"inside the box\" even if that box appears to be very large. While they are at it, they hallucinate quite a good percentage of their answers as well, making them critically flawed for even the more mundane tasks without tight supervision. None of these problems have a solution in the LLM paradigm. \n\nLLMs for coding is a square peg for a round hole. People tend to think that due to AI being a program that it naturally must be good at programming, but it really doesn't work that way. It is the engineers that make the program, not the other way around. They are far better at stuff like writing and marketing, but even there it is still a tool at best and not replacing any human directly. Yes, it can replace humans indirectly through efficiency gains but only up till a point. In the long term, the added productivity gained from using the tool should merit hiring more people, so this would lead to more jobs, not less.\n\nThe reason we are seeing so many layoffs right now is simply due to the post-pandemic slump. Companies hired like crazy, had all kinds of fiscal incentives and the demand was at an all time high. Now all these factors have been reversed and the market is correcting. Also, the psychopathic tendency to value investors over people has increased warranting even more cost cutting measures disguised as AI efficiency gains. That's why it is so loved by investors, it's a carte blanche to fire people and \"trim the fat\" as they put it. For the same reason, Microsoft's CEO is spouting nonsense that XX% of the code is already written by AI. It's not true, but it raises the stock price like clockwork, and that’s the primary mission of a CEO of a large public company.\n\ntl;dr AI is mostly a grift artificially kept afloat by investor billions which are quickly running out",

I was never able to get any internship, never developed a robust networked, and never saw any benefit from majoring in CS besides stress and a piece of paper.\n\nMy strengths are I had a lot of success in university research. I was able to get a pretty prestigious publication and had a great time actually contributing to undergrad research. However, I *really* don’t want to work in SWE. I’m very money-driven and don’t see eye-to-eye with the general academic mission (I also despised teaching and kind of hated school, I also found no lecturers I really connected with). \n\nAt this point, I’m about 90% sure I want to abandon any SWE dreams I once had an unshelf my high school aspirations to become an attorney. I have taken the LSAT and got a recent enough score to go to a T30 law school. What do you guys think? Is it time to “abandon all hope, ye who enter here?”\n\n**Edit: I guess should be more clear with my questions: is all hope lost for me? Are my feelings that I need to go to law school to have a successful career, and sticking with SWE would lead to no success, valid?**\n\n**TL;DR: No success with internships. Some success in research and school. Should I give up with SWE?**",

        "content": "I'm 48 years old in the USA and wondering if it's too late for a career change. I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. \n\nThe good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.\n\nThe bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email.   \n\nI am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how \"real\" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nI plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long. So I guess I'm in that phase where I feel too old and outdated to do anything else but still too young to retire... but doing nothing is becoming scarier by the day.",

I graduated last year from a top CS uni in Canada with internships.\n\nThankfully I'm currently employed as a Python developer (backend) at a small company in Canada. By small, think very small. Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve. I'm stagnating, and have been for a while.\n\nThe problem is that I need to make more money. And I don't know where to start. I'm looking for other roles but I'm getting no bites. I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews. But I did flop the ones I got, other than my current job, of course. \n\nNow, the question is this: if I want FAANG to look at my resume a year from now, what do I have to do? Hell, it doesn't even have to be FAANG. Any tech company would be enough. Or even any reputable company even. How can I save myself from being out of a job in a year and having to spend 6 months looking for another one?",

I didn't have any prior data science experience, but the codebase was manageable, and most of my tasks involved fixing bugs or building straightforward features without  deep DS knowledge.\n\nRecently, my manager asked me if I wanted to change my job title to reflect my current role, I agreed. But to officially \"transfer\", I had to pass a Python coding test. I was surprised since by this point I'd already shipped multiple features, fixed a shit ton of bugs, but went ahead anyway.\n\nThe first test went super badly lol, questions about two-sum, basic string manipulation, pandas, and numpy threw me off. I felt terrible and asked for a retake. I studied pandas thoroughly as that was the one thing I had no experience in, but the second test didn't even have pandas questions, it had a simple fizzbuzz-type problem, some question regarding numpys again (which I got right, but I hadn't converted the original array to np.array, which got me a zero lol), For the fizz buzz type question, I messed up badly by using `if` instead of `elif`.\n\nI asked for one last try. The third test (10) questions were incredilby easy, I thought they felt pity for me lol, then came question 11 and 12, 11 had pass some argument or something to a parser, I honestly didn't even understand the question and 12 had me converting a sentence to numbers, like tokenization. I got the logic right, but couldn't remember the syntax for removing punctuation. Unfortunately, CoderPad doesn't give partial credit, so I failed again. Now I'm seriously doubting my abilities. In my mind, its like I can just look up this information ( syntax about removing punctuation) is it really fair for me to get a zero on this?\n\nEven though my manager has had no complaints and my performance reviews have been good, I'm suddenly experiencing major imposter syndrome. Missing these simple questions is making me spiral. I'm worried that without the title change, I won't get promoted, or worse, might lose my job.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. The self-doubt is really impacting my productivity and emotional state\n\nEDIT: My day to day doesn't really involve lot of coding nowadays, its mostly shipping features from existing codebase and just migrating it with some minor adjustments. Fixing bugs and talking with the stakeholders to see what kind of results are they expecting. Even when I do this, I can always test/debug, but its pretty much not possible to debug on the 'coderpad' tests. ",

In the weekends, i just want to lie down, do nothing and spend time with my family.\n\nI see other developers working relentlessly, always trying to stay up to date in their spare time, learn about frameworks, be a constant \"yes\" man and put up with their managers' bs, work in the weekends.\n\nAnd here I am, just want to complete my tasks, collect paychecks, have a life. It's not like I do not want to improve, I truly do. But I don't have the energy. Sometimes i even feel like quitting my job and I know that's dumb, given the current state of job market and I'm supposed to be grateful to even have a job because many don't. I am grateful, but I am also tired. Tired to constantly stare at a screen and not finding fulfillment.\n\nSo, I have to ask, is there something wrong with me?

Every framework or library we produce aims to reduce the amount of work we have to spend to achieve some result.\n\nThe western world represents  15-20% of the population, and we can imagine the remaining 80% catching up will keep on producing more and more engineers as years go by, especially as long as IT is considered the holy grail of sure employment and high pay.\n\nWith software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ? A moment where, full stop, we'll have too many CS trained people, and every extra million trained CS graduate will mean an extra million CS trained person not working in a CS related field. It sounds like it could be brutal.\n\nAnd it seems like most majors already went through this stage.\n\nWhy not CS ?\n\n",

It doesn't mean that you cannot get a job in the tech industry, but it would be a more difficult path in some career fields. Most students who pursue the BA are usually looking to bring an understanding of tech into a less technical field (like in Psychology, for example). \n\n  \n[https://www.unlv.edu/provost/svpaa/accreditation](https://www.unlv.edu/provost/svpaa/accreditation)",

I've gotten admittedly very lucky and have found steady work, either freelance or full-time. My stack is Django, React, Laravel and basically you get the idea - I'm a web dev.\n\nHowever, I don't really see myself doing this for 3 other years. I'd like to transition to a role that's more similar to hands-on, dealing with real world systems like I don't know, vehicles for example. Things you can see and touch and see working, you know? Web dev is good and pays the bills, I'm comfortable enough that I can afford a trip every now and then while taking out the gf, but I'd much rather work with something I can see and touch.\n\nThe obvious suggestion is blue-collar work, but I'd like to use my programming experience somehow, and was wondering what gateways / courses I could start getting into to facilitate that transition. My experience as web dev is solid, but things like micro-controllers and such I have any (although I have worked with C++).\n\nAnyone can suggest a potential gateway for that? I have a degree in Systems Engineering and I don't mind learning and working, I've done it all these years, but I really want to transition into a role that requires me to be more present and still pays well/decently. I thought about transitioning to a Solutions Architect or PO, but once again, ideally I want something more hands-on.\n\nObligatory \"english is not my first language\" disclaimer btw.",

Liquid comp would be slightly lower, but there’s big upside in equity… if they succeed it would be better than the current job, if they corner the European market it could be life-changing. \n\nI'm afraid of overvaluing the equity or minimizing the stress of working at a start up in my late 30s, and I don't want to burn bridges and then burn out to later be forced to take a worse job than I have now. Also while I am personally confident they are positioned to do well and believe them when they say they have no plans on getting acquired, there's no guarantee of the equity becoming liquid or ultimately being worth much.\n\nPersonal considerations:I have a mortgage, some debt, and family plans, so stability matters. At the same time, I feel a bit stuck where I am and like the idea of working on something bold. Also the idea of getting a huge payoff is obviously attractive.\n\nAny advice or different points of view would be appreciated!",

I've recently discovered that AI is really cool and it goes way beyond using chat for my homework assignments lol, so I've been researching a lot about careers in AI and found that I was particularly interested in ML!\n\nI majored in AI my freshman year at Purdue - West Lafayette, and now I've transferred to Rutgers - New Brunswick for the rest of my college career majoring in Data Science. I'm planning to graduate in 3.5 to 3 years, and so far, I'm on track to do so.\n\nMy most relevant courses are a data engineering in python course, a general OOP course, calc 2, stats 2, and discrete math. I have an unpaid \"internship\" at some fintech startup this summer where I used \"python and AI agent tools to automate workflows\", but we don't really do anything so that's basically just resume filler.\n\nMy main \"experience\" is from doing projects on my own. I listed them below:\n\n1. I made a linear regression model from scratch and trained it on the WHO life expectancy data, and found it matched scikit-learn's model pretty much exactly.\n2. I fine-tuned an open-source LLM on better completing inspirational English quotes and pushed it to HuggingFace.\n3. I'm currently working on this but I'm almost done; but I'm implementing the transformer architecture described in the research paper \"Attention is All You Need\" from scratch.\n\nI have heard usually people start off as data engineers/scientists and work their way up to becoming an ML engineer, and I know that you need knowledge with cloud services, containerization, generally good engineering practices, etc. etc. I'm sure you need solid DSA skills too.\n\nGiven my background, I was basically wondering what my next steps are here. Obviously I'd love to secure a more relevant, paid internship, but beyond that, what do I need to do in order to achieve my end goal? What things should I focus on at what times in order to best optimize my career path for the future?\n\nI'd really appreciate whatever advice you guys give, because I really want to make sure I'm doing the right thing.

For example certs in AWS, Kubernetes, Oracle, cloud, etc. for gaining detailed familiarity on tool and environments an organization might use?\n\nI’ve seen the usual recommendation of creating something that is impressive and unique to show off your talent. I definitely need to get to this as my university’s assignments were not very impressive, but I also like the idea of getting something tangible like a certificate.\n\nMy current company is kind of tech related and offers all the study materials for free for practically all certs available. I just have to pay for the test I think. So, paying for a cert is not an issue. \n\nCertificates won’t make me a mid-level dev, but it will show initiative and that I’ve done what I can on my end.\n\nLastly, do FAANG certs help to get into FAANG? I know FAANG is not the only place to aspire to be at, but I just wanted tho throw that out there.\n\nAny advice? \n\nThank you.",

I've been working in Aerospace/Defense world for about 11 years now, starting as an electronics technician then working my way into a hardware test engineer role, designing test fixtures and circuit boards, writing test procedures and test reports and documentation, things like that. At some point in that test engineer role, I basically got test automation software development thrust upon me since the company I'm at doesn't take software particularly seriously. But I absolutely fell in love with it, it's completely changed my life. It's like I finally realized what I want to be when I grow up, you know?\n\nSo that was about 2.5 years ago that this flame was lit, and since then I have been obsessing with software. Self-studying all the time, learning design patterns, trying new stuff. Getting pretty good at it, in my opinion, while also doing it professionally. I convinced my employer to let me move into a software role (eventually--it was a VERY slow move) and now I'm basically a software test engineer--as in, I write all the software that we use to test our hardware. I also do some stuff with CI pipelines now, though that's quite new to me AND to this organization. I may be starting a new position soon as an SDET at another Defense-like company, doing much the same thing, but much more exclusively software, and within an organization that takes software a lot more seriously.\n\nAll this to say that I have a couple of years of experience at this point, let's say. But I have no degree, and that makes getting jobs outside of the Defense world generally difficult (And I'd really like to get out of defense at some point). I've been working on my degree--slowly--at my local community college. In about a year-ish, I will be eligible to transfer somewhere else and I have some options and I want some advice from other people who've been in the software world longer than I have.\n\nThe way I see it, I have three viable options here:\n\n* **CSU Monterey Bay** offers an online computer science degree and is a more traditional route from a more reputable institution and may look better on my resume (I could also preserve my pretty kick-ass GPA, which makes me feel good as a historically piss-poor student). This is my plan currently.\n* **Southern New Hampshire University** may be a quicker means to an end here, and offers even more flexibility and is also cheaper, but potentially less reputable than a traditional institution like CSU-MB.\n* **Western Governors University** is like SNHU but on steroids. I can probably knock out 80% of the curriculum in a couple of weeks if I just go hard at it, because I really do know a lot of this stuff already. But it doesn't strike me as particularly reputable.\n\nGiven my experience, what do you think? Should I go with a WGU or SNHU type of school to check the box faster and be done with it? Or should I stay on my current path of going to the CSU, despite that it would take me something like 4 years from now (even after two years of community college) to get it? I'm 36, so not terribly old, but I also have kids and stuff, so getting done sooner would be nice so that I can have that time back sooner, but I also don't want to take shortcuts that will bite me in the ass later.\n\nSorry for the long post! I always have -vvvv flagged haha.\n\n**TLDR:** I have lots of overall technical experience and about 2.5 years of direct software experience, seeking a degree--should I go the long route with a reputable traditional institution or something fast and loose like WGU/SNHU to check the box?",
