Now, we're using LLMs that are more flexible but make many more mistakes.\n* Fuzzy Matching: Matching strings, like customer names, was a deterministic process. LLMs are being used instead, and they're less accurate.\n* Data Categorization: We had fixed rules or supervised models trained for high-accuracy classification of products and events. The new LLM-based approach is simply less precise.\n\nThe technology we had before was accurate and predictable. This new direction is trading reliability for perceived innovation, and the business is suffering for it. The board doesn't want us to apply specific solutions to specific problems anymore; they want the magical LLM black box to solve everything in a generic way.",

But those are built for Python or Java. That means if you want to use them in a browser-based app, you either:\n\n* Stand up an API to call them, or\n* Run a Python runtime in the browser via something like Pyodide (which feels a bit heavy when you just want some metadata in JS 🥲)\n\nThis got me thinking — there’s still a pretty big gap between **data engineering tooling** and **front-end use cases**. We’re starting to see more tools ship with WASM builds, but there’s still a lot of room to grow an ecosystem here.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve run into similar gaps.\n\nIf you want to check it out (or see a partially “vibe-coded” demo 😅), here are the links:\n\n* [Repo](https://github.com/nickBes/meta-sql)\n* [Demo](https://nickbes.github.io/meta-sql/)\n\n**Note:** The library is still experimental and may change significantly.",

Is DuckDB really a database? I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. \n2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS. ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post (4 weeks ago), to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.\n\nAlthough still in Early Access, now it should be completely bug free and everything works as it should. From now on I'll focus solely on building features requested by players.\n\nGame now teaches:\n\n1. Linear algebra - vector-matrix multiplication, complex numbers, pretty much everything about SU2 group matrices and their impact on qubits by visually seeing the quantum state vector at all times.\n2. Clifford group (rotations X, Z , S, Y, Hadamard), SX , T and you can see the Kronecker product for any SU2 group combinations up to 2\\^5 and their impact on any given quantum state for up to 5 qubits in Hilbert space.\n3. All quantum phenomena and quantum algorithms that are the result of what the math implies. Every visual generated on the screen is 1:1 to the linear algebra behind (BV, Grover, Shor..)\n4. Sandbox mode allows absolutely anything to be constructed using both complex numbers and polars.\n5. Now working on setting up some ideas for weekly competitions in-game. Would be super cool if we could have some real use cases that we can split in up to 5 qubit state compilation/ decomposition problems and serve these through tournaments.. but it might be too early lmk if you got ideas.\n\nTL;DR: 60h+ of actual content that takes this a bit beyond even what is regularly though in Quantum Information Science classes Msc level around the world (the game is used by 23 universities in EU via [https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/](https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/) ) and a ton of community made stuff. You can literally read a science paper about some quantum algorithm and port it in the game to see its Hilbert space or ask players to optimize it.\n\nImprovements in the past 4 weeks:\n\nIn-game quotes now come from contemporary physicists. If you have some epic quote you'd like to add to the game (and your name, if you work in the field) for one of the puzzles do let me know. This was some super tedious work (check this patch update [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english) )\n\nBig one:\n\nWe started working on making an offline version that is snycable to the Steam version when you have an internet connection that will be delivered in two phases:\n\nPhase 1: Asynchronous Gameplay Flow\n\nWe're introducing a system where you no longer have to necessarily wait for the server to respond with your score and XP after each puzzle. These updates will be handled asynchronously, letting you move straight to the next puzzle. This should improve the experience of players on spotty internet connections!\n\nPhase 2: Fully Offline Mode\n\nWe’re planning to support full offline play, where all progress is saved locally and synced to the server once you're back online. This means you’ll be able to enjoy the game uninterrupted, even without an internet connection\n\nWhy the game requires an internet connection atm?\n\nSingle player is just the learning part - which can only be done well by seeing how players solve things, how long they spend on tutorials and where they get stuck in game, not to mention this is an open-ended puzzle game where new solutions to old problems are discovered as time goes on. I want players to be rewarded for inventing new solutions or trying to find those already discovered, stuff that requires online and alerts that new solves were discovered. The game branches into bounty hunting (hacking other players) and community content creation/ solving/ rewards after that, currently. A lot more in the future, if things go well.\n\nWe wanted offline from the start but it was practically not feasible since simply nailing down a good learning curve for quantum computing one cannot just \"guess\".",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This article and many others say that Databricks is much faster/cheaper than Snowflake.  \n[https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b](https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b)\n\nSo I am new to Databricks, and still just in the initial exploring stages. But I have been using Snowflake for quite a while now for my job. The thing I dont understand is how is Databricks faster when running a query than on Snowflake.\n\nThe Scenario I am thinking is - I got lets say 10 TB of CSV data in an AWS S3 bucket., and I have no choice in the file format or partitioning. Let us say it is some kind of transaction data, and the data is stored partitioned by **DATE** (but I might be not interested in filtering based on Date, I could be interested in filtering by Product ID).\n\n1. Now on Snowflake, I know that I have to ingest the data into a Snowflake Internal Table. This converts the data into a columnar Snowflake proprietary format, which is best suited for Snowflake to read the data. Lets say I cluster the table on Date itself, resembling a similar file partition as on the S3 bucket. But I enable search optimization on the table too. \n2. Now if I am to do the same thing on Databricks (Please correct me if I am wrong), Databricks doesnt create any proprietary database file format. It uses the underlying S3 bucket itself as data, and creates a table based on that. It is not modified to any database friendly version. **(Please do let me know if there is a way to convert data to a database friendly format similar to Snowflake on Databricks).**\n\nConsidering that Snowflake makes everything SQL query friendly, and Databricks just has a bunch of CSV files in an S3 bucket, for the comparable size of compute on both, how can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? What magic is that? Or am I thinking about this completely wrong and using or not knowing the functionality Databricks has?\n\n  \nIn terms of the use case scenario, I am not interested in Machine learning in this context, just pure SQL execution on a large database table. I do understand Databricks is much better for ML stuff.",

It is more of a watch and try to do it yourself type of setup. Over time I have built a decent number of reports and have become one of the few people on the team who consistently does actual work. Out of a team of 10 it feels like only about three of us really contribute. Honestly it is kind of crazy.\n\nThe biggest issue I am dealing with is the most senior guy on the team. For some reason he seems to have it out for me. I have taken feedback from plenty of stakeholders without any problem. They treat me with respect. But this guy is never happy with anything I do. I can follow his instructions exactly and he still finds something to criticise. He has even called me names in front of the team and regularly insults my work. I am not claiming to be the best data engineer in the world but I do put in the effort. Meanwhile there are people on the team who have not done real work in months yet he treats them like gold.\n\nThe tricky part is that despite how he treats me he is the only person I can really go to for help because he knows everything. The problem is if he is wrong about something he will just double down and act like he is right. For example last week he claimed we could not use Power BI for a report because the stakeholder’s PC could not handle it even though I am pretty sure most of the heavy lifting is done by PowerBI.com.\n\nThe team has been together for over 30 years so even if I went to HR I doubt anyone would back me up. And the newer people would not want to stir the pot since they have it easy getting paid for doing almost nothing.\n\nI have mentioned my concerns to my line manager and he says that I am being to sensitive to the feedback on my work and its just how the guy is. There may be some truth to that, but its kinda hard to take feedback when every other comment is laced with a snide/condescending comment \n\nSome of the team members say that he's been talking about me on calls for hours after I leave, and I told him that it makes me feel like I am not safe here, to which he said \"That's because you are not safe x\" and the entire call went silent. \n\n  \nI also kinda wanted to ask if anyone had gone down the HR path before with this kinda problem? any advice appreciated",

Lot of times meetings get hijacked by some very trivial things, Saying a bunch of hypothetical things but adding nothing of value.Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. Is this how a normal functioning team looks like? How do you deal with such team members? Sometimes I feel I should just ignore which i do to a degree when it does not impact my work but then ultimately it is causing delays in delivering the project which is very much doable within the timelines. There is definitely atleast 1 person on the team who is a complete misfit for a data engineering role however for god knows why they choose that person. It does seem like typical corporate BS where people portray they are doing a lot when they are not. Apologies for the rant but like I said sometimes it really gets on my nerves with the way this team operates.\nJust looking for tips how to tackle such members/culture and should some of this \"in efficiencies\" be called out to my manager?",

        "content": "Hi\nI work on core data ingestion project which is the gateway for all internal/external data providers’s data to come through. Our data platform is completely built on data bricks. \nWe have a basic UI that is built using retool. This UI handles users upto 1000 (light weight operations), and it currently uses dynamoDb as its backend. We are planning to move to Azure in future, so wondering which back end database would be a good choice. Our top options are Postgres and mongoDb. Postgres is less expensive, and offers good features of a traditional transactional database.\nHowever,  dynamoDb to Postgres migration would require a lot of functional changes as we move from a Nosql to an RDS. \nCould someone please weigh in like pros and cons of these two?\n\nAnother unusual idea floated was - using data bricks as the backend for the UI. Though I am not a fan of this idea only because of the fact that Databricks is an analytical database, not sure how it might handle concurrency of UI application. \nBut, I might be wrong here, is Databricks good at handling these concurrent requests with low-latency ? Need everyone’s valuable opinion here.\n\nThanks in advance. ",

It's built in Rust using Apache Arrow and DataFusion, so it's pretty fast for large datasets.\n\nSome of the things it can do (there are currently more than 30 commands):\n\n* Basic data inspection (head, tail, schema, metadata, stats)\n* Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, sampling, deduplication)\n* Quality checks (outlier detection, search across columns, frequency analysis)\n* File operations (merging, splitting, format conversion, optimization)\n* Analysis tools (correlations, binning, pivot tables)\n\nThe project has grown to include quite a few subcommands over time, but honestly, I'm starting to run out of fresh ideas for new features. Development has slowed down recently because I've covered most of the use cases I personally encounter.\n\nIf you work with Parquet files regularly, I'd really appreciate hearing about pain points you have with existing tools, workflows that could be streamlined and features that would actually be useful in your day-to-day work\n\nThe tool is open source and available through simple command `cargo install nail-parquet`. I know there are already great tools out there like DuckDB CLI and others, but this aims to be more specialized for Parquet workflows with a focus on being fast and having sensible defaults.\n\nNo pressure at all, but if anyone has ideas for improvements or finds it useful, I'd love to hear about it. Also happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation.\n\nRepository: [https://github.com/Vitruves/nail-parquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/nail-parquet)\n\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the self-promotion.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance.\n\n**The Current Situation:**\n\nWe have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.\n\nThis architecture has led to two major problems:\n\n1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.\n2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.\n\n**My Question:**\n\nHow can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.\n\n**ETL Details:**\n\n* The entire pipeline is written in Python.\n* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily). The main pain point is the constant manual effort required to adapt to schema changes.\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions",

        "content": "Hey, I used to work at a Scala Spark shop, and we cared a lot about code optimization, we avoided writing UDFs, ensured the vast majority of operations were using the Dataframe API when possible, and although sometimes we had to leverage UDFs that was the exception. We ran all our jobs in batch and were able to run ETL jobs where data was in the 100s of GBs in 10-15 minutes. I recently got a new job at a Java Spark shop, and we use the spark streaming API. Our code starts with a foreach, and all of our code base is assuming we're operating on a single row. But then I took a java spark udemy course and it seems like it's teaching the very thing we're doing in java. But we end up streaming \\~20gb of data and our jobs take hours. Now I know we don't even really need to use spark with data that size, but given we have a spark code base, I guess I just have a few questions:\n\n1. Is it normal in java spark to use foreach and treat each row differently, and does the java spark engine recognize common transformations written in foreach and leverage it to create a plan that operates on the larger dataframe in a performant fashion? Is the scala logic of ensuring we focus on Dataframe operations rather than row-level UDFs the same in Java?  \n\n\n2. Is java spark, if written well, less performant than Scala Spark?\n\n  \n3. Is it possible that the streaming part could make Spark less performant when looking at \\~20gb of data? We're streaming data in json format via Kafka, whereas our Spark Scala batch jobs at my old company were using data both sourced from and creating new parquet files.\n\n  \n2. ",

Assets can be populated using the CLI, API or Terraform\n* Interactive lineage graphs\n\nIf you want to check it out, I have a really easy quick start that with docker-compose which will pre-populate with some test assets:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/marmotdata/marmot \n    cd marmot/examples/quickstart  \n    docker compose up\n    \n    # once started, you can access the Marmot UI on localhost:8080!

The company I work for is pretty weird, and I'd bet most of the work I do is not quite relevant to your typical data engineer. The layman's way of describing it would be a data wrangler. I essentially capture data from certain sources that are loosely affiliated with us and organize them through pipelines to transform them into useful stuff for our own warehouses. But the tools we use aren't really the industry standard, I think?\n\nI mostly work with Python + Polars and whatever else might fit the bill. I don't really work with spark, no cloud whatsoever, and I hardly even touch SQL (though I know my way around it). I don't work on a proper \"team\" either. I mostly get handed projects and complete it on my own time. Our team works on two dedicated machines of our choice. They're mostly identical, except one physically hosts a drive that is used as an NFS drive for the other (so I usually stick to the former for lower latency). They're quite beefy, with 350G of memory each, and 40 processors each to work with (albeit lower clock speeds on them).\n\nI'm not really sure what counts as \"big data,\" but I certainly work with very large datasets. Recently I've had to work with a particularly large dataset that is 1.9BB rows. It's essentially a very large graph network, with 2/2 columns being nodes, and the row representing an outgoing edge from column\\_1 to column\\_2. I'm tasked with taking this data, identifying which nodes belong to our own data, and enhancing the graph with incoming connections as well. e.g., a few connections might be represented like\n\nA->B\n\nA->C\n\nC->B\n\nwhich can extrapolate to incoming connections like so\n\nB<-A\n\nB<-C\n\nA<-C\n\nWell, this is really difficult to do, despite the theoretical simplicity. It would be one thing if I just had to do this once, but the dataset is being updated daily with hundreds of thousands of records. These might be inserts, upserts, or removals. I also need to produce a \"diff\" of what was changed after an update, which is a file containing any of the records that were changed/inserted.\n\nMy solution so far is to maintain two branches of hive-partitioned directories - one for outgoing edges, the other for incoming edges. The data is partitioned on a prefix of the root node, which ends up making it workable within memory (though I'm sure the partition sizes are skewed for some chunks, the majority fall under 250K in size). Updates are partitioned on the fly in memory, and joined to the main branches respectively. A diff dataframe is maintained during each branch's update, which collects all of the changed/inserted records. This entire process takes anywhere from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the update size. And for some reason, the reverse edge updates take 10 times as long or longer (even though the reverse edge list is already materialized and re-used for each partition merge). As if it weren't difficult enough, a change is also reflected whenever a new record is deemed to \"touch\" one of our own. This requires integrating our own data as an update across both branches, which simply determines if a node has one of our IDs added. This usually adds a good 20 minutes, with a grand total maximum runtime of 1.3 hours.\n\nMy team does not work in a conventional sense, so I can't really look to them for help in this matter. That would be a whole other topic to delve into, so I won't get into it here. Basically I am looking here for potential solutions. The one I have is rather convoluted (even though I summarized it quite a bit), but that's because I've tried a ton of simpler solutions before landing on this. I would love some tutelage from actual DE's around here if possible. Note that cloud compute is not an option, and the tools I'm allowed to work with can be quite restricted. But please, I would love any tips for working on this. Of course, I understand I might be seeking unrealistic gains, but I wanted to know if there is a potential for optimization or a common way to approach this kind of problem that's better suited than what I've come up with.",

        "content": "Hello.\n\nI work as a PM in a small company and recently the management asked me for a set of BI dashboards to help them make informed decisions. We use Google Workspace so I think the best option is using Looker Studio for data visualization. Right now we have some simple reports to allow the operations team to download real-time information from our database (AWS RDS) since they lack SQL or programming skills. The thing is these reports are connected directly to our database so the data transformation occurs directly in Looker Studio, sometimes using complex queries affects the performance causing some reports to load quite slowly.\n\nSo I've been thinking maybe it's the right time for setting up a Data Warehouse. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea since our database is small (our main table storages transactions and is roughly 50.000 rows and 30 MiB). It'll obviously grow, but I wouldn't expect it to grow exponentially.\n\nSince I want to use Looker Studio, I was thinking on setting up a pipeline that replicates the database in real time using AWS DMS or something, transfer the data to Google BigQuery for transformation (I don't know what the best tool would be for this) and then use Looker Studio for visualization. Do you think this is a good idea, or would it be better to set up the data warehouse entirely in AWS and then use a Looker Studio connector to create the dashboards?\n\nWhat do you think?",

Currently I am doing select queries on both tables ( I have a boolean which showcases if the record has been replicated (for both table). To fetch the record, then I see if the record based on a UID column exists in the destination table. If not, i insert (currently the one table can insert before the other, which leads to the other source table to do a update on the UID). So, when the records (UID) exists, i need to update certain columns in the destination table. Currently I am looping (python) through the columns of that record and doing a update (on the specific column). The table has 150+ columns, the process is being triggerd by Eventbridge (for both source tables), and the proicessing is being done in AWS Lambda. THe source tables are both PostgresSQL (in our AWS enviroment) and the destination table is also PostgresSQL on the same Database, just a different schema. \n\nTHe problem is, this is a heavy Load processing for Lambda.

The gig is for three months but there would likely be more work after the three months but obviously there’s zero guarantee.\n\nContractor role doesn’t really have healthcare and no pto so it would be a raise per hour and since the work is deliverable based rather than a corporate 9-5 I’ll have more flexibility to take time off as long as my work is keeping up.\n\nI think this current contract gig is probably pretty stable, there was a round of layoffs recently but I’m on a pretty critical tech project so I could probably just coast here if I wanted to but it’s been made reasonably clear that fte conversions are gonna be on hold since the purse strings are held pretty close.

I wanted to create a data pipeline utilizing this, and I finally finished it with hours of tinkering with docker. You can see the code here: [https://github.com/rohand2290/cytoscape-data-pipeline](https://github.com/rohand2290/cytoscape-data-pipeline).\n\nIt supports exporting a graph of associated proteins involved in glutathionylation and a specific pathway/disease into a JSON graph that can be rendered into Cytoscape.js, as well as an SVG file, through using a headless version of Cytoscape and FastAPI for the backend. I've containerized it into a Docker image as well for easy deployment with AWS/EC2 eventually.  ",

The frontend is nearly done and I am planning on optimizing my pipeline. \n\nHowever I do have another idea for a project but I don't know if it is possible. \n\nContext \n\nMy project is related to MMA. Essentially there is a term called \"MMA Math\". It's a derogatory term used to diminish one-dimensional analysis of upcoming fights. \n\nEssentially just because fighter A beats fighter B and fighter B beats fighter C, it doesn't necessarily mean fighter A beats fighter C. \n\nThis is because fighting style, age, psychology and chance all play a role. \"Styles make fights\" as the saying goes. \n\nHowever, no one has ever concretely proven or disproven MMA math. It could just be confirmation bias.\n\nObjective -\n\nCreate a database that tracks all fights between all fighters. Add weights for fights that occur higher up in rank, fights that happen in their prime and between fighters who already fought each other. The fights will also have meta data like how it ended, strikes and takedown landed etc.\n\nQuestions -\n\nI'm not too sure but I think a graph database would be a good place to start as graphs represents relationships between nodes.\n\nHowever, I want this project to look good on my CV and I know graph databases are not very popular and in-demand in the market.\n\nI also don't know how queryable graph databases are.\n\nLikewise, I don't know where to get the data from.\n\n\n",

Our main bottleneck is running and merging two separate queries, one for KNN and one for BM25, which currently results in an average response time of 7–10 seconds.

        "content": "# Been coding for 5ish years, talked to about a dozen beginners here - some real talk\n\nHi all,\n\n(Get my 5-Year Dev Career Roadmap:  Month-by-month skill progression, Project ideas by experience level, When to apply for jobs (with confidence levels here → \\[[Substack](http://typedweekly.com)\\].)\n\nI've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.\n\n**Stop obsessing about languages**\n\nEveryone's like \"which language should I learn???\" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.\n\nJS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.\n\n**What companies acutally look for**\n\nI've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.\n\nYour starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.\n\nOne of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.\n\n**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**\n\nOne legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.\n\nIf you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?\n\nAs for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.\n\n**Find ppl who get it**\n\nYou need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.\n\nStack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!\n\nI was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.\n\n**Just. Pick. Something**\n\n\"People keep saying mixed things about X\" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.\n\nEvery \"wrong\" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.\n\nAlso don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.\n\n**The secret sauce**\n\nConsistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.\n\nI still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like \"damn I'm good at this\". It's normal.\n\nHit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.\n\nEdit 1:  \nBeen getting a bunch of dмs with similar questions — I’ll write small posts on Medium / [Substack](http://typedweekly.com) so it’s easier to share in next days.",

I spent so long trying to figure out which things I could edit without globally editing other components. Some of the local/global style sheets I couldn't figure out where they were applicable to other components until further digging. \n\nAnd then there was the issue of the UI library itself and it's own self-imposed CSS rules. I wrote what felt like the most ridiculously specific selectors just update some simple component UI because otherwise, nothing worked. \n\n  \nHonestly, if I could've just coded it in bare HTML/CSS/JS, it probably would've taken 30 minutes at max. Instead, it took me half a day. Am I just really slow?",

For someone just starting their programming journey now, what would you recommend they focus on?\n\n\n\nSome specific questions I'm wondering about:\n\n\n\n\\- Are traditional fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc.) still as crucial when AI can handle a lot of implementation?\n\n\\- Which programming languages or technologies seem most future-proof right now?\n\n\\- What soft skills or ways of thinking are becoming more important as the technical barriers lower?\n\n\\- How should new programmers approach learning alongside AI tools rather than competing with them?\n\n\n\nI'd love to hear from both experienced developers and fellow newcomers about what you think will matter most going forward. What are you focusing your learning on, and what gaps do you see in the current market?\n\n\n\nThanks for any insights!",

Dynamic typing does not even serve its own special purpose. You want polymorphism: use inheritance. You want a beginner-friendly language: well then why would you abstract away something as important as data types. Why does dynamic typing exist?",

Visualizing how they behave in memory made stuff like recursion and pointers suddenly make sense. I also began explaining my solutions to myself, and every time I stumbled, it exposed what I didn’t really understand. However, if you wanna make great progress, you also need feedback to every explanation. I used Beyz for record and suggestions,but there are many similar software available on the market now. You can choose the one that is the most affordable.   \n\nLater, I tried re-implementing basic structures in 3 different languages, Python, JavaScript, and Java, just to separate concept from syntax. It helped a ton.\n\nNow, I spend more time on *why* a solution works than memorizing *what* the solution is. It feels slower, but it’s way more durable.\n\nAnyone else go through this shift?

        "content": "I'm a CS student who's really into metacognition and how people learn programming. I get to see lots of students at university and talk with them about their code (sometimes JavaScript), and I've noticed something that I think is a huge problem.\n\nThe fundamental concept that causes the most trouble for beginners is that **they don't understand evaluation** \\- what it actually means to evaluate an expression until it becomes a value.\n\nPeople always say universities are rigorous and full of definitions, but they (or at least my university) seem to completely fail at teaching the definitions that actually matter. I can't count how many friends have told me that programming suddenly \"clicked\" once they understood these basic definitions:\n\n* **Value**: an expression that evaluates to itself\n* **Evaluation**: transforming an expression, step by step, into a value\n\nOnce you get this, everything else builds naturally. Assignment makes sense because it's basically a function that takes two arguments: a name and a value. If there's an expression on the right side, you have to evaluate it first, step by step. Functions only accept values, so arguments have to be evaluated first - boom, functional composition becomes way easier to understand. and same for functions calls, because the student start seeing the call as an operator that takes a function on its left, not just syntax to memorize.\n\nLater when you study first-class functions, a statement like \"functions are values\" actually makes sense. Students start asking the right questions: \"But what kind of value? How does it look?\" And that naturally leads to closures and understanding that the value contains a reference to the environment where the function was defined.\n\nHere's the thing - I truly believe understanding these basic concepts early helps students ask the right questions. When they face something unexpected with a new expression, the first thing they think is \"How does this evaluate? There must be some evaluation rules.\"\n\nI think all CS 101 classes should start with (or at least teach at some points) these fundamentals: evaluation, values, the difference between statements and expressions, etc. Instead we get thrown into syntax and algorithms without understanding what's actually happening under the hood.  \nWhat do you think?  \nEdit: I wrote [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mlnc7i/comment/n7ti6se/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) explaining what I meant by evaluation with an example, I think it might help",

And what is ok to learn on the job?\n\nTwo caveats before we dive into the question.\n\n1. I understand it's a really bad time for Juniors right now.  I understand even Doctorate level people are looking for work unsuccessfully.\n2. I understand the journey never really ends, and the number of things you could learn is near infinite.  That's what draws me to this field in the first place.\n\nWith those understood I'm curious how much is enough for Junior Developers? I recently got to the last 4 interviewees for an entry level job and I was rejected for being weaker than the others on the technical side.  So I know this isn't a normal time in software, I just want to know how far off I am.\n\n* I can build a REST API CRUD app in Javascript & Python.\n* I know the basics of environment management and I can set up Node, Express, Django, etc. in both languages.\n* I'm a little more proficient in Javascript understanding some of those runtimes and frameworks at a deeper level including styling with Tailwind & Bootstrap as well as using Node & AJAX to set up Asynchronous data management to recieve input from the user then display the JSON/XML.\n* I'm familiar with basics setting up logic in the REST API Routes such as using findOne to search by UUID so that you can set up a view page for each entry in your API.\n* I'm already using error handling with try/catch methods to look for errors and send to an error page.\n* I can use React to set up a vite project and use it to manage state dynamically.\n* I can deploy the app via my AWS EC2.\n* I'm proficient with Git & Version control with a couple dozen repositories and over 400 commits.\n\nI plan on doing some Unit Testing and getting more practice with my debugger next, but I'm feeling rejected after getting so close and hearing \"Not enough\"\n\nEdit: Since a couple people asked about education.\n\nI do have a college degree in Business Administration, and I did a 12 week 60+ hour weeks intensive co-op on the basics of web development. Do you think that would be sufficient? Or should I plan on getting a second major in my future.\n\nI grew up in a very poor area, and neither my high school or early college had a CS program.  The place I transferred to had one, but by then, I was tunnel visioned on finishing.  I fell in love with technology and programming about two years ago.",

Codefinity’s step-by-step lessons were great for breaking down concepts into manageable chunks, and I found the small projects really helpful for practicing what I learned.\n\n\n\nThat said, it’s not perfect some parts felt slow, and if you’re already confident with basics, you might find it a bit repetitive. Still, it gave me the structure and confidence to move from “I know Python syntax” to actually building things I can show.\n\n\n\nFor those interested, my goal is to eventually work in robotics, and I’ve been using a Raspberry Pi alongside the course to try out small hardware projects. The combination has been helpful to connect coding with real-world applications.\n\n\n\nI’d love to hear from others who’ve tried Codefinity did it help you move forward?

I have already completed my diploma back in 2020, and gotten mostly through my BSc, and finished more than 90% of the program. Because of a recent change in my financial situation, I need more cash in order to finish it. I want to get work that uses the skills I learned, specifically in low-level languages such as C, C++, or assembly, and leverages my knowledge of network security.\n\nAfter consulting with people who know more about the hiring process than I do, I was told that the projects I have on my resume are not sufficient evidence of said skills. Because of this, I have to work on projects that would resolve this issue. I was advised to volunteer for organizations that would need computer science skills. There are a couple of options I came up with independent of the career agent's advice, but upon their review they only gave encouragement:\n\n* Contribute to open source projects\n* Create an indie game\n\nObviously the path towards creating an indie game is, at the high level, straightforward. In spite of this, such games require time and creativity to reach completion. For that reason I have decided that while it's an okay idea, it would be best if I expand my resume through more than one vector.\n\n* [https://up-for-grabs.net/#/](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)\n* [https://goodfirstissue.dev/](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)\n* [https://www.codetriage.com/](https://www.codetriage.com/)\n* [https://github.com/ravendevteam/betanet](https://github.com/ravendevteam/betanet)\n* [https://kernelnewbies.org/](https://kernelnewbies.org/) (NOTE: Subject is about developing patches to the linux kernel.)\n\nThat leads me here. I have opened some sites for open source projects that require assistance in the links above. However, I am lost as to how I would be able to digest the requirements given to me in regards to what these projects want, and convert them into a list of chores for me to follow through on.\n\nSo how would I accomplish that?\n\nI will not consider taking a minimum wage job to attempt to stabilize my finances. The effect it would have on my schedule would be irrecoverably debilitating, and it will not resolve my financial difficulties. I also have enough mental health problems to deal with as-is, and this will worsen them.",

I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on why this happens.\n\nIs it simply because they're a \"safe\" and established choice? Are there specific technical advantages that make them so popular, or is it a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where everyone learns them because they're popular, which in turn makes them more popular?\n\nOn a related note, this got me thinking about languages that were once super popular but have since fallen out of favor. For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options? Was it a lack of features, performance issues, or did other languages just innovate faster?\n\nI'd love to hear your insights and experiences! No wrong answers here, just genuinely curious about the community's perspective. Thanks in advance!",

I’ve always been curious about low-latency systems, multithreaded programming, and how real-time trading platforms manage high-throughput workloads efficiently.\n\nTo explore these topics hands-on, I built a mini trading engine in C++. It’s a simple simulation right now — it includes:\n\n* An order book with support for basic market and limit orders.\n* Matching logic for buy/sell orders.\n* A basic mean-reversion strategy (just for testing).\n* Multithreaded architecture: one thread ingests mock market data, another executes strategy logic.\n* Data structures optimized for quick access and low overhead.\n* Performance benchmark scores and graphs to showcase real performance.\n* Basic tests to make sure every build runs smoothly.\n\nIt’s very much a work in progress and far from perfect, but building it has taught me a ton already about threading and performance bottlenecks in real-time systems.\n\nI don't have any idea how C++ code is written in a professional environment so I’d really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for what I could improve. Whether it’s around architecture, C++ patterns, or trading engine design principles — I’m all ears.\n\nThanks in advance, please give my project a star if you like it!\n\n[Link](https://github.com/ArjunXvarma/mini-quant-trading-engine) to the project.",

I feel like I’ve learned nothing useful and want to explore different areas to find my interests.\n\nSo far, we’ve only programmed in C, and I *think* I lean toward low-level programming, but I’m not sure. Should I build on my C knowledge or try web dev? Most final projects (third year is where you present a final project) at my uni are web-based, but I’d like to stand out.\n\nI need advice on what project or what to learn, and how to prepare for a strong final project. Any guidance would be appreciated!",

        "content": "https://inventwithpython.com/blog/leap-of-faith.html\n\nI've written a short tutorial about what exactly the vague \"leap of faith\" technique for writing recursive functions means, with factorial and permutation examples. The code is written in Python.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.\n2. Next, implement the base case.\n3. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.\n4. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.\n5. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.\n\nI also go into why so many other tutorials fail to explain what \"leap of faith\" actually is and the unstated assumptions they make. There's also the explanation for the concept that ChatGPT gives, and how it matches the deficiencies of other recursion tutorials.\n\nI also have this absolutely demented (but technically correct!) implementation of recursive factorial:\n\n    def factorial(number):\n        if number < 0: raise Exception('number must be a positive integer')\n        if number % 1 != 0: raise Exception('number must be an integer')\n\n        if number == 100:\n            # BASE CASE\n            return 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000\n        elif number < 100:\n            # RECURSIVE CASE\n            return factorial(number + 1) // (number + 1)\n        else:\n            # ANOTHER RECURSIVE CASE\n            return number * factorial(number - 1)",

        "title": "[Project] My first actually useful C# project – a simple wallpaper switcher (WinForms/.NET 9)",
        "author": "YangLorenzo",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone! 👋\n\nI'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!\n\n#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?\n\nA minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.\n\n**Core Features**:\n* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.\n* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.\n* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.\n* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.\n* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.\n* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.\n* **Two wallpaper switch modes**:\n  * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching).\n  * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).\n\n#### Why I built this\n\nAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.\n\nOriginally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.\n\n--- \n\n**What’s new in 3.0.0**\n\n* ✅ Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)\n* ✅ Hotkey system\n* ✅ Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom\n* ✅ Better folder switching logic\n* ✅ System tray + auto-start support\n* ✅ UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below 👇)\n\n---\n\n**About the UI**\n\nI initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.\n\nI uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.\n\n---\n\n**Architecture decisions**\n\n* **Two-project structure**:\n\n  * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs).\n  * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).\n* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.\n* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.\n\n---\n\n**Tech stack**\n\n* C# (.NET 9)\n* WinForms\n* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)\n* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)\n\n---\n\n📦 **Project & Source Code**\n👉 GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)\n\nAny feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.\n\nThank you all for reading! 🙏\nIf you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!\n",

        "content": "I guess it's more of a productivity question. Often times, I find myself wanting to build multiple projects, contribute to existing ones, or learn new technologies. The problem is I can only focus on one task at a time. These tasks usually require deep focus, making it impossible to effectively switch between them.\n\nFor example, I have a couple of pet projects, and when I return to either of them to make some changes, it always feels like starting from scratch - learning the codebase again, figuring out the code logic. Every time.  \n  \nAnother example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time.   \n  \nI'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them? Maybe it's a silly question, but I'm genuinely curious how other people stay productive in these situations.",

From what I see I think companies nowadays value specialization more than  generalization.

I tried surfing subreddits for similar experiences but always came across mixed opinions. \n\nOverall, I like backend and I’m willing to learn it with Python or Java (my cs classes will be taught in either of these), JavaScript is cool but I don’t think it’s healthy to learn with a tool I’m not passionate in using. \n\nJust a knowledge list of where I’m at rn, I’m very beginner level rn:\n- variables & data types\n- conditionals\n- functions\n- currently learning control flow & data structures\n\n\n",

How do you prevent them from containing too much or too little information?\n\n\n\nAny other advice for Agile?",

        "content": "I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.\n\nThat’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.\n\nSo yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.\n\nI know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Here are a few examples\n\nGoogle Current Employees: 187K, 2019 Employees: 119K **57% higher**\n\nMeta Current Employees: 76K, 2019 Employees 45K **68% Higher**\n\nMicrosoft Current **US** Employees: 126K, 2019 Microsoft US Employees 96K, **31% Higher**\n\nAnd I could post a ton more examples, but I think you should all get the point. I also specifically said US employees for MSFT, because I know the first comments would be \"yeah but all the jobs are in India now\" otherwise.\n\nAnd to put these numbers into context, the overall US population grew by about 4-5% during this time. All the hair on fire shit here is not based in reality.",

        "content": "Over a month ago, we had a regression testing deadline coming up. My manager reached out to me on Saturday to work on some bugs . I told her I was out of town and couldn’t work — which was true. I’ve got four kids and my weekends are usually packed, especially with no notice.\n\nThe following Monday in standup, she brought it up — saying she should have communicated earlier, but also added that she expected the team to step up and work weekends to meet deadlines. I mentioned  I wouldn’t be available the coming  weekend either if that’s what she was expecting. It was my son’s birthday weekend. They worked til  midnight that Saturday.\n\nFor context: my manager has always been happy with my work. She’s consistently appreciated my contributions and never had any complaints about my performance. The only “issue” seems to be that I don’t volunteer for extra work. lol. She’s made comments in the past like she wants me to “see the bigger picture” and help other teams.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she asked if I’d be available the second weekend of September for another deadline. At the time, I said I should be. But since then, my wife made plans for that weekend, so I updated my manager and told her I wouldn’t be available anymore in case she needs people to work.\n\nShe wasn’t happy and said something like, “I can’t keep asking the same person to work on weekends,” referring to a coworker who regularly puts in 50–60 hours. I replied, “That’s a personal choice. I already stretch my weekdays beyond 40 hours. I choose to spend weekends with my family. If every release requires weekend work, then we have a process problem.”\n\nNow I’m brushing up my resume. Haven’t interviewed in over 10 years……\n",

        "content": "We need a tax policy that favors hiring in America. Raise the corporate tax rate and then give tax rebates to companies for every dollar they spend hiring in the US. This will help every industry that's facing outsourcing - tech, accounting, project management, all the jobs that people want!\n\nEdits:\n\n1. We are not taxing outsourcing itself as that's hard to implement. We are raising the whole corporate tax rate and then giving tax rebates to companies that show a large American payroll. This puts the burden of proof on the company to show they are hiring Americans. Harder to loophole this.\n2. This is more like EV/Clean Energy incentives rather than tariffs. It's a transfer payment from American companies that outsource to American companies that hire Americans.\n3. This is not targetting H-1Bs/immigrants. H-1Bs are separate but atleast they recycle money back into the American economy. I get it that PhDs and top talent should come to the US, I am not targetting H-1Bs but rather targetting outsourcing.\n4. Rich tech companies that earn more money will get hit harder by corporate tax rate and thus need a larger American payroll to get credits. How much Americans a company needs to hire is proportional to the amount of money they make.\n5. We are hiring the best. We want to make an 150k American salary = 40k Overseas Salary + 110k in missed rebates. Now that both hiring and Americans and overseas cost 150k, please hire the best.\n6. No extra tax cost to give rebates. The funds come from higher corporate tax rate. It will be a transfer payment from outsourcing companies to ones that are hiring American.\n7. It's a free market, but why do big oil, big pharma, military industrial complex get protectionism but American citizens don't?",

It's always been that way.\n\nThe problem isn't leetcode, because as stupid as the whole concept is fundamentally, I'm at least good enough at it to be able to handle them with some modicum of confidence, in spite of it being completely irrelevant to any work in the field.\n\nThe problem isn't interviews, because in spite of this job being fairly insular (although not as much as most people believe), I have good soft skills from my last job especially being very interactive with many different teams.\n\nThe problem is that *I fucking hate what tech has become in 2025.*\n\n90% of job ads are for gambling sites, crypto sites (but I repeat myself), or AI bullshit that's draining society for every penny it's worth while putting people out of their jobs without any plan for what happens when vast swathes of the population are trained in unemployable fields. It's feeding into a regime that I will withhold my feelings about so as not to get too political, but suffice it to say I vehemently disagree with. \n\nThe rest of the job ads are so hotly contested and so few and far between that I have barely any shot of competing for them, and even those jobs are still mildly problematic, but at least it's only in the same old ways that they've always been (ie. Banking, marketing).\n\nSorry if this has been said before by others but the feeling of needing to sell my soul to these companies that are speedrunning societal destruction makes me want to throw myself into a river rather than prostrate myself at their feet hoping a little bit of their plundered wealth trickles into my pockets.",

        "content": "The 2025 StackOverflow Developer Survey just dropped, and as someone who's been tracking these trends for career planning, I wanted to share the actionable insights.\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\nBased on 49,000+ developer responses across 177 countries, here's what's happening in the industry (not just the hype):\n\n**High-Priority Skills (Proven ROI):**\n\n1. **Python**: +7 points year-over-year. If you're not learning Python in 2025, you're missing the boat. It's dominating AI/ML, data science, and increasingly backend development.\n2. **Docker**: +17 points (highest single-year increase ever). Container literacy is now a basic requirement, not a nice-to-have.\n3. **Cloud platforms**: Still growing steadily across AWS, Azure, GCP\n\n**The AI Skill Paradox:**\n\nHere's what the survey reveals about AI: usage is up, but trust is down to 60%. Translation for your career:\n\n\\- Learn to collaborate WITH AI tools, don't depend ON them\n\n\\- Develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it\n\n\\- Focus on verification, architecture, and strategic thinking\n\n**Technologies to Consider (But Don't Panic About):**\n\n\\- Rust: Growing but still niche\n\n\\- Go: Solid for specific use cases\n\n\\- Kubernetes: Important for infrastructure roles\n\n**Technologies That Remain Solid:**\n\n\\- JavaScript: Still the most widely used\n\n\\- PostgreSQL: Database of choice\n\n\\- Git: Universal (obviously)\n\n**My Practical Advice:**\n\n* **If you're starting out**: Learn Python first, then JavaScript, then Docker\n* **If you're mid-career**: Add containerization and AI collaboration skills to your existing stack\n* **If you're senior**: Focus on architecture and team leadership while staying current with Python/containers\n\n**Career Strategy:**\n\nDon't chase every new framework. The survey shows that sustained success comes from mastering fundamentals and selectively adopting innovations that solve real problems.\n\n**The numbers don't lie**: developers with Python + Docker + cloud skills are seeing the most opportunities right now.\n\nWhat's your experience? Are you seeing these trends in your job search/interviews?\n\nI wrote a more detailed breakdown with specific learning resources.

I had been at the company for a little over 2 years at that point and had purchased a house in October of the year before. The first few months, I wasn’t that worried, I had rented out the house and was also doing Airbnb to keep the mortgage payments covered. I was interviewing and hearing back, getting ghosted, getting reached out to by recruiters. My former company had a career counselor program for everyone who was laid off, but obviously it yielded no success. Winter came, airbnb bookings were low and I really started to feel the pressure. April came around again and I started to just feel like a straight up failure.\nAnytime people would talk about CS (I did computer engineering tho not that it really matters) being a dying field now or just about how horrible the job market was, I just didn’t think much of it because I figured there would always be something.\nI honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I was in a forbearance period for my mortgage but the forbearance period is over and I’ve missed 2 payments. I got a notification in the mail from my mortgage company with a pamphlet about “Tips to avoid foreclosure”. It feels like there’s a noose around my neck. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t want to ask my parents (who I live with) for money because it seems like money is tight right now, but I know they would find the money if I did ask. I just feel so hopeless, it’s like nothing is working. I have no money. I don’t even respond to my friends anymore because I’m tired of telling them that I have no money. I’m in credit card debt too from the money I spent to furnish my airbnb. It’s like no one around me can even comprehend how much money occupies my mind. I’ve been going outside in nature a lot more recently and in those moments it feels like everything will be okay but then I get home and I remember.\nHonestly I’m kind of tired of typing so I’m gonna stop here, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit.",

        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"\n\nIn the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.\n\nFor the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.\n\nThroughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.\n\nFast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. \n\nAt 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.\n\nNo full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"\n\nHonestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\"  today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. \n\nSide note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.\n\nIs it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?\n\nI just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

I was tasked to create a bottom sheet using a Figma design as a reference. I got too caught up in the functionality, which I did implement correctly for the most part. But the bottom sheet was supposed to show over all the other components in the UI, which I forgot to do. My team lead reviewed the task and pointed it out to me.\n\n2. I created another bottom sheet that was supposed to have a certain appearance in both landscape and portrait mode. I was able to implement it correctly, and tested it in both orientations, as well as landscape -> portrait and portrait -> landscape (or so I thought). Later, it was discovered that despite my thorough testing, i missed the portrait->landscape scenario, leading to the UI looking bad. Once again, an obvious mistake that should have been avoided and pointed to me by my team lead.\n\nIt is a problem because \"needs to get better at testing\" has appeared far too many times in my performance review which comes every 3 months and instances like these are cited to me far too often.\n\nWe only get performance based increments, and because of this, I have never been able to get one, as I believe their perception of me is \"Makes too many obvious mistakes\".\n\nI have tried the advice of \"write down all test cases beforehand\", but as scenario 2 shows, even that doesn't stop me from making errors like those.\n\nI seem to have hit a wall, one that I can't get over.\n\nHas anyone ever faced a problem like this before?

The more intense, algorithm-heavy, grindy SWE work doesn’t excite me.\n\nWhat I am really good at is managing, organizing, and coordinating. I thrive when I’m planning, running projects, and keeping people on track.

I spent my summers hanging out with friends, doing artsy projects, watching TV, basically nothing “competitive” or career-boosting. Now I’m feeling the weight of that.\n\nPart of the problem is that I’ve had almost zero exposure to what jobs are actually like. My dad’s retired and never really talked about work, my brother just tells me to “focus on learning and chill,” and I’ve never been in an environment where I could see what a day in a tech or PM role is like. Any time I think about doing a personal project, I feel like it’s pointless because there are already better versions out there and mine won’t be “competitive” enough.\n\nI just feel… lost. I don’t have genuine interest in what I’m learning right now, I don’t have a clear vision of what kind of job I’d like, and I feel like I’m already behind compared to my peers.\n\nIf you’ve been in this position, what did you do? How do I figure out what I might actually enjoy and build toward it without wasting more time? Is SWE → PM really the only path if I don’t want to code forever?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've kinda run into this a few times and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong\n\nAt one job, I had a manager who seemed extremely suspicious of me. This job had near impossible standards to meet, so I'd be fixing roughly 10-20 tickets a day every day working \\~7am to \\~5pm. I told him explicitly I can't work from 5PM - 7PM, but could work after that. Despite this, every single time the manager would have a meeting with me, he would ask these questions that seemed to imply I wasn't working. He would say things like \"where are you working from\", \"when did you start working today\", \"how many hours have you been working\", stuff like that\n\nHe tried scheduling a meeting at 6pm my time. I told him, I could not make it to this time and he would have to schedule it at either 4pm or 7:30pm. He took a heavy amount of offense to this and started saying some cryptic stuff about how it's not acceptable that I \"disappear\" at that time. I didn't want to explain to him the reason (why's it his business?), but I had to have this time off to do physical therapy due to a busted hip, which will prep me for a surgery. I simply can't put this off, because it was causing a lot of pain\n\nFinally, I think the \"breaking point\" was one day when I woke up at 6am and looked at my phone to see a bunch of notifications from around 2AM, one after the other, asking me if I was online. I messaged back (at now 6AM) and said I just woke up, was it something urgent? He said it wasn't, but I should have been awake. I was not on call. Anyway, I ended up getting fired and when I asked HR why, they said I \"disappeared\". I asked for any tangible proof and pointed at the github contributions, which were every hour 7am-5pm every weekday. They did not respond\n\nSimilarly, I just got a new manager at my company who seems to be doing the same thing. She's constantly saying I'm not doing enough, not doing the right thing, \"not working\", but when I ask for tangible examples, she will not provide them. To counter, I show an exact audit of everything I did over the past few weeks, which was at least 2-5 tickets per day with correspondence over slack. She still says she's upset by it\n\nThis doesn't seem to help, at all. Like every time I bring up \"actual proof\", it feels like that just makes the problem so much worse. What am I supposed to do in this situation?",

I went to college. I did the work. I have the degree. I want to work and make money. I’m dedicated and ambitious, but that is not enough for this career. I need some guidance. I’m at a halt and feel so hopeless. I feel that my career is going down the drain. I’m in more debt now than I was when I was a teen and working at a coffee shop. \n\nEndless amount of studying for a few interviews that have gotten me nowhere.

I'm going to lay out my career path, how I got here, and essentially ask for help on what I need to do to get out of this dead end in the next six to 12 months.\n\nVery long story short, one unexpected kid at 20 and I didn't get my college degree until 2019 at the age of 33. It was incredibly brutal to get there but I had a compsci degree from the University of Minnesota.\n\nDespite that, all of my efforts at job fairs were a bust. My best guess was my age was a factor, but I can't know. Regardless, the only job I could get my hands on at graduation was for a local embedded linux hardware company of \\~400 employees for \\~$70k. It was a bit of a tough pill to swallow given all of the guys I studied with (and often performed better than) landed at either Amazon or Target for significantly more money.\n\nI got some moderate Yocto experience and enough C++ to know I'd rather write in straight C than untangle legacy bowls of spaghetti. Covid hit almost immediately after I was hired and my subpar wage dipped into straight up rough territory within a year. When they called me back into the office I said no and flailed to look for a new job.\n\nThat too was utterly brutal. I only really had \\~1.5yrs of Yocto/embedded experience and was still very green. The only job I could find was a remote gig in another embedded device company in Fargo. The pay was $100k. It wasn't great, but it was a raise, and they promised me I would continue my embedded Yocto experience. This struck me as a deal as I could continue to transport my kids to school and work on the same skillset. Id eventually be a marketable embedded developer in +/- 3 years I felt.\n\nIt was also a lie. I never, ever touched anything embedded, leaving all of my experience at my first job to largely rot before I could get it to the magic \"5 years\" point. Instead it was secretly full Reactjs/Swift/XCode/C# userspace server code. I now have \\~3.5 years of that when my company was bought and I was thrown out of that team into a.... yocto embedded team. I now have 6 more months of experience there. Most of that time was spent remembering things I had completely forgotten.\n\nI have been looking for a job to get off this roller coaster since early 2023. I barely even get callbacks. I've gotten two interviews. One was a dud, the other was a trap that offered me $80k without asking me a single tech question. I know this Reddit is aware of the pitfalls and stressors of looking for a job in this field right now so there is no reason to go further.\n\nMy work history is essentially in shambles and looks horrible on paper from all this thrashing. Both companies do not have names that make my resume stand out in any meaningful way. I realize (or presume) that the only way out for me is to work all day, then code all night and create a portfolio in a space that mildly interests me.\n\nI have been working in Rust, which I thoroughly enjoy, and have been messing around in Ratatui crate, which I also enjoy, but work is slow between two high school kids I teach how to drive simultaneously, being the one breadwinner, the one adult that drives, and the one person who does household shopping and cooking. I am too stretched thin to not be attacking this with maximum efficiency.\n\nI need to stop wandering in the dark and find the straightest line possible to get me out of my stagnant job/wage. I came to this whole industry late and dont have either the best discipline or sense on how one furthers their career as quickly as possible and becomes marketable in the most effective way, and I'm up to my eyeballs in all the extraneous \"life\" stuff that is non-negotiable. I basically need a road map.\n\nThank you for spending any amount of time on that. I am 100% serious and have the work ethic, I just don't have the direction. I appreciate any constructive first steps.",

It's strange. Even though I expected at some point that I might not get any return offer but I don't know why am I still disappointed and depressed right now.

I do know whats a big O and i can give a few examples , just not quick sort, not off the head.\n\nAt the coding assessment i forgot the syntax of Array's method(js). \n\nThey were very much asking me obscure methods that are very rarely used. You have to be the kind of person who memorize the documentation to know all the available methods.\n\nDo i really have to memorize the documentation? For all those who excel at technical interviews, what should i be doing to not get surprised by questions like these.\n\n",

        "content": "Hey guys, I studied Math and Data Science and interned at top investment banks and quant firms. i wanted to switch into tech from finance. There’s always a lot of info on interview prep but some seem unrealistic. I never took a DSA course or learned Neural Networks in university. I just landed a software engineer (Machine Learning) position a year after I graduated. Here’s how I prepped in around 6 months to be FAANG and big tech ready.\n\nBook: A common sense guide to data structures and algorithms (ruby and javascript) i use python and this book is fine \n\nCourse: Leetcode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course\n\nYoutube: Andrej Karpathy Zero-To-Hero\n\nNeetcode 150: did around 100 problems twice. That was enough for me but I studied Math so my problem solving skills were already kind of high\n\nFor the MLE position it was a mixture of leetcode, OOP, and neural network architecture. Had to build a Multilayer Perceptron model from scratch in PyTorch (didn’t prep for this at all but i pulled through). Had a medium leetcode type of problem for first round.\n\nTips: Be consistent but you don’t have to do 1000 problems to break into FAANG. MOCK INTERVIEW. leetcode isn’t enough to be good in a technical interview. I did a mock technical interview 1-2 times a week for 3 months straight. \nYou need a good resume to break into FAANG there isn’t a way to just break into FAANG. Your linkedin and resume needs to be peak.  ",

I like to see how everything connects, not just code but tech, people, economic and social systems. I’ve had a rough few years between life setbacks, grief, and demoralising work environments. I feel like I've stagnated and lost confidence in my abilities, or never really developed them further than university level.\n\nI’ve held two jobs since graduating:\n\n* One was an \"application specialist\" role, mostly user support and QA testing - no real development. (1.5 years) \\[Australia based\\]\n* My current job is a support engineer role maintaining legacy WinForms tools in C#. I fix minor bugs, occasionally touch Blazor or SQL, but I wouldn’t even know how to build one of these apps from scratch. There's little mentorship, PRs only get reviewed by the boss once per week if you're lucky, and every other team member is spread thin.

I was the only new person to last longer than two weeks in three years. My boss often humiliated me which wrecked my self-worth, and I find it hard not to feel panic that I’m falling behind while everyone else is moving forward.\n\nThat said, I have done a few things I’m proud of:\n\n* At uni, I had a job building Python software for Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., an NFC security system, e-ink display widgets). I don’t have access to these any more.\n* I’ve participated in two blockchain hackathons (first a team of three which I led/did most of the project, and second I did solo), working with Solidity and JavaScript. Both times something went wrong at the very end and I couldn’t demo properly, but I want to revisit those projects and finish them.\n* I’ve also started writing about cybernetics, AI, and cognitive security/cogsec on my blog.\n\nI have so many project ideas, but I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know whether to double down on the blockchain stuff, explore AI/ML (I’d even go back to uni if I felt it was the right path), or start a new project using something more marketable like React. I often feel FOMO seeing the focused, driven people on this sub. I know I’m capable and think deeply, but I feel stuck and don’t know where to aim.\n\nI’ve also been able to find a few thinkers/leaders online who I look up to. In 2023 I flew internationally to a tech conference and networked with, met and conversed at length with the founders and staff of this company, which is probably the highlight of the last few years for me. This is the same company I did the hackathons for. In my mind, I’m working toward having some diverse portfolio that really demonstrates me and my strengths which I could present to any of these people and ask for mentorship.\n\nSo here’s what I’m hoping you might help me figure out:\n\n* How do I find a path in CS I can truly thrive in, that makes use of my strengths?\n* Should I try to finish the blockchain project or start fresh with something more mainstream like a React app?\n* Is it worth exploring AI/ML or systems design formally? Or should I just build, build, build and let the path emerge?\n* How do I rebuild confidence and skill after years of support roles and a toxic work environment?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thank you.",

Luckily the job market was strong and I was able to find good paying jobs. I even worked with a few people who did the same, or were even self taught, over the years. I have 8 YOE now.\n\nI've been at my current employer for 4 years now. But last year new management took over, and things have been slowly going downhill. I would be surprised if we made it another year at this point. So I've started applying for jobs. \n\nI take my time and tailor the resume and cover letter to the posting, and I'm only applying for ones that I'm a good fit for. Despite this, I get rejected automatically. My best guess is that I'm being filtered out based on my degree. Even when it comes to posting that say they'll take equivalent experience. Even if the job only requires 4 years of experience and pays less than what I currently make.\n\nThe problem is that I have a family and a mortgage and all that now, so I can't just drop everything and go back to school. I could do online classes, but there's no way I would be able to finish a degree before this company folds. What do I do?",

        "author": "Suspicious_Stable_25",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Long story trying to keep it short,\n\nI joined this company about 4 years ago. From the very beginning it was a shit show.\n\nThey lured me in with this \"hot\" tech team and then when I got there the team was \"full\" so I had to find a different team. One of the managers found me a spot on this abysmal graveyard team with super outdated tech. It would take 30 minutes just to login to their stuff and get environment running and I am not kidding. No one wanted to learn new technology. Working on tech 10+ years old. Did great there but eventually couldn't take it anymore and joined a new team.\n\n  \nMuch better team but still had lots of issues. Ended up becoming the \"lead\" without the title even helping out engineers with 15+ years of experience on me. All the while I'm talking to the person in charge of my promotion and it's constant excuse of \"just perform really well on this team for 6 more months\" yada yada. I do great for 3 years. Then the person leaves the company with no notice. I get a new person in charge of my promotion and he's not a technical guy at all. Promotion time is coming up and the last guy told me this new guy knows everything about my promotion case.\n\n  \nI bring it up to him and he has no idea what I am talking about. Then he goes and talks to someone in my org who is non-technical, has no idea what I do and I literally have never talked to. He proceeds to tell me she said I don't step up for leadership positions yet I am basically leading my team. I was pissed she even answered, she should have talked to someone who actually knew what I did. Also, I am the lowest level engineer and leadership is not even required for the next position. Then he leaves for paternity leave for 3 months while promotions are happening. So I literally have no one to vouch for my promotion case during promotions and I am pissed. I am outperforming the more senior engineers and getting paid significantly less.\n\nFed up, I reach out to an old manager and tell him my scenario. He says that's horrible and says he'll take me under his wing for the promotion case. \n\nThen my company decides to move me to a different team the week after promotions but I am still in the same org, just a different team/product due to politics/finances basically.\n\nI tell my new person in charge of my promotion this and he basically says I might need to perform well for another 6 months for a promotion. I said it wasn't even my choice to switch teams and I've been overperforming my position for the past 3 years and they switched me because in their words \"I was the best engineer\". I basically tell him this 6 months stuff is bs. He says he will talk to his manager and see what he can do. \n\nAt this point I am so fed up. There's literally no point in me even trying at my job anymore. Whether I am an absolute all-star or I slack off and work the bare minimum I get paid and treated the same. I am basically checked out of this job. It is by far the worst job I have ever had.\n\nI may be getting an offer for a new job soon. I told my partner that I don't even think this company deserves to know I am leaving because of how horrible they have treated me. It's clear they have no respect for me so why should I bother giving them 2 weeks notice or any notice at all?\n\nIs this bad for me to do? I hate burning bridges but they burned this bridge so long ago I honestly don't even think there is a bridge left to burn. I could go on and on about other awful things they have done, how cheap they are, no recognition for work, and so much more.\n\n  \nWhat would you guys do in my situation?",
