The point being that if one of these teams drops the ball, the blame still falls on the DE. \n\nI’ve had this expectation everywhere I’ve been. Some places are better than others in terms of how big the Data team can be and perhaps placing more responsibility on the downstream and upstream teams, but it’s generally never a “you are only responsible for this area”\n\nI’m rambling a bit but hopefully you get the idea.

Maybe 1000 rows. \n\nWhat is strategy for such joins in database.  We have been using just a dedicated program written in c++ that just holds all that data in memory.  Downside is that it involves custom coding, no sql, just is implemented using vectors and hash tables. Other downside is if this server goes down it takes some time to reload all the data.  Also machine needs lots of ram.  Upside is the query is very fast.\n\nI understand a type of aggregate materialized view could be used.  But this doesn’t seem to work if clauses added to where. Would work for a whole join though.\n\nWhat are best techniques for such joins or what end typically used ?\n\n",

Our team's trying to build out our analytics infrastructure and our IT department has set up **completely separate environments** for DEV, UAT, and PROD including:\n\n* Separate Snowflake accounts for each environment\n* Separate managed Airflow deployments for each environment\n* GitHub monorepo with protected branches (dev/uat/prod) for code (In fact, this is what I asked for. IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)\n\nThis setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:\n\n* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing\n* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated\n* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in Snowflake\n\nI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.\n\n# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:\n\n* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?\n* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?\n* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support\n* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to  generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?\n\nAgain, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful. \n\nThanks in advance for any insights and enjoy your rest of Sunday!",

That makes sense operationally — but it creates a disconnect because business users don’t care about processing time; they care about event time.\nTo complicate things further, it’s also recommended to keep your bronze layer append-only and handle deduplication downstream.\nSo, I have three main questions:\n1. How would you approach partitioning in the bronze layer under these constraints?\n2. How would you design an efficient deduplication view on top of the bronze layer, given that it can contain duplicates and the business only cares about the latest record?\n3. Given that there might be intermediary steps in between, like dbt transformations when going from bronze to gold. How do you partition data in each layer so that your pipeline can scale? \n\nIs achieving idempotentcy and deterministic behavior at scale a huge challenge? \n\nI would be grateful if there are any resources on it that you can point me towards too? \n\n",

Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all.

Another important point is that the company manages most workflows through events following a DDD (Domain-Driven Design) pattern.\n\nRight now, there’s a case where a process depends on two different Step Functions before triggering another process.\nThe challenge is that these Step Functions run at different times and don’t depend on each other.\nAdditionally, in the future, there might be other processes that depend on those same Step Functions, but not necessarily on this one\n\nIn my opinion, Airflow doesn’t fit well here.\n\nWhat do you think would be a better way to manage these processes?

        "author": "Mysterious-Sky5410",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working at a WITCH company for about a year now, as a Data Engineer. I’ve been in the same project throughout, where I mainly handle support tasks— documentation, debugging, adding columns, updating views, ensuring data flow, and just ensuring everything runs smoothly. Essentially, I’m not involved in any real development work like building pipelines or writing scripts.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of posts about people in similar situations, like the one here [Need career advice – Am I a Data Engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1nf3h0u/need_career_advice_am_i_a_data_engineer_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , and it feels like I’m in the same boat. The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.\n\nAnother challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.\n\nI see two possible options right now:\n\nAsk to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.\n\nResign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.\n\nSo, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here?   \n  \nI don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.\n\nAppreciate any insights or suggestions!\n\nTL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new. Should I ask to be released from my project (with no guarantee of better work) or resign and serve the notice period while job hunting (despite the risk of unemployment)?",

        "content": "Hey guys, looking for feedback on a potential setup. For context, we are a medium sized company and our data department consists of me, my boss and one other analyst. I'm the most technical one, the other two can connect to a database in Tableau and that's about it. I'm fairly comfortable writing Python scripts and SQL queries, but I am not a software engineer.\n\nWe currently have MS SQL Server on prem that was set up a decade ago and is reaching its end of life in terms of support. For ETL, we've been using Alteryx for about as long as that, and for reporting we have Tableau Server. We don't have that much data (550GB total), and we ingest about 50k rows an hour in batched CSV files that our vendors send us. This data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned up before a database can ingest it.\n\nWith the SQL Server getting old and our renewal conversations with Alteryx going extremely poorly, my boss has directed me to research options for replacing both, or scaling Alteryx down to just the last mile for Tableau Server. Our main purposes are 1) upgrade our data warehouse to something with as little maintenance as possible and 2) continue to serve our Tableau dashboards 3) make ad-hoc analysis in Tableau possible for my boss and the other analyst. Ideally, we'd keep our costs to under 70k a year.\n\nSo far I've played around with Databricks, Clickhouse, Prefect, Dagster, and have started doing the dbt fundementals courses to get a better idea of it. While I liked Databricks's unity catalog and time travel capabilities of delta tables, the price and computing power of spark seems like overkill for our purposes/size. It felt like I was spending a lot of time spinning up clusters and frivolously spending cash working out the syntax.\n\nClickhouse caught my eye since it promises fast query times, it is easy enough to set up and put together a sample pipeline together, and the cloud database offering seems cheaper than DBX. It's nice that dbt-core can be used with it as well, because just writing queries and views inside the cloud console there seems like it can get hairy and confusing really fast.\n\nSo far, I'm thinking that we can run local Python scripts for ingesting data into Clickhouse staging tables, then write views on top of those for the cleaner silver + gold tables and let Alteryx/analysts connect to those. The tricky part with CH is how it manages upserts/deletions behind the scenes, but I think with ReplacingMergeTrees and solid queries, we could get around those limitations. It's also less forgiving with schema drift and inferring data types.\n\nSo my questions are as follows:\n\n\n* Does my approach make sense? \n* Are there other products worth looking into for my use case?\n* How do you guys evaluate the feasibility of a setup when the tools are new to you?\n* Is Clickhouse in your experience a solid product that will be around for the next 5-10 years?\n\n\nThank you for your time.",

        "author": "Remote_Impact_8173",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!\n\nAssume I got a huge dataset of crawled internet webpages, and I'd like to transform them page by page doing some kind of filtration, pre-processing, tokenization etc. Let's say that original dataset is stored along some metainformation in form of parquet files in S3.\n\nComing from enterprises, I have some background in Apache ecosystem as well as some older Big Tech MapReduce-kinda data warehouses, so my first idea was to use Spark to define those transformations using some scala/python code and just deal with it in batch processing manner. But before doing it \"classic ETL-style\" way, I decided to check some more modern (trending?) data stacks that are out there.\n\nI learned about Modal. They seem to be claiming about revolutionizing data processing, but I am not sure how exactly the practical usecases of data processing are expressed in them. Therefore, a bunch of questions to the community:\n\n1. They don't provide a notion of \"dataframes\", nor know anything about my input datasets, thus I must be responsible for somehow partitioning of the input into chunks, right? Like, reading slices of parquet file if needed, or coalescing groups of parquet files together before running an actual distributed computation?\n\n2. What about fault-tolerance? Spark has implemented protocols for atomic output commit, how do you expose result of a distributed data processing atomically without producing garbage from restarted jobs when using Modal? Do I, again, implement this manually?\n\n3. Is there any kind of long-running data processing operation state snapshotting? (not saying about individual executors, but rather the application master) If I have a CPU intensive computation running for 24 hours and I close my laptop lid, or the initiator host dies some other way, am I automatically screwed?\n\n4. Are there tweaks like speculative execution, or at least a way how to control/abort individual function executions? It is always a pity to see how 99% of a job finished with high concurrency and last couple of tasks ended up on some faulty host and take eternity to finish. \n\n5. Since they are a cloud service - do you know about their actual scalability limits? I have a computation CPU cluster of \\~25k CPU cores in my company, do they have some comparable fleet? It would be quite stupid to hit into some limitation like \"no more than 1000 cpu cores per user unless you are an enterprise folk paying $20k/month just for a license\"... \n\n6. Also, them being non-opensource also makes it harder to understand what exactly happens under the hood, are there any open-source competitors to them? Or at least a way how to bring them on-premise to my company's fleet?\n\nAnd a more generic question – has any of you folks ever tried actually processing some huge datasets with them? Right now it looks more like a tool for smaller developer experiments, or for time-slicing GPUs for seconds, but not something that I would use to build a reliable data pipeline over. But maybe I am missing something. \n\nPS I was told Ray also became popular recently, and they seem to be open-source as well, so will check them later as well.",

        "author": "lancejpollard",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "General problem I'm been considering in the back of my head, when trying to figure out how to make some sort of interactive web UI for various language texts, and allow text annotation, and text editing (to progressively/slowly clean up the text mistakes over time, etc.). But in a way such a way that, if you or someone edits the text down the road, it won't mess up the annotations and stuff like that?\n\nI don't know much about linguistic annotation software (saw [this brief overview of some options](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/text-annotation-labeling-tools/#1-labellerr)), but what I've looked at so far are basically these:\n\n- [Perseus Greek Texts](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0227) (click on individual words to lookup)\n- [Prodigy demo](https://demo.prodi.gy/?=null&view_id=pos_manual) (on of the text annotation tools I could quickly try in basic mode for free)\n- [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/articulus) (double click to visit terms anywhere in the text)\n\nBut the general problem I'm getting stuck on in my head is what I was saying, here is a brief example to clarify:\n\n- Say we are working with the Bible text (bunch of books, divided into chapters, divided into verses)\n- The data model I'm considering at this point is a tree of JSON basically, `text_section` can be arbitrarily nested (bible -> book -> chapter), and then at the end are `text_span` in the children (verses here).\n- Say the Bible unicode text is super messy, random artifacts here and there, extra whitespace and punctuation in various spots, overall the text is 90% good quality but could use months or years of fine-tuned polish to clean it up and make it perfect. (Sefaria texts, open-source Hebrew texts, are super-super messy, tons of textual artifacts that could use some love to clean up and stuff eventually over time... for example.).\n- But say you can also annotate the text at any point, creating probably \"selection_ranges\" of text within or across verses, etc.. Then you can label or do whatever to add metadata to those ranges.\n\nProblem is:\n\n- Text is being cleaned up over say a couple years, a few minor tweaks every day.\n- Annotations are being added every day too.\n\nEdge-case is basically this:\n\n- Annotation is added on some selected text\n- Text gets edited (maybe user is not even aware of or focused on the annotation UI at this point, but under the hood the metadata is still there).\n- Editor removes some extra whitespace, and adds a missing word (as they found say by looking at a real manuscript scan).\n- Say the editor added `Newton` to `Isaac`, so whereas before it said `foo    bar <thing>Isaac</thing> ...   baz`, now it says `foo bar <thing>Isaac</thing> Newton baz`.\n- Now the annotation sort of changes meaning, and needs to be redone (this is a terrible example, I tried thinking of what my mind's stumbling on, but can't quite pin it down totally yet).\n- Should say `foo bar <thing>Isaac Newton</thing> baz` let's say (but the editor never sees anything annotation-wise...)\n\nBasically, trying to show that, the annotations can get messed up, and I don't see a systematic way to handle or resolve that if editing the text is also allowed.\n\nYou can imagine other cases where some annotation marks like a phrase or idiom, but then the editor comes and changes the idiom to be something totally different, or just partially different, whatever. Or splits the annotation somehow, etc..\n\nBasically, have apps or anyone figured out generally how to handle this general problem? How to not make it so when you edit, you have to just delete the annotations, but it somehow smart merges, or flags it for double-checking, etc.. Basically there is a lot to think through functionality-wise, and I'm not sure if it's already been done before. It's both a data-modeling problem, and a UI/UX problem. But mainly concerned about the technical data-modeling problem here.",

The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \\`BroadcastHashJoin\\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.\n\nI had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\\*\\*ks up the performance.\n\n**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.\n\n**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \\`date\\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.\n\nI have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",

It’s basically a modernized spin on the kind of work I do at my job, a Transaction Data Platform with a multi-step ETL pipeline.\n\nQuick overview of setup:\n\nDB structure:\n\nDimensions = Bank -> Account -> Routing\n\nFact = Transactions -> Transaction\\_Steps\n\nHistory = Hist_Transactions -> Hist_Transaction_Steps (identical to fact tables, just one extra column) \n\nI mocked up 3 regions -> 3 banks per region -> 3 accounts per bank -> 702 unique directional routings.\n\nA Python script first assigns following parameters to each routing:\n\ntype (High Intensity/Frequency/Normal)\n\ncountry\\_code, region, cross\\_border\n\nbase\\_freq, base\\_amount, base\\_latency, base\\_success\n\nvolatility vars (freq/amount/latency/success)\n\nThen the synthesizer script uses above paramters to spit out 85k-135k records per day, and 5x times Transaction\\_Steps \n\nAnomaly engine randomly spikes volatility (50–250x) \\~5 times a week for a random routing, the aim is (hopefully) the pipeline will detect the anomalies.\n\nPipeline workflow:\n\nBatch runs daily (simulating off business hours migration).\n\nEvery day data older than 1 month in live table is moved to history tables (partitioned by day and OLTP compressed) \n\nThen the partitions older than a month in history tables are exported to Parquet (maybe I'll create a Data lake or something) cold storage and stored. \n\nThe current day's transactions are transformed through DBT, to generate 12 marts, helping in anomaly detection and system monitoring \n\nA Great Expectation + Python layer takes care of data quality and Anomaly detection\n\nFinally for visualization and ease of discussion I'm generating a streamlit dashboard from above 12 marts.\n\nMain concerns/questions:\n\n1. Since this is just inspired by my current work (I didn’t use real table names/logic, just the concept), should I be worried about IP/overlap ?\n2. I’ve done a barebones version of this in shell+SQL, so I personally know business and technical requirements and possible issues in this project, it feels really straightforward.  Do you think this is a solid enough project to showcase for DE roles at product-based-companies / fintechs (0–3 YOE range)?\n3. Thoughts on using synthetic data? I’ve tried to make it noisy and realistic, but since I’ll always have control, I feel like I'm missing something critical that only shows up in real-world messy data?\n\nWould love any outside perspective\n\nThis would ideally be the portfolio project, and there's one more planned using spark where I'm just cleaning and merging Spotify datasets from different types (CSV, json, sqlite, parquet etc) from Kaggle, it's just a practice project to showcase spark understanding. \n\n**TLDR:**  \nBuilt a synthetic transaction pipeline (750k+ txns, 3.75M steps, anomaly injection, DBT marts, cold storage). Looking for feedback on:\n\n* IP concerns (inspired by work but no copied code/keywords)\n* Whether it’s a strong enough DE project for Product Based Companies and Fintech. \n* Pros/cons of using synthetic vs real-world messy data",

The decode complexity is quite high so these will probably match (rather than beat) Roaring throughput on bitwise ops once tuned, but their might be some value for memory-constrained and disk/network-bound contexts.  \n  \nWith an alternative simpler compression scheme I was able to reduce size by 23%, and expect the throughput will beat Roaring once the implementation is further along.",

I have met with Microsoft numerous times and have not gotten a straight answer. \n\nFor a long time we have had the BI tool decoupled from the ETL/Warehouse and we are used to be able to refresh models and re-run ETL/Pipelines or scripts in the DB in parallel, the DW300c size warehouse is independent from the \"current\" Power BI capacity. we have a large number of users, and I'm really skeptical that a P1 (F64) capacity will suffice for all our data related activities.\n\nWhat has been your experience so far?  To me migrating the models/dashboards sounds straightforward but sticking everything in Fabric (all-in-one platform) sounds scary to me, I have not had the chance to POC it myself to discard the \"resource contention\" problem. We can scale up/down in Synapse without worrying if it's going to break any Power BI related activities.\n\nI decided to post it here because looking up online is just a bunch of consulting firms trying to sell the \"product\".

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm seeking help with a bad situation I have with Synapse + Azure storage (ADLS2).\n\nThe situation: I'm forced to use Synapse notebooks for certain data processing jobs; a couple of weeks ago I was asked to create a pipeline to download some financial data from a public repository and output it to Azure storage.\n\nSaid data is very small, a few Megabytes at most. So I first developed the script locally, used Polars for dataframe interface and once I verified everything worked, I put it online.\n\n# Edit\n\nApparently I failed to explain myself since nearly everyone who answered, implicitly thinks I'm an idiot, so while I'm not ruling that option out I'll just simplify:\n\n* I have some code that reads data from an online API and writes it somewhere.\n* The data is a few MBs.\n* I'm using Polars, not Pyspark\n* Locally it runs in one minute.\n* On Synapse it runs in 7 minutes.\n* Yes, I did account for pool spin up time, it takes 7 minutes after the pool is ready.\n* Synapse and storage account are in the same region.\n* I am FORCED to use Synapse notebooks by the organization I'm working for.\n* I don't have details about networking at the moment as I wasn't involved in the setup, I'd have to collect them.\n\nNow I understand that data transfer goes over the network, so it's gotta be slower than writing to disk, but what the fuck? 5 to 10 times slower is insane, for such a small amount of data.\n\nThis also makes me think that the Spark jobs that run in the same environment would be MUCH faster in a different setup.\n\nSo this said, the question is, is there anything I can do to speed up this shit?\n\n# Edit 2\n\nUnder suggestion of some of you I then profiled every component of the pipeline, which eventually confirmed the suspicion that the bottleneck is in the I/O part.\n\nHere's the relevant profiling results if anyone is interested:\n\n\n### local\n\n```\n_write_parquet:\n  Calls: 1713\n  Total: 52.5928s\n  Avg:   0.0307s\n  Min:   0.0003s\n  Max:   1.0037s\n\n_read_parquet (this is an extra step used for data quality check):\n  Calls: 1672\n  Total: 11.3558s\n  Avg:   0.0068s\n  Min:   0.0004s\n  Max:   0.1180s\n\ndownload_zip_data:\n  Calls: 22\n  Total: 44.7885s\n  Avg:   2.0358s\n  Min:   1.6840s\n  Max:   2.2794s\n\nunzip_data:\n  Calls: 22\n  Total: 1.7265s\n  Avg:   0.0785s\n  Min:   0.0577s\n  Max:   0.1197s\n\nread_csv:\n  Calls: 2074\n  Total: 17.9278s\n  Avg:   0.0086s\n  Min:   0.0004s\n  Max:   0.0410s\n\ntransform (includes read_csv time):\n  Calls: 846\n  Total: 20.2491s\n  Avg:   0.0239s\n  Min:   0.0012s\n  Max:   0.2056s\n```\n\n### synapse\n\n```\n_write_parquet:\n  Calls: 1713\n  Total: 848.2049s\n  Avg:   0.4952s\n  Min:   0.0428s\n  Max:   15.0655s\n\n_read_parquet:\n  Calls: 1672\n  Total: 346.1599s\n  Avg:   0.2070s\n  Min:   0.0649s\n  Max:   10.2942s\n\ndownload_zip_data:\n  Calls: 22\n  Total: 14.9234s\n  Avg:   0.6783s\n  Min:   0.6343s\n  Max:   0.7172s\n\nunzip_data:\n  Calls: 22\n  Total: 5.8338s\n  Avg:   0.2652s\n  Min:   0.2044s\n  Max:   0.3539s\n\nread_csv:\n  Calls: 2074\n  Total: 70.8785s\n  Avg:   0.0342s\n  Min:   0.0012s\n  Max:   0.2519s\n\ntransform (includes read_csv time):\n  Calls: 846\n  Total: 82.3287s\n  Avg:   0.0973s\n  Min:   0.0037s\n  Max:   1.0253s\n```\n\n### context:\n\n`_write_parquet`: writes to local storage or adls.\n\n`_read_parquet`: reads from local storage or adls.\n\n`download_zip_data`: downloads the data from the public source to a local `/tmp/data` directory.

This semester, I started taking an entry level Python course required for my major, and honestly, I've never been this confused in a college class before as a junior.\n\nIt's been about two months, and I still feel completely lost. My professor teaches by using Microsoft Copilot to write all of the code, and then explains to the class what Copilot generated. I've been completing all my assignments using Copilot as well, since that's what the professor expects.\n\nHowever, one day we had a substitute professor who didn't use Copilot. He broke down each function and explained what everything did, and that was the first time I actually understood what was going on.\n\nLately, I've been seriously considering whether this major is the right fit for me. If this is what the rest of the program is like, i'm not sure I'll enjoy or even fully understand what I'm supposed to be learning. I don't want to switch majors just because of one bad experience, but it's starting to make me question if this field is really what I want to pursue longterm.\n\nSo now I'm wondering is this kind of Al heavy teaching normal for coding classes in 2025, and I'm just behind? Or is the professor not teaching correctly.",

Lately, I’ve been haunted by something. I watch senior developers work, navigating massive codebases, writing complex logic line by line by themselves with without AI, debugging like it’s second nature, and I’m in awe. They don’t lean on AI for every line, they just know. And I can’t help but wonder: Will I ever get there?\n\nHere’s the raw truth: I’ve relied on AI, tutorials, copy-paste solutions, and the environment around me encourages that. It’s fast, it works, but it’s not helping me learn, not really. I feel like I’m trading understanding for convenience, and it scares me that I might never reach the level of independence I admire in senior developers.\n\nI want to break that cycle. I want to think in code, solve problems from scratch, read a complex system and understand it fully. I want to be the programmer who doesn’t just get things working, but truly knows why and how.\n\nSo I’m asking you all:\n\n1. How do I build the mindset to stop relying on AI and tutorials for every step?\n\n2. What habits or exercises actually make you confident in writing code from scratch?\n\n3. How do you go from feeling lost in a project to navigating it like a second brain?\n\nI’m ready to put in the work. I just need direction and guidance from people who’ve been there.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "It's actually very good. I really enjoy how they make programming and computer science seem fun and simple, the professor is very good at explaining concepts no matter how difficult or unfamiliar they are. Things like memory management in C or data structures and algorithms were very easily explained, David Malan (the professor) is a very energetic and enthusiastic teacher but he explains his thoughts very clearly, he does a very good job at explaining these concepts visually and conceptually. Things that I was scared of getting stuck on became very simple once they were explained, David Malan is a very good teacher.\n\nI also really enjoyed the problem sets. They were very well made and thought out, they're not too easy like some of the other coding courses that say things like \"print hello world\", \"create a variable and print it\", no with CS50 every problem set is a mini-project(s). It's not too hand-holding like other courses where it feels like you're following instructions instead of building, no you get an explanation, you get a demo of how the final product should look, sometimes you get a short walkthrough or some hints, but at the end of the day it's all about you seeking the answer yourself and working through the problem. Some problem sets are unique and fun like I really enjoyed Fiftyville and Readability.\n\nExpanding on the last point, I really like how they focus on the problem solving aspect of programming.  As a developer you don't get paid to code but to solve problems. I really enjoyed how they didn't encourage AI to write code or to be the main source of learning, no they really want you to read documentation, research and do rubber duck debugging, they encourage figuring things out yourself and that is such an important skill to learn.\n\nAnother thing I enjoyed was how easy their tools were to use. Just make a Github account and connect it to the CS50 codespace. They document and explain their tools like submit50 and check50 very well. I think that if tomorrow you start CS50 and it's your first day programming, it would be very straightforward to get started with the CS50 tools.\n\nNow, the course isn't particularly easy, simple and easy aren't the same thing. If you have no experience with computer science then CS50 could be a bit difficult at first since they get you up and running QUICK, I mean they start talking about algorithms and memory management by around week 3 and 4 and so yeah this is definitely not a course that I would say is \"easy\", but the professor is very good at explaining concepts and if you just stay consistent and you keep going it'll be worth it. It actually gets easier from week 6 and onwards, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a great course. Heck, I wouldn't even be mad if this course costed money. If you're thinking of taking an easy to follow, free, fun course full of learning opportunities then I think CS50 is great, there is not really much of anything that I disliked, everything was super straight forward and simple.",

        "content": "Hi, the same old weekly question again. I don't want to commit half a year to JS to then move. I've been reading through lots of conversations and the general consensus is sort of mixed, but still slightly leaning towards JS fundamentals. I do understand that the official docs also send you off to learn JS, just unsure in what capacity.\n\nAny JS resource I've looked at is largely comprehensive and not something I want to commit to. I've of course done a lot of prior research over the past week and have decided on tools that are TS-first, like Vue or Solid and potentially Astro eliminating the need for Nuxt, where I think Fastify for the backend would be a nice tool to learn, or just go for Nuxt over Fastify if learning something more performant like Go Standard Library in the future.\n\nAs for TS resources, there's a couple that are thrown around, one of which is the official doc/handbook and the second is the Total TypeScript course, money isn't a concern in the slightest if the learning's worth it and I can come out of it being able to hold my own.\n\nI have a bit of C knowledge, nothing of exceptional note though. Would be nice to start learning something that's favored and will be favored in the future and is simply the better of the two rather than what's phasing out, at least in terms of writing code, although I do acknoledge that JS is still the underlying engine and holy grail.",

I get that AI has contributed to the layoffs, but I don't fully agree it is the only reason the hiring process is broken. I think it has a lot more to do with the economy and business side of things than it does with \"capabilities\".\n\nGetting a job has never been about \"yo, i can build advanced and cool software!!\" and yet people put too much emphasis on technologies and what can now be done almost as if the entire tech industry is one giant competition about who can do what the best.\n\nSo is AI really to blame here? Just seeking clarification. And if my take on the subject does matter, I would say it is important to be more business-oriented so you can understand the value you bring to companies because at the end of the day that is why we get hired. Nobody hires someone so they can have a salary. You just gotta prove to them that you are worth the investment.\n\nThese are just my thoughts but if I am wrong please do correct me :)",

        "content": "My son (10 years old now) started his coding adventure with the typical things that kids use - block based tools like scratch.\n\nWhen he outgrew those, he moved on to learn open web technologies.   His first two games were built using just HTML, CSS, JS using divs, images and sound apis.  Huge learning curve, and still limited in what you can do.  It didn't stop him though. More importantly, it taught him the fundamentals (arrays, variables, file management, functions, etc), and there's a lot of value in that.\n\nHe wanted to do more advanced stuff, and started learning how to use canvas with requestAnimationFrame. He even started thinking about what a collision detection algorithm would look like (with the help of AI). He never passed the experimentation phase here so a game wasn't released.  But he learned a lot more about the fundamentals.  \n\nIn all the above, he did have support & guidance from parents. So I think having the right mentorship in place is key.\n\nAlong the way, he discovered a game engine (Microsoft Makecode Arcade) which, while limited, gave him so much to build on - tilemaps, input management, animations, integrated sound/image editor, gravity, etc.  Suddenly, his games could become more complex.  Levels, hidden sections and boss battles were all easily approachable.\n\nFrom my observation, picking up the game engine was easy.  He already loosely knew what needed to happen, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do it in the engine.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say: when you want to learn to code, using a game engine on day one will speed you up, but it may also mean you're skipping some valuable fundamentals.  Perhaps, instead, start smaller and explore. Learn the fundamentals and build on it until you naturally are hitting the limits and need something more powerful.\n\nMy son also did a writeup on his experience using a game engine - [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/)\n\n(Disclosure -  Parents provided multiple rounds of feedback to ensure clarity and coherence of his writeup)",

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?",

To be honest I see the 1990's programmers more capable and genuine interested than today's and they might have possessed greater abilities . It's because most of the operating systems and programming languages were made that are currently used were made at that time for example linux operating systems and popular programming languages like python and C and many more.\n \nMAIN QUESTION:\n\nHow does the programming was learnt back in 1990's , what were the resources used by them maybe manuals or documentations and how would you have learnt programming in 1990's?\n\nMORE CONTEXT:\n To be honest I just want to learn like in self taught way . The main reason being lots of resources being oversaturated in internet and tutorials . So want to become self reliant and understand and apply and build stuff to deeper level.",

So for me things like logic tables and lookup tables and circuits are quite intuitive now while I still struggle heavily to understand object oriented programming. Assembly is a pain in the ass at the beginning but the structure is nice as it is quite simple in its concepts. Being able to do a lot with less like addition and multiplication is fun.\n\nMy programming setup usually starts (whatever \"language\" or similar things like LaTeX) with a text editor and two to three terminals open. One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. \n\nBut understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next. I still have huge issues with VS code because usually the problems I get are related to git or access privileges in the background. If Mac OS was not a full blown Unix I would have been lost at work. And yes, I still write some \"code\" with pen and paper and optimize things by hand from time to time. ",

Not everything we work on goes to master — some modules can’t be shown in production yet, so they remain in development.\n\nPreviously, I refactored a large existing system from a single repo to a **multi-repo setup**: one repository per module (`auth`, `event`, `cms`, etc.) plus a shared components library published to npm. Each project is deployed on its own subdomain.\n\nThat setup has worked quite well overall, but it has its pros and cons:\n\n* PRs don’t interfere with each other, so I can push some changes to production without affecting other projects.\n* The shared library isn’t a problem since it doesn’t get updated often.\n* There’s some repetitive code like interfaces, hooks, and constants.\n* When the shared library does change, I have to manually bump and update the version in every repo (`event`, `auth`, etc.) to avoid version mismatches — a bit annoying.\n* Each repo has its own CI/CD pipeline; it’s repetitive but helps ensure that if one build fails, the others still deploy fine.\n\n# For this new project, I’m considering a monorepo:\n\n    apps/\n      base/\n      community/\n      registration/\n      store/\n    packages/\n      ui/\n      hooks/\n      interfaces/\n      utils/\n\nEverything in one workspace (using Bun/Turborepo)\n\n**My main doubts are:**\n\n* My intention is to use a monorepo, but my main questions are:\n* If only one app or a single change is ready for production, how is that usually managed in a shared repository?\n* How do you handle CI/CD for multiple apps and the shared core (packages like hooks, ui, etc.)?\n* Would you recommend a monorepo or a multi-repo setup with a shared npm package?\n\n# Stack\n\n* Next.js 15 (app router)\n* TypeScript\n* React Query / GraphQL / API Rest\n* Bun / Turborepo\n* CI/CD with Azure Pipelines",

Basically, there's an \"Events\" section which features a bunch of links to Current and Past Events that the club has hosted and clicking on any of them takes you to a dedicated event page. All of the event pages have more or less the same structure. \n\nI can't imagine having to create pages for each of them manually and then route them all to individual endpoints; it sounds very backwards. I mean, there's no way the guys at Youtube are hand-crafting pages for each of it's videos on the database and then manually connecting a million routes. So what's the solution here?\n\nI heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?\n\nAlso, what to do if I wanted to add some unique flair to some of the event pages (but not all) while still maintaining most of the structure? (Say for example, one event page has a different background colour than the rest, or has a few divs here and there that the others don't have)   \nWould I be able to customise without having to break out of the system?",

No other tech stacks regardless of what the project is. Example of when this irked me a little, this last week I had to implement AI into one of the projects to read and automate docs. I wanted to use OCR, and felt like having a simple fastAPI server would've been beneficial as there are many great python packages to handle exactly what I needed but I was told to do so with react, of which packages to handle pdfs were hard to come by and many didn't support OCR from pdfs on react. It would also be nice to use other stacks and see where they benefit.\n\nI have tried other companies but I don't have a degree and every response I get is that I either need a degree or a few years of professional experience and I honestly don't believe that I'm getting that kind of experience with my internship",

I built out classes for each of these three things, and I want to make rule classes that will take in people, times, and work assignments, and generate the lower level elements to plug into the solver engine.\n\nI've done all that and it works, but I'm running into big picture questions:\n\nIf I have a bunch of existing rules, people, times, work assignments, and I change/delete a person, then how do I ensure consistency in the rules that may reference that deleted person?\n\nShould rules contain value or reference links to the people/times/work assignments? Currently I used references (I understand these are pointers under the hood), but all of the reference links made it very hard for me to achieve the next step, which is saving the rules and everything to a file. I think I need to change the references to a key value that can be used to look up the person or whatever, like a GUID or other such key strategy.\n\nIs there any name for this or more complex programming in general that I can google to learn more about what I'm doing? I'm finding I'm building complex data structures but I don't really know what I'm doing, and it's a bit beyond a simple TODO app.",

I think most bonafide engineers aren't super worried or impressed by the prior, but leadership is the one laying people off and changing internal gears.\n\nThen of course there is internal politics, general tech ego, and that entire game which has lead to not-uncommon internal blaming and resultant layoffs with someone having to take the heat.\n\nI feel bad for the 2019+ bootcamp grads that spent 5k+ on a camp to enter entry level.

I was laid off about a year ago and was super happy to find my current role as a software dev engineer about 4 months ago. My background is mostly backend web applications with some front end work (10%) Upon arrival I found out that I'll be part of a devops team which was not a huge issue for me, I've built CICD pipelines in the past and know the basics of what might be required.\n\nAnyway, about 2 months ago I got handed this high visibility project. Basically it is a massive application monorepo and I'm in charge of the pipeline for this project. I've have been struggling to get any support from the team that manages the application. And the person who has become my \"main contact\" is constantly out of office and I'm starting to notice that the delivery target for this pipeline will get delayed. Whenever I bring up any issues to my manager he immediately dismisses my concerns and his rebuttal is \"oh that's not an issue we can resolve it by xyz\" without actually understanding the concern I'm trying to raise. I suppose I could do a better job of not \"accepting\" his answer and trying to make my point clearer but anyway we are kinda past that.\n\nThe other problem is that I've become a defacto project manager. My manager has told me to assign work to other team members and I've had to create a \"second standup\" outside of my main teams standup where we go over the tickets related to this project. My manager has set an aggressive timeline to deliver this project but I'm seeing that we will not be able to deliver it on his timeline and now I'm getting yelled at for delays. I wasn't really expecting to become a project manager for this role, I don't know how to go about dealing my manager who told me in a 1:1 that he would \"rather die than deliver this project late\"\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. On the one hand I'm thinking I can use this opportunity to learn about project management etc however I've started doing the \"project manager\" role really close to the deadline so now I'm getting people up to speed etc while we are expecting to go into production asap. But on the other I'm feeling quite overwhelmed and feeling like this was not my expectations for this role.\n\nThanks for any advice in advance!!",

I’ve been sending out my resume all over the place but I’m struggling to get a lot of bites.\n\nI’m a back-end engineer who specializes in C#, .Net and some SQL, however I’m finding that a lot of the companies I’ve been applying for demand full-stack, but the problem is that I have very little UX experience. I had been meaning to get more into that while I was on my job, but I was never really given an opportunity to learn.\n\nI started a React course a couple of months ago but I’m having a difficult time maintaining my interest in it. I’m almost considering abandoning my job search and just focusing on the course just to get it done, but even then I’ll still have fairly minimal experience with React.\n\nThe best results I’ve had so far have been individuals from recruiting companies pinging me on LinkedIn. Most of the time this results in me sending a resume to them for a contract job. I’ve had a few seem really promising but then ghost me after I get the resume. \n\nThis last week I got in touch with a contractor who was looking for a position that just so happened to be with my first team at the tech company. They fast-tracked me into an interview that ran for far longer than it should have, and actually ran over what was supposed to be a second interview. The recruiter told me they would reschedule the second interview but I haven’t heard back from them. The team wants to have someone in the role by the end of this week but now I fear that even they might not be willing to take me back, even though they have my receipts, are probably using my code, and should know what I’m capable of.\n\nAny advice? I really don’t want to have to get a masters degree or change careers if I can help it.",

        "content": "So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my \"potential\" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. \n\nMy manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).\n\n\"You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler.\" I never was.\n\n\"You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before\"\n\n\"You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.\"\n\n\"You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest\"\n\nAmongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?\n\nAnother annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said \"we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?\". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.\n\nBut the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? \"We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.\"\n\nSo what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.\n\nOr, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.\n\nI have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to share this somewhere where people might understand.",

After being a full time software dev for a fortune 500 company (not big tech) and making a little shy of 100k (65k take home) i have been struggling with personal finances. My mortgage and housing expenses is 40% of my budget, food is 20%, that doesn't leave much to even get ahead. I have a small 3 bed 1 bath in a poor neighborhood and I'm looking to move for a better school district and my budget is aimed at the worst houses in the market. My wife is disabled and a stay at home mom so I only have 1 income and I'm dealing with health issues myself that makes me not on top of my game.\n\nI studied hard 8 months last year for big tech jobs but when I went to apply I put in apps to all big tech companies I only got Amazon responding and I failed their initial screening due to it being a design problem rather than leetcode. Even tried applying to jobs that weren't big tech and don't get a call back.\n\nI could do a business or at least a micro saas for income but I have too much idea paralysis before starting. I could make anything with software and I make great  full stack software but I don't have a GREAT idea for an undeserved market. \n\nI could specialize in a field in CS but I am a .NET/go dev with some full stack experience. I could go to a different field like cyber sec or data engineering but I don't know a good list of ones that pay more than software development. \n\nI am regarded as an up and comer in my organization and work well and hard, but I am underutilized and underpaid. They also don't have a lot of promotion cycles so I don't feel I'm getting promoted as quick as my skills. I should hit senior level within a year or so.\n\nTLDR\nJust feeling lost at the moment. I feel starting a business is the only way to get uncapped salary but get stuck with idea paralysis and undeserved markets. I studied hard at a good university and graduated magna cum laude but I just feel stuck like I learned all that for nothing. Not utilizing enough of my skills at work and not getting paid enough and no calls back from jobs. With 60% of my pay going to a small house and food (not to mention medical bills) its tough to get ahead. ",

Career choices, life choices, and all this affects the people around me.\n\nI'm a decent engineer. I've built stuff, I've solved problems. I know my FE shit.\n\nSince end of August I've participated in several processes, both startups and non startups. I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).\n\nI recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.\n\nHere is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.\n\n24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like \"we wanted to see how you would approach the problem\" and \"we didnt see the depth we were looking for\". (honestly I dont buy it)\n\nI accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the \"AI Bubble\" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?\n\nThe other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.\n\nNeedless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \\_very\\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.\n\nI have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.\n\nThe other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.\n\nDuring live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.\n\nRejected",

My manager and my colleagues like me, and my manager is promising a promo in 1-2 years (i know this can be bs), seems like most junior engineers get promoted pretty fast. WLB is ok too.\n\nI chatted with my friends, and it seems like they are all not getting much learning in their job, and it sounds like dealing with a hot mess is a norm in this industry, doesn't that defeat my original purpose for job switching?

I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).\n\nThe company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.\n\nYet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?\n\nI’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.\n\nSo I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences. ",

I completely dropped applying for jobs ever since I got this current position because it genuinely just made me depressed every day, but with full time right around the corner and finding out full time genuinely is just worse in this pay with barely any pay bumps, I want to start looking for better software engineering positions out there. So here's my question: how do I start again?\n\n  \nHere's where I am at right now. I already rebuilt my resume, updated my LinkedIn and GitHub to match my current experience, and I have a personal website I already included on my resume and attach on any application. My previous internship had be working on Backend JavaScript most of the time, and my current place utilizes php, python, and CRM development whenever I'm doing programming stuff. I really prefer C# and JavaScript. Admittedly I have not worked on a personal project in a long time, but I intend to work on some C# related projects soon. Where should I be looking for positions? Is it still LinkedIn, or is there a better option? Are there any programming languages that are high in demand right now that I should focus on instead? Should I use a different version of my resume each time I apply for anywhere? I've been out of the game for a while, and I know it's only gotten worse. I'm wondering what my next step should be now that I at least have something worth a damn to put on a resume, or if I should just abandon ship and use my experience for something adjacent.

My mistakes are weighed more than my accomplishments (eg a 'mistake' weighted would be  for merging a branch without the best optimal solution or sometimes missing a small detail  despite my co workers approving the PR)  . I love my co-workers, I dont slack. I get along with them and pair program with them  often.  I eventually got a PIP and desptie going beyond expectations. I dont think Ill make it as it got extended.  I survived many layoffs here, but I guess this is how I go.\n\nI think the positive of PIP is that it pushes you to be aware of your flaws and focus on perfecitonism, but at the same time its  burning me out lol and perfectionism is not sustainable as we are all humans. We all mistakes. Maybe its stockholm syndrome at this point.",

        "content": "\nGood day devs! \n\nI’ve been working as a junior software dev (2 YOE) for a couple months now. It’s just me and my boss.  He’s an ex-Reddit engineer with ~15 years of experience, and I come from a web background.\n\nWe’re building a pretty big multi-app Flutter + Firebase project using Clean Architecture, which is all new to me. The main struggle I’m having is that I rarely get clear requirements. Usually I’ll get something like:\n\n“We need a chat box that can also record audio.”\n\nAnd that’s it. From there, I’m expected to figure out everything — UX, architecture, edge cases, and make it up to his standards.\n\nHe doesn’t really walk me through the context or help clarify requirements; I usually just get feedback once I open my first PR. My PRs almost never meet expectations on the first few goes, and sometimes I make rookie mistakes (like forgetting to rebase), which makes me feel even worse. His feedback can be pretty blunt, too.\n\nBecause I’m still learning Flutter, Firebase, and the project structure, things take me a long time — sometimes weeks for a single feature. Even when I do understand the requirements, like for the Auth flow I’m finishing now, it’s still slow progress.\n\nI’m trying hard to improve, but it’s been rough. During my interview, I said I perform above the average junior — and he’s holding me to that, which is fair. But right now I feel like I’m constantly falling short, and I can’t tell if that’s because I’m actually underperforming… or because this setup would be tough for anyone at my level.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\nIs this kind of setup (basically no guidance, just tasks and expectations) normal for a junior? am I genuinely underperforming? And if you’ve been in a similar spot, what helped you get through it?\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nI’m a 2 YOE junior dev working under a super-senior ex-Reddit engineer. I get very vague task descriptions (e.g. “build a chat box that records audio”) and have to figure everything out myself — UX, architecture, edge cases, etc. I’m learning a new stack (Flutter + Firebase + Clean Arch), so progress is slow and feedback is tough. Not sure if I’m actually underperforming or if this setup is just rough for a junior. Looking for advice or perspective.\n",

        "content": "SDE2 of 7 YoE. I've been reorg'd to my current team 1.5 years ago, and it's been a nightmare. I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. \n\nI've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:\n\n1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.\n2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.\n3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.\n4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.\n5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job.\n\n  \nI'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.\n\nAm I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",

I will be spending an evening with them so are there specific things I should watch out for or remember?\n\n  \nUpdate: Thanks everyone for the help! The best advice was just asking them because I found out that the admin person organizing everything screwed up some details. The only thing I'm even responsible for is flight and apparently they take care of everything else.

I’m receiving psychological and psychiatric treatment, but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. I just feel exhausted.\n\nIf I continue in my current program, it would probably take me about 2.5 more years if everything goes perfectly, which honestly seems unlikely.\nIf I switch universities, I would likely have to start almost from scratch (3.5 more years).\nAnd if I quit completely, I’m afraid of being directionless and feeling even more stuck.\n\nWhat worries me the most is the future:\nI want to work in technology, grow into leadership or managerial roles, and eventually emigrate. But I don’t know if I absolutely need a university degree for that, or if I could build that path through technical certifications and work experience.

Got an offer from a pretty cool AI startup, remote first global company. \n\nSome context: at Amazon I’m on an important team, starting to think about promotion, but manager recently moved so that’s been delayed and harder without him. Probably 6-12 months to L5 (what my L6 said) and salary goes up around 20%. Working 10-6, sometimes 7. Pretty chill wlb and good team. Not many perks. Lots of responsibilities and big projects with large impact.\n\nI definitely have a short term life goal of moving away from London for a few years while I am young. in a year after my promo I can move to the US on L1 visa, idk how feasible it is to get a good transfer internationally tho.\n\nGot an offer from a pretty big startup, it’s remote first but has offices in a few places, spoke to some engineers and they are working 9-7 so about 2 more per day. Salary around 30% more than Zon, take home post tax is 5.1k, vs 4k atm. Even after promo I’ll be only be on about 4.5k. It’s an exciting AI company, very interesting fast paced work.\n\nSo here’s the decision-making part… I’d make more, moving now, than I would even after a promo here. At the startup, we would report to a tech lead who reports to the CTO; it’s fast-paced and high ownership (so is Amazon, tbf). I think I’ll have a lot of responsibilities, not treated like an L4, and I think it will supercharge my growth.\n\nMy main concerns: is being a digital nomad at 22 weird? Idk how I feel about it for career growth, but I love travelling, so I’d be excited! But I might be more excited about the USA move (even though it’s two years away, I’d be 24). I’m not sure how easy it is, and I’m not sure if I’d have the same opportunity to move if I was in the startup.\n\nWhat would you guys do? Idk. Anything I’m not considering? The way I’m thinking about is - I’m 22, most of my peers are still unemployed and I am in a very fortunate position. Unsure if I’m rushing into a job switch too fast.",

I have over 3 years of experience and I’ve applied to over 2000 jobs across IT. I did manage to get a part-time Data Engineer position but that work is kinda ending soon due to budget issues and I don’t have anything lined up yet.\n\nI’ve been getting a few interviews here and there even 5-6 for single role but nothing has worked out so far. I feel completely drained and I’m constantly worrying about losing my status and the student loan which I can’t afford to clear if I leave to my home country though I have been getting offers there. \n\nI’m at a point where I don’t know what to do next and I am so exhausted atp just survive here until I can land something just even to clear my loan. \n\nIf you could provide me any suggestions or leads, I’d be very grateful.\n\nI just needed to let this out :(((",

I did not get the offer unfortunately, and was told I am not senior level, despite answering all technical questions correctly and naturally, and having a history of leading projects and mentoring new hires. I also have high profile references.\n\nI know the job market is super competitive, so maybe that was just their only critique as they decided to choose someone else.\n\nI have 2 interviews today for senior level roles. Anyone have tips for making sure I seem worthy of that title? They are hybrid, and I definitely have some leverage because of that. Not many people want to move or return to office.\n\nTLDR: Senior level skills, didn’t get official title before company restructure.

I will admit I had an easy time in tech as I started in a golden period. He gets basically his salary cut again if he doesn't meet the patient quota number. He ends up spending so many more hours per workday charting (AI note taking is not allowed) and doing the other work because the other physicians dump the difficult patients onto him as they have seniority. He has a clinic prior but running it was difficult, and he was making even less money while assuming so much more risk.  What advice would you give to my friend who is a medical doctor who is jaded by private equity and partners squeezing so much out of healthcare. He apparently makes less than many nurses because he refuses to give into the quotas and push patients out ASAP. He also wants to be able to work from home and be with family more as he has given up so much family time being as physician. ",

        "content": "Background: I have a little over 1 YOE, working at a defense company since I graduated college. I live in an MCOL area, and my base pay is \\~90K. I am expecting a promotion soon (from L1 to L2) which I believe will get me to 110-130K. I am in person full time because my work requires a clearance, which is kind of sucky (I would prefer a hybrid/remote role).\n\nI want to leave my role for a few reasons:\n\n* Salary increase\n* Potentially switch to another company with more prestige\n* Remote/hybrid opportunities\n* The tech stack I'm working with is fairly modern, but I do feel like the project suffers from poor software engineering practices. It lacks structure, has inconsistent code quality, minimal error handling, and an unresponsive, buggy UI. It feels like it was built without clear architecture or professional standards. The codebase is massive, so theres only so much I can do about this.\n\nThe problem is that although I want to leave, the current state of the market is really rough and I am considering staying due to the job stability that I have. I am wondering if I should just stick it out with my current company for several more years and get a master's degree while I work full time, which the company will pay for in its entirety. At my company, getting a master's degree leads to a promotion quicker from L2 to L3, and I am thinking if I get a master's degree, especially in the AI/ML space, it will help me in the future when it comes to my career and opening up more jobs. However, doing this will keep me stuck at the company for several years and I won't be able to leave until 1 year after I have obtained the degree.  \n  \nGiven the current state of the market, is it a better idea to stick it out with my company and get a master's degree, or stay screw it and apply to other companies?",
