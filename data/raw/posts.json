I am also studying Software Engineering at the moment.\n\nI've been working in isolated environments for the past 3 years which prevents me from using modern cloud platforms. Most of my time in DE has been on the platform side, not the data side. \n\nSince I joined the field, DevOps, MLOPs, LLMs, RAG and Data Lakehouse have been added to our responsibility on top of the old Modern Data Stack and Data Warehouses. This stack covers all of the use cases I have faced so far. \n\nThese are my current recommendations for each of those problems in a self hosted, open source environment (with the exception of vibe coding, I haven't found any model good enough to do so yet). You don't need all of these tools, but you could use them all if you needed to. Solve the problems you have with the minimum tools you can. \n\nI have been working on guides on how to deploy the stack in docker/kubernetes on my site, [www.datacraftsman.com.au](http://www.datacraftsman.com.au), but not all of them are finished yet... I've been vibe coding data engineering tools instead as it's a fun distraction. \n\nI hope these resources help you make a better decision with your architecture.\n\nComment below if you have any advice on improving the stack with reasons why, need any help setting up the tools or want to understand my choices and I'll try my best to help.",

In all I processed 178.33 GB ZIP files, which uncompressed was 3314.57 GB. I created Parquet files for each table, with the data types optimized.\n\nHere are some next steps that I want to do, and I would love anyone's comments on it:\n\n* Create a Dagster (have to learn it) pipeline that downloads and processes the data tables when they are updated (I am almost finished creating a Python Package).\n* Create a process that will upload the files to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERNs data portal) and other sites such as The Internet Archive, and Hugging Face. The data will be versioned so we will always be able to go back in time and see what code was used to create the data and how the data has changed. I also want to create a torrent file for each dataset and have it HTTP seeded from the aforementioned sites; I know this is overkill as the largest dataset is only 6.94 GB, but I want to experiment with it as I think it would be awesome for a data portal to have this feature.\n* Create a Python package that magically links the data tables to their geographic boundaries. This way people will be able to view it software such as QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, DeckGL, lonboard, or anything that can read Parquet.\n\nAll of the code to create the data is currently in \\[2\\]. Like I said, I am creating a Python package \\[3\\] for processing the data tables, but I am also learning as I go on how to properly make a Python package.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.diegoripley.ca/blog/2025/what-i-learned-from-processing-all-statcan-tables/](https://www.diegoripley.ca/blog/2025/what-i-learned-from-processing-all-statcan-tables/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://github.com/dataforcanada/process-statcan-data](https://github.com/dataforcanada/process-statcan-data)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://github.com/diegoripley/stats\\_can\\_data](https://github.com/diegoripley/stats_can_data)\n\n  \nCheers!",

Jupyter notebooks and the whole DS package, to completely and finally document the data pipeline _and the data quality_, before the data analysts can lay their eyes on the data. And at that point it's considered a failure if I need to make some change. \n\nI feel like this is very waterfall like, and slows us down, because they could have gotten the data much faster if I don't have to spend time doing basically what they should be doing either way, and probably will do again. If there was a genuine intentional feedback loop between us, we could move much faster than what were doing. But now it's considered failure if an adjustment is needed or an additional column must be added etc after the pipeline is documented, which must be completed before they will touch the data.\n\nI actually don't mind doing data analysis on a personal level, but it's weird that a data starved data science team doesn't want more data and sooner, and do this analysis themselves?",

I’ve built and maintained a large number of ETL pipelines, written and maintained complex stored procedures, managed SQL Server insurance, Agent jobs, and ssrs reporting, data warehousing environments, etc...\n\nMany of my projects have involved heavy ETL logic, business rule enforcement, and production data troubleshooting. Years ago, I also did a bit of API development in .NET using SOAP, but that’s pretty dated now.\n\nWhat I’m learning now:\nI'm in an ai guided adventure of....\n\nCore Python (I feel like I have a decent understanding after a month dedicated in it)\n\npandas for data cleaning and transformation\n\nFile I/O (Excel, CSV)\n\nWorking with missing data, filtering, sorting, and aggregation\n\n\n\nAbout to start on database connectivity and orchestration using Airflow and API integration with requests (coming up)\n\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts or advice. This subreddit has already been a huge help as I try to modernize my skill set.\n\n--------\nHere’s what I’m wondering:\n\nAm I on the right path? \n\nDo I need to fully adopt modern tools like docker, Airflow, dbt, Spark, or cloud-native platforms to stay competitive? Or is there still a place in the market for someone with a strong SSIS and SQL Server background?  Will companies even look at me with a lack of newer technologies under my belt.\n\nShould I aim for mid-level roles while I build more modern experience, or could I still be a good candidate for senior-level data engineering jobs?\n\nAre there any tools or concepts you’d consider must-haves before I start applying?\n",

Mostly used pandas to prepare datasets. I'll need a refresher on this though.\n* Built a whole backend for a Flutter-based app (also the frontend) using Supabase: designed the schemas, the tables, RLS, Edge Functions, cron jobs (related to the startup I mentionned earlier)\n* Experience with Git\n* Have a really low understanding of container with Docker\n* Currently reading the holy bible that is The fundamentals of Data Engineering\n\n\nWhat I don't have:\n\n* Experience on AWS/Azure/GCP\n* Spark/Hadoop\n* Kafka\n* Airflow\n* DBT/Databricks\n* Didn't do a lot of data pipelines\n* Didn't do a lot of CI/CD\n\nand probably more I'm forgetting.

We have an S3 end-point in the VPC to avoid egress costs.\n\nThat script calls script: `scripts/mount_nvme_aws.sh` which creates a RAID 0 storage array from the local NVMe disks - creating a single volume that has: 11.4TB in storage.\n\nWe launched the GizmoSQL Docker container using `scripts/run_gizmosql_aws.sh` \\- which includes the AWS S3 CLI utilities (so we can copy data, etc.).\n\nWe then copied the S3 data from `s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc/` to the local NVMe RAID 0 array volume - using attached script: `scripts/copy_coiled_data_from_s3.sh` \\- and it used: 2.3TB of the storage space. This copy step took: 11m23.702s (costing $2.78 on-demand, and $0.54 spot).\n\nWe then launched GizmoSQL via the steps after the docker stuff in: `scripts/run_gizmosql_aws.sh` \\- and connected remotely from our laptop via the Arrow Flight SQL JDBC Driver - (see repo: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql) for details) - and ran this SQL to create a view on top of the parquet datasets:\n\n    CREATE VIEW measurements_1trc\n    AS\n    SELECT *\n      FROM read_parquet('data/coiled-datasets-rp/1trc/*.parquet');\n    \n\nRow count:\n\nWe then ran the test query:\n\n    SELECT station, min(measure), max(measure), avg(measure)\n    FROM measurements_1trc\n    GROUP BY station\n    ORDER BY station;\n    \n\nIt took: 0:02:22 (142s) the first execution (cold-start) - at an EC/2 on-demand cost of: $0.56, and a spot cost of: $0.11\n\nIt took: 0:02:09 (129s) the second execution (warm-start) - at an EC/2 on-demand cost of: $0.51, and a spot cost of: $0.10\n\nSee: [https://github.com/coiled/1trc/issues/7](https://github.com/coiled/1trc/issues/7) for scripts, etc.\n\nSide note:  \nQuery: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM measurements_1trc;` takes: 21.8s",

Reporting is mainly done via downloading files from the ERP and importing it into PowerBI or excel. For some projects we call the api of the ERP to get the data. Other specialized Applications sit on Top of the SQL databases.\n\nProblems: Most of the Reports get fed manually and we really want to get them to run automatically (including data cleaning), which would save a lot of time. Also, the many sources of Data cause a lot of confusion, as internal clients are not always sure where the Data comes from and how up to date it is. Combining data sources is also very painful right now and work feels very redundant. This is why i would like to Build a „single source of truth“.\n\nMy idea is to Build a analytics database, most likely a data Warehouse according to kimball. I understand how it works theoretically, but i have never done it. I have a masters in business Informatics (Major in Business Intelligence and System Design) and have read the kimball Book. SQL knowledge is very Basic, but i am very motivated to learn.\n\nMy questions to you are:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠is this a project that i could handle myself without any practical experience? Our IT Department is very small and i only have one colleague that could support a little with database/sql stuff. I know python and have a little experience with prefect. I have no deadline and i can do courses/certs if necessary.\n2.\t⁠⁠My current idea is to start with Open source/free tools. BigQuery, airbyte, dbt and prefect as orchestrator. Is this a feasible stack or would this be too much overhead for the beginning? Bigquery, Airbyte and dbt are new to me, but i am motivated to learn (especially the Latter)\n\nI know that i will have to do a internal Research on wether this is a feasible project or not, also Talking to stakeholders and defining processes. I will do that before developing anything. But i am still wondering if any of you were in a similar situation or if some More experienced DEs have a few hints for me. Thanks :)",

        "title": "Why Realtime Analytics Feels Like a Myth (and What You Can Actually Expect)",
        "author": "ivanimus",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\n\nHi there 👋\n\nI’ve been diving into the concept of realtime analytics, and I’m starting to think it’s more hype than reality. Here’s why achieving true realtime analytics (sub-second latency) is so tough, especially when building data marts in a Data Warehouse or Lakehouse:\n\n1. Processing Delays: Even with CDC (Change Data Capture) for instant raw data ingestion, subsequent steps like data cleaning, quality checks, transformations, and building data marts take time. Aggregations, validations, and metric calculations can add seconds to minutes, which is far from the \"realtime\" promise (<1s).\n\n2. Complex Transformations: Data marts often require heavy operations—joins, aggregations, and metric computations. These depend on data volume, architecture, and compute power. Even with optimized engines like Spark or Trino, latency creeps in, especially with large datasets.\n\n3. Data Quality Overhead: Raw data is rarely clean. Validation, deduplication, and enrichment add more delays, making \"near-realtime\" (seconds to minutes) the best-case scenario.\n\n4. Infra Bottlenecks: Fast ingestion via CDC is great, but network bandwidth, storage performance, or processing engine limitations can slow things down.\n\n5. Hype vs. Reality: Marketing loves to sell \"realtime analytics\" as instant insights, but real-world setups often mean seconds-to-minutes latency. True realtime is only feasible for simple use cases, like basic metric monitoring with streaming systems (e.g., Kafka + Flink).\n\nTL;DR: Realtime analytics isn’t exactly a scam, but it’s overhyped. You’re more likely to get \"near-realtime\" due to unavoidable processing and transformation delays. To get close to realtime, simplify transformations, optimize infra, and use streaming tech—but sub-second latency is still a stretch for complex data marts.\n\nWhat’s your experience with realtime analytics? Have you found ways to make it work, or is near-realtime good enough for most use cases? ",

        "content": "Anyone else ever built a data pipeline that started simple but somehow became more complex than the problem it was supposed to solve?\n\nBecause that's exactly what happened to us with our Snowflake setup. What started as a straightforward streaming pipeline turned into: procedures dynamically generating SQL merge statements, tasks chained together with dependencies, custom parallel processing logic because the sequential stuff was too slow...\n\nSo we decided to give Dynamic Tables a try.\n\n**What changed:** Instead of maintaining all those procedures and task dependencies, we now have simple table definitions that handle deduplication, incremental processing, and scheduling automatically. One definition replaced what used to be multiple procedures and merge statements.\n\n**The reality check:** It's not perfect. We lost detailed logging capabilities (which were actually pretty useful for debugging), there are SQL transformation limitations, and sometimes you miss having that granular control over exactly what's happening when.\n\nFor our use case, I think it’s a better option than the pipeline, which grew and grew with additional cases that appeared along the way.\n\n**Anyone else made similar trade-offs?** Did you simplify and lose some functionality, or did you double down and try to make the complex stuff work better?\n\nAlso curious - anyone else using Dynamic Tables vs traditional Snowflake pipelines?

Adjusting the drop-off to be less frequent won’t work because the business wants the data up-to-date.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar scenario and found an approach they liked?

In reality, they’re just paying for an expensive Microsoft license to make alterations to a cloud-based semantic model that really just abstracts the data of their source system. My position is that it seems like an anti-pattern to expect your OLAP environment to influence your OLTP environment rather than the other way around. Someone else suggested changing the CRM system and got very little upvotes. \n\nI think data engineering is still going to be lucrative in 10 years because businesses will need people to unfuck everything when Microsoft is bleeding  them dry after selling them all these point and click “solutions” that aren’t scalable and locks them into their Microsoft licensing. There’s going to be an inflection point where it just makes more economic sense to set up a Postgres database and an API and make reports with a python-based visualization library. ",

Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style.  The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.\n\nThat being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query.

Everything is on-prem and the tools we're provided are Python, MS SQL Server, Power BI and the ability to ask IT to set up a shared drive.\n\nThe data flow I'm dealing with is a small-ish amount of data that's made up of reports from various outside organizations that have to be cleaned/transformed and then reformed into an overall report.\n\nI'm looking at something like a Medallion-like architecture where I have bronze (raw data), silver (cleaning/transforming) and gold (data warehouse connected to powerbi) layers that are set up as different schemas in SQL Server. Also, should the bronze layer just be a shared drive in this case or do we see a benefit in adding it to the RDBMS?  \n  \nSo I'm basically just asking for a gut check here to see if this makes sense or if something like Delta Lake would be necessary here. In addition, I've traditionally used schemas to separate dev from uat and prod in the RDBMS. But if I'm then also separating it by  medallion layers then we start to get what seems to be some unnecessary schema bloat. \n\nAnyway, thoughts on this? ",

The sad part of it was that DE role had absolutely no work in the start-up idk why they even hired me but i salvaged what i could, I built basic stacks from scratch(combo of managed and serverless services), set up CDC, Data Lake-ish architecture(not how clean as i had hoped it to be) all while the data being extremely minimal like MBs, I solely did it just to learn because the CEO did not seem to care about anything at all. I'm pretty sure the lay-off was because they realised if they don't have the product or the data or the money to pay me so why need a DE at all (honestly why keep the company at all). I might have fumbled a lil and i should have switched sooner but the problem still stands that I have no prod or any real DE experience. I experiement with services all the time, anything opensource(basics using docker) like kafka, airflow and I have a strong handle of AWS I would like to believe. Now that I am here -- unemployed, idk what to do, I must clarify that i do tech for money and my passions do lie elsewhere. But I don't hate it or anything and I really like the money. I just don't know how to get back into the DE market, like yk where there a lil bit of senior DE team that wouldn't mind hiring me just because (I am willing to learnn). I actually gave freelance DE a thought too. Like I have AWS certifications and stuff, how about breaking into freelance consulting? anyways, I would love to know what you would do in a situation like this.\n\nPS: Please be kind for my mental health purposes thanks.\n\n",

How valid is their point? Do we even need a data warehouse (or lakehouse and all those fancy things I don't know anything about)?\n\nOne argument they had was that BI tools come with their own specialized \"database\" that is optimized and much faster in a way we could never build it manually.\n\nBut do they really? I know Excel/power query has some sort of storage, same with powerBI but that's not a database, right?\n\nI'm just a bit at a loss here and was hoping you actual engineers could steer me in the right direction.\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n",

(this course is with a third party [not a vendor] that I won't name).\n\nAll of my courses have sandbox environments that can be run in GitHub CodeSpaces, infra is open source, and uses a public gov dataset. For this I'm planning on having the following:\n- Postgres Database\n- pgAdmin for SQL IDE\n- A very simple typescript frontend app to surface data\n- A very simple user login workflow for CRUD data\n- A data catalog via DataHub\n\nWe will have a working data product as well as create data by going through the login workflow a couple times. We will then intentionally break it (update the data to be bad, change the login data collected without changing schema, and changing the DDL files to introduce errors). These errors will be hidden from the user, but they will see a bunch of errors in the logs and frontend.\n\nFrom there we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the issues. Examples of ways we will resolve issues is the following:\n- Revert back changes to the frontend\n- Add regex validation for login workflow\n- Review and fix introduced bugs in the DDL files\n- Implement DQ checks to run in CI/CD that compares proposed schema changes to expected schema in data catalog\n\nAnything you would add or change to this plan? Note that I already have a DQ for analytical databases course that this builds on.\n\nMy goal is less teaching theory, and more so creating a real-world experience that matches what the job is actually like.",

        "author": "paulrpg",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm doing some design work where are are generally trying to follow Kimball modelling for a star schema. I'm familiar with the theory of the data warehouse toolkit but I haven't had that much experience implementing it. For reference, we are doing this in snowflake/dbt and were talking about tables with a few million rows.\n\nI am trying to model a process which has a fixed hierarchy. We have 3 layers to this - a top level organisational plan, a plan for doing a functional test and then the individual steps taken to complete this plan. To make it a bit more complicated - whilst the process I am looking at has a fixed hierarchy but the process is a subset of a larger process which allows for arbitrary depth, I feel that the simpler business case is easier to solve first.\n\nI want to end up with 1 or several dimensional models to capture this, store descriptive text etc. The literature states that fixed hierarchies should be flattened. If we took this approach:\n\n* Our dimension table grain is 1 row for each task\n* Each row would contain full textual information for the functional test and the organisational plan\n* We have a small 'One Big Table' approach, making it easy for BI users to access the data\n\nThe challenge I see here is around what keys to use. Our business processes map to different levels of this hierarchy, some to the top level plan, some to the functional test and some to the step.\n\nI keep going back and forth as a more normalised approach - where 1 table for each of these steps and then build a bridge table to map them all together is something that we have done for arbitrary depth and it worked really well.\n\nIf we are to go with a flattened model then:\n\n* Should I include the surrogate keys for each level in the hierarchy (preferred) or model the relationship in a secondary table?\n* Business analysts are going to use this - is this their preferred approach - they will have fewer joins to do but will need to do more aggregation/deduplication if they are only interested in top level information\n\nIf we go for a more normalised model:\n\n* Should we be offering a pre-joined view of the data - effectively making a 'one big table' available at the cost of performance?",

        "content": "Hi everyone...I am here just to ask guy few things, I hope you guys will help resolve some of the doubts that I have. \n\nSo I have been working as SQL Server Dba for last 2 years for a service based company and I am currently part of the dba team which caters to atleast 8-10 clients simultaneously. Most of my work is monitoring work with ocassional high level stuff, otherwise most of the time I get like L1 level tasks. Since we cater to multiple clients therefore I had the opportunity to get in touch with other databases like MySQL and Oracle. I also work in AWS cloud, mainly we work with RDS, S3 for backups and EC2 instances where DB instances are installed. We work in rotational shifts which is the least favorite part of the job me. \n\nI got DBA role as a chance to enter to corporate and specially the data field, but I really don't like the DBA role, because I have seen the kind of time this role demands from you. I have seen my manager even working weekends sometimes due to some client activity or doing some POC for potential client. Plus the rotational shift I just hate it, I have endured for 2 years but I don't think so I will be able to endure for another year or two. \n\nI have been working remotely for last 2 years Therefore I had plenty of time to upskill myself and learn technologies like SQL Server, AWS Cloud (Mainly Database related tasks), L1 administration of MySQL and Oracle. Apart from that I have also invested time in learning Python which I like a lot, I had also invested a lot time in learning SQL too. Earlier I was learning web dev along job thinking that I could transition from DBA to dev, but I realised that both are very different roles and whatever I have learnt here as a DBA won't do me that good in dev role. Therefor I have decided to further transition into DE role. \n\nI have made a plan of the things that I will have to learn for DE role and also a plan to double down on things I already know. Mostly I want to focus on Azure ecosystem for DE and for That I have decided to learn SQL, Azure Data Factory - ADF - ETL, Databricks, Python, Spark - PySpark, Azure Synapse Analytics. I am already familiar with SQL and Python as mentioned before, and just need to take care of the other things. \n\nI just want to know from you guys is this even possible? Or am I just stuck with DBA role forever? Is my plan even relevant and doable or not? \n\nI have come to hate rotational shift and specially the night shifts so much that made my hate for DBA role even more greater. I am just looking for opinions, what do you guys think?\n\nAzure Devops",

        "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nNeed some advice on below process. Wanted to know if anybody has encountered this weird behaviour snowflake.\n\nScenario 1 :- The Kafka Stream\n\nwe have a kafka stream running on a snowflake permanent table, which runs a put command to upload the csv files to table stage and then runs a copy command which unloads the data into the table. And then a RM command to remove the files from table stage.\n\norder of execution :- PUT to table\\_1 stage >> copy to table\\_1 >> RM to remove table\\_1 stage file.\n\nAll the above mentioned steps are handled by kafka of course :)\n\nAnd as expected this runs fine, no rows missed during the process.\n\n  \nScenario 2:- The batch load\n\nSometimes we need to do i batch load onto the same table, just in case of the kafka stream failure.\n\nwe have a custom application to select and send out the batch file for loading. But below is the over all process via our custom application.\n\nPut file to snowflake named stage >> copy command to unload the file to table\\_1.\n\nNote :- in our scenario we want to load batch data into the same table where the kafka stream is running.  \n\n\nThis batch load process only works fine when the kafka stream is turned off on the table. All the rows from the files gets loaded fine.\n\nBut here is the catch, once the kafka stream is turned on the table, if we try to load the batch file it doesnt just load at all.\n\nI have checked the query history and copy history.And found out another weird behaviour. It says the copy command has been run successfully and loaded around 1800 records into the table. But the file that we had uploaded had 57k. Even though it says it had loaded 1800 rows, those rows are nowhere to be found in the table.\n\n  \nHas anyone encountered this issue? I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal. But i dont understand this behaviour of snowflake. Couldn't find anything on the documentation either.",

The goal is to ingest the data into snowflake from various sources. \n\nFor this first pipeline here is a simplified process:   \n1. File is uploaded in SharePoint Folder to be ingested  \n2. File is picked up and split into csv's based on sheet names (Using Python presumably)\n3. Those CSVs are then uploaded into Snowflake Tables\n4. Once in Snowflake I will trigger tasks that transform and get the data where we want it (This I've already mostly figured out). \n\nWe have been leaning towards Azure Data Factory for our data pipelines as the basics are already set up but I seem to be having issues figuring out a reliable source for running python in ADF. I have seen stuff from Azure Functions and Batch Processing (which I have little experience configuring and setting up). Another solution would be to just migrate to a full python approach with Apache Airflow but that would be another system to configure... \n\nI would love assistance on how people use ADF and Python or if I should be thinking in a different way for these pipelines.

I don't know if my issue is me doing something wrong, or just a limitation with redash.\n\nThere are two ways redash lets you build a sankey diagram. One is to have columns for each of the 5 stages it allows, and a value at the end, like so\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yab0ef01z9bf1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de2d91924dd3134d7c528d019f158ca82dcb166\n\nbut this makes it hard to add, say, another link from d to f, or from b to g, without also considering the previous stages. This seems to just take the sum of the rows to determine the previous ones.\n\nThe other way is to just have a source, target, and value column, which seems a bit more common in other tools too. This looks like so:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akvztapaz9bf1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=cccce7ebcf2c344312babe223d4d2d71603d5dbf\n\nand this works.

However, if I add a row linking b to c, then c is a target for both a and b, and that links up right.\n\nI guess I'm asking, given this data:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30e4tlaey9bf1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb2c55cf59c5606bd41c323796a02a0375847cf\n\nIs there any way to get this to link up correctly, without it duplicating b?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1fzw3jiy9bf1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb565fde517c28a4b9511d04c54360fc7574ad1",

Our core stack includes MinIO, Apache Spark, probably Trino, some Scheduler for backend/compute as well as Jupyter + some web based SQL UI as front ends.\n\nHere’s where I’m hitting a roadblock: table management, especially as we scale. We're expecting a ton of Delta tables, and I'm unsure how best to track where each table lives and whether it's in Hive, Delta, or Iceberg format.\n\nI was thinking of introducing Hive Metastore (HMS) as a central point of truth for all table definitions, so both analysts and data engineers can rely on it when interacting with Spark. But honestly, the HMS documentation feels pretty thin, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something—or maybe even looking at the wrong solution altogether.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n- How do you manage table definitions and data location metadata in your stack?\n- If you’re using Hive Metastore, how do you handle IAM and access control?\n\nWould really appreciate your insights or battle-tested setups!\n",

Now that I’ve entered my third year, I’ve decided to aim for a Java Full Stack Developer role. I know it’s a heavy-duty role, but I want to keep it as my goal even if I don't fully achieve it, at least I’ll be moving in a clear direction.\n\nHere’s the issue I’ve been facing: whenever I watch a YouTube video of someone building an end-to-end project, I expect to learn something valuable. But then I see that the actual learning requires following a long playlist. Theoretically, the concepts make sense I understand the data flow and architecture. But when I get to the implementation, especially the backend, everything becomes overwhelming.\n\nThere are all these annotations, unfamiliar syntax, and configurations that feel like they just magically work and I have no clue why or how. I end up copying the code just to make it work, but in the end, I realize I’ve understood very little. It feels more like rote copying than actual learning.\n\nTruthfully, I feel lost during this process. The complexity of the syntax and the lack of clarity around what’s happening behind the scenes demotivates me.\n\nSo, here’s what I really want to understand: how do people actually “learn” a tech stack or anything new in tech?\n\nDo they just copy someone else's project (like I’m doing) and somehow that’s enough to add it to their resume? I’ve watched so many roadmaps that I know the general advice—pick a language, choose a framework, build projects—but when it comes to actual implementation, I feel like without that tutorial in front of me, I wouldn’t be able to write a single line of meaningful logic on my own.\n\nIs this really how someone LEARNS in a IT Tech Industry?\n\nJust by watching playlist and rote copying?\n",

Whenever I decide to code, I don't even last 10 minutes. I burn out, cry, get back again, and again burn out. I am unable to apply all the knowledge I acquired to build a mere quiz game.

        "author": "cheyyne",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.\n\nThe actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.\n\nThe game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.\n\nAnd that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.\n\nA large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate \"Smart Supply\" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.\n\nAnyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*\n\nSo I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.\n\n**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.\n\nAnyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun! Happy coding!",

        "author": "W_lFF",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I was also guilty of this when I started 3 years ago. I wanted to learn everything, because everything seemed so cool. My main goal was Backend development but I ended up starting courses on Kotlin, Go, Rust, Java, Python and Lua. I didn't see these languages as tools but as personalities, and that's a big mistake I made aswell as a lot of other beginners. Very often I'd find myself asking questions like \"How many languages should I learn?\", \"Is Java, JavaScript and Python a good stack for backend development?\", but I'd still be learning JS arrays in codecademy with only 3 projects in my directory.\n\nThe answer to all those questions, in my opinion is, it does not matter. Programming != coding, so it doesn't matter how many languages you learn, the thing you should be mainly focused is learning how to solve problems using the syntax. Learn to solve problems with what you have, THAT is the important piece in my opinion.\n\nWhy I think it's important that many beginners grow out of this phase ASAP:\n\n        1. When you start to view languages as what they are, you start to appreciate more what you use. In my case, I don't find JavaScript to be the most charming language, but I love it's rich ecosystem and the fact that I can use it for pretty much anything I want to do.\n\n      2. You risk burning yourself out. This was me three years ago. I had 5 courses on different languages and it polluted my mind with information that I KNEW deep down was completely useless to me in the long run. You could argue that I was getting to see new paradigms and techniques to solving problems, but that wasn't even true. I never made it far enough into ANY course to learn anything that I hadn't seen in JavaScript. It was a waste of time and it lead to me burning out and losing interest, until recently that I finally got back into programming. \n\n      3. You stop thinking and you start doing. When I finally got back into coding recently with better learning habits I started learning and creating projects faster than ever before. Because I wasn't focused on \"Hmmm, maybe I should try out Scala!\", no I was focused on \"What other Data Structures should I learn to implement?\", \"How do I solve this bug?\", \"What should be my next project?\". When you start seeing languages as tools, you'll want to use those tools.\n\nIn conclusion, this is not to say that you shouldn't be curious and you shouldn't ask questions and you shouldn't experiment and you should just stick to one thing and never explore. What I'm trying to say is that, a lot of the time, beginners are so excited to learn that they forget WHY they're learning. Which is to get a job, to be successful, to create something meaningful, to be good at a hobby, etc.. And I feel like if you don't focus on creating and learning and solving, and you're always thinking about what's the future and not the present, then you'll just risk burning yourself out. There are tons of roadmaps out there for whatever you want to build, stick with it or tweak it a little along the way. But don't start a course on Python today and then tomorrow it's SQL and then the next day is HTML and CSS, no. Stick to what you want to do, once you understand the core concepts and programming as a whole, everything else will follow and everything after that will be easier to learn.",

I personally love it and have legitimately found that it has changed my career trajectory for the better. So many advanced concepts felt clear only when I learned Haskell. Most notably concurrent programming. \n\nI also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? \n\nYet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the \"pythonic\" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes \"how come you dont know OOP\" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. \n\nIve also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m writing this because I feel like I’m hitting a wall, and I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nI am a career shifter and currently unemployed. I’ve studied 169 hours in the last 6 weeks. That’s nearly 30 hours a week of solo learning. I was motivated, consistent, and determined. I finished Angela Yu’s Python course and felt proud of myself. I even pushed into more advanced topics like data science, Python scripting, Leetcode, OOP, and I bought a cybersecurity course too.\n\nBut now? I feel completely lost. I don’t know what to focus on anymore. The worst part is: I actually know what I want, I love data science. I enjoy exploring it, building things, and seeing the insights come to life. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel like I don’t have a real future in it because I’ve always struggled with math, and that makes me doubt myself. (Right now, I’m not even struggling with the math yet. It’s mostly basic stuff so far. But I keep worrying about the more advanced math that’s coming, and that fear holds me back before I even get there.)\n\nI also love Python. I genuinely enjoy writing code and want to keep going with it. But we all know that just knowing Python isn’t enough anymore especially with how fast AI is changing the game. That’s what led me to consider cybersecurity, thinking it might be a more stable and future-proof path.\n\nBut deep down, I feel like I’ve already found what I want to do. And the idea of abandoning data science just because it’s hard or because I’m scared I won’t be good enough, feels really painful. Like I’m betraying something I actually care about, just to play it safe.\n\n\nI’ve also been: Tracking all my hours in Notion (which now just feels like pressure), Sleeping poorly (constant programming dreams, multiple wake-ups), Eating badly (2 months of junk and no routine).\n\n\nI thought I was making progress, but lately I just feel stuck. Not lazy. Just drained. Burned out. Lost in too many options.\n\nIf anyone here has been through something similar, how did you reset? How did you regain direction and momentum without burning out again?",

        "content": "I was a Java programmer with a solid knowledge of SQL from 2000 till about 2010 before I moved into management roles.  I also wrote two books on SQL back around Y2K.  \n\nWhen I joined my current company I was actually hoping to get to be more hands on again, but the reality was my role didn't call for it... until now.  Our new CTO wants dev managers to be more \"player coaches\".  So I am actually pretty keen about learning my stack which is primarily node.js, react and postgres based and API standards are important.\n\nSo my question is how best to efficiently learn the stack in 2025.  I will need to learn syntax, and I will need to learn mechanisms that I have not worked with before, eg: promises - as asynchronous programming was not prevalent when I was a programmer.  \n\nBack in the day, I learned very well reading good books - I remember a book about Java by Ivor Horton from WROX that I read back to front in a matter of days.  But I wouldn't say all books were of that level.  I even read all the IBM books on DB2 to learn the product and become strong on databases.\n\nOver the years I have dabbled with Udemy courses, but I find them far too inefficient to consume in video format in comparison to reading.  I did learn some concepts in React and Typescript syntax, but I never completed the courses because frankly they wouldn't have benefited my role at the time and I haven't really coded for fun in some time.\n\nI also tried an ACM membership where I got access to some Safari books as well as well as Pluralsight courses which were better I found than Udemy - but lacked much one the node.js front (perhaps limited by the ACM offering).  The Safari books were ok, but not necessarily that well written.\n\nI'm looking for what is likely to be the best path forward for me.  Appreciate any tips you can offer.",

        "content": "Hello :)\n\nBit of a context, I graduated from IT highschool and now I am first year undergraduate studying bioinformatics. I know a bit of C, C#, Java and Python. In school, I always excelled at tasks \"this is goal\", but when we had a \"do a project of your choice\", I struggled and done something super simple. \n\nI think I am decent at figuring how to reach a goal someone else gave me. But I realised I have no clue how to use what I write outside of the pressing \"run\" in the IDE. \n\nBest example:  \nI wanna make a mp3 out of Pi zero. I already done python youtube downloader a while ago. But when I want to run it, I go into PyCharm, press run, paste the link into the terminal and it works. But now I want to make a bash sctipt that I will call with alias + the link and I want the bash script to use the python code and then send the sound file into the Pi. But... How do I use the python code passivly? Aka how do I input the link from outside? how do I run it? How do I know the sound is downloaded and is ready to be sent?\n\nI am not necesserily looking for answer for This One Example. Because it's far from the only time I have no clue how to apply my code. And I can probably solve it with some googling. But the example shows a massive hole in my knowlage. A hole I have no clue how to start patching, and I feel like school won't help me patch it either. Is there a way to start learning how to use the code I write? Could you maybe give me some ideas for projects that might help me learn so?\n\nLuckly, bioinformatics is the one direction where these fancy printf statements might be enough... But it's not enough for me.\n\nThank you for your time reading this and any advices.",

        "author": "AxelsOG",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I started up on learning Python again and have made more progress than previous attempts and I'm starting to enjoy it a bit more now. But I've started by using Grok simply as a baseline starting point because I've always had trouble \"just learning\" and if I have no structure it tends to be difficult. I understand its probably not great long term, but I'm just simply using it to guide, but I'm also relying on other documentation and other sources online beyond a baseline \"Try and do this, maybe try and implement this and go in this general direction\"\n\nBut anyway, the suggestion it gave me was a program that checks whether a number is odd or even. My first iteration was made because I didn't read what it was supposed to be and ended up making a program that had a list of preset numbers, picked a random number from that list and checked if it was even or odd.\n\nSince I realized that wasn't what I was 'supposed' to do, I actually realized what I should have done and made this.\n\nWhat it's intended to do is request a valid positive integer, and check if its even or odd. It ignores any negative integers, any numbers 'too larger' (which I added simply to continue learning new stuff), and anything that isn't a number.\n\nIt also gives you 3 tries to input a valid integer before closing after too many tries. I also made it so the \"attempts remaining\" will either say \"attempts\" or \"attempt\" based on whether you have multiple attempts left, or only 1 attempt remaining.\n\nAnd this works exactly as intended on the user side. I may be overthinking this, but I was wondering if there was a way to optimize it or make it more 'efficient' when checking if the number is less than 0 or if the number is too large. Even though it works exactly as intended, I was wondering if this code was 'bad' even though it works. I don't want to develop any bad coding habits or make things longer/harder than they need to be. \n\n    from time import sleep\n    max_attempts = 3 #Total attempts allowed.\n    attempts = 0 #Attempt starting value. \n    number = None\n    \n    print('This program checks if a number is even or odd.') #Welcomes the user.\n    \n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            number = int(input('Enter a valid non-negative integer: '))\n            if number < 0:\n                attempts += 1\n                remaining = max_attempts-attempts ##Defines remaining as maximum attempts minus wrong attempts\n                if attempts < max_attempts:\n                    print(f\"Invalid input!

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been taking CS50 and recently got deep into working with linked lists, jump pointers, and even thinking about skip lists. While exploring those, a strange but exciting thought hit me:\n\n**What if our brains think more like a skip list or hash map — not systematically, but through jumps, associations, and links?**\n\nFor example, when you recall a memory or idea, you don’t scan every single thought one by one. You jump — smell a scent, remember a moment, link that to a person, then to an emotion. It’s like `pointer->next->emotion->event`. That's not a loop — that’s a graph traversal.\n\nYet, most of our schooling — and even programming tutorials — teach in a **linear, step-by-step**, \"systematic\" fashion.\n\nSo I started asking myself:\n\n* **Is scattered thinking more efficient than linear thinking in real-world problem solving?**\n* **Are skip lists, hash tables, or even neural networks just computer science rediscovering how the brain works?**\n* **Are we training students to think linearly when the real world rewards associative, messy, linked thought?**\n\nCS50 didn’t just teach me how to code — it made me question how I think, and whether our brains already use probabilistic, efficient structures far beyond simple loops and arrays.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from others. Am I overthinking? Or is there something big here?\n\n",

That's more important.\n\nWhat I started doing was writing the assignment down and figuring out for myself what I need to write the program. If things don't run I'll check my notes, search geeksforgeeks, stack overflow etc, DONT READ THE AI OVERVIEW! That code was even more confusing. Get in the habit of reading things. Im in a C++ class so cppreference is a good source too.\n\nYou'll make mistakes. You need that. Thats how you become a better programmer. I finally understood the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value parameters in functions because I had to fix my bad code. Then I could really understand what the books where saying.\n\nSide note. Grow your simple programs into something complex. I wrote a small inventory program when we were learning about loops and then I forgot about it. I picked it up again and  I moved the code into a function. Then the next version I separated the function into two. A reading function and printing function. The next version will use a class and objects. Your program gets an upgrade. And leave yourself notes on what you want to add or change to your program. Another thing that helps too. It's on my GitHub if anyone wants to see. Nothing amazing but I'm proud.\n\nYou do all the thinking. Thats a real test. Good luck.",

The instruction on the example was that the function was using the SDL\\_INIT\\_VIDEO as a flag. I searched a bit and I cam across an example that said that flags are just variables that control a loop. Like:\n\n`bool flag = true;`  \n`int loops = 0;`\n\n\n\n`while(flag)`  \n`{`  \n`++loops;`  \n`std::cout << “Current loop is: ” << loops << std::endl;`\n\n`if(loops > 10)`  \n`{`  \n`flag = false;`  \n`}`  \n`}`\n\n  \nIs it all what SDL\\_INIT\\_VIDEO is doing there? Just controling a loop inside the function? Since I can't see the SDL\\_INIT function definition (the documentation doesn't show it), I can only assume that there might be a loop inside it. ",

I have this desire to program, I don't mind programming, I freaking love typing and just really thinking all of this out.

I don't know any really good place where I can learn from, that's 100% free, and for a complete dummy, as if they were talking to a 5-year-old.

I can see you reading your responses off a screen, and you know what… that’s fine.  You maybe had some canned answers ready.\n\nI ask you follow up questions and you need a minute to think, that’s great.  Take your time.  I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.\n\nBut if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question.  If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice.  If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.\n\nIn short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion.

Solving a difficult bug leaves a mark on your soul you don’t forget the details.

Not just within the tech industry, but even outside it. Say you work at Google or Meta, and people automatically assume you’re smart, accomplished, probably making great money, and overall just... impressive.\n\nEven socially, there’s a noticeable difference. Whether it’s friends, family, or even on hook-up apps, having \"Software Engineer at Amazon\" in your profile seems to carry a different weight.\n\nIt’s like there’s a kind of crazy prestige that comes with being in FAANG. Like you’re in a different league, not just professionally but socially too.\n\nAnd obviously recruiters and managers seem to be obsessed with hiring ex-FAANG engineers. It's like a guaranteed callback.\n\nThe title also seems to stick with you forever. Work at Google for a year, and you are suddenly an ex-google engineer for your entire career.\n\nNo doubt working at FAANG is perceived as something that is prestigious, both technically and socially. It's life changing.\n\nBut is that perception actually earned?\n\nAre FAANG engineers genuinely more skilled than the average developer? Do they consistently write better code, design more complex systems, think more rigorously? Or is it just a really effective combination of brand power, selective hiring, and market perception?\n\nI’m not denying that great engineers exist outside FAANG, but it seems like people expect the best to be there. Is that just a societal illusion, or is there some truth to it?\n\nWould love to hear from folks who’ve worked both in and out of FAANG.

It's insane how fast this product degraded.\n\nTakes forever to load, extremely clunky, and basic tasks that should take seconds end up turning into frustrating multi-minute ordeals. The UI is bloated, performance is inconsistent, and the AI suggestions are more noise than help. It's like they’re trying to automate everything except the parts that actually matter to users.\n\nThis is textbook technical debt. When CEOs start offshoring and using AI, it might seem like it's working at first. But software engineering is all about the long game. It takes proactive decisions in the present, to avoid extreme amounts of technical debt in the future. Decisions made today have vast repercussions on outcomes several months and years from now.\n\nThis shortsightedness of CEOs is a joke. They are straight up ruining their products without even realizing it. In a few years there is going to be ***so much*** technical debt everywhere and we're the ones who are going to have to clean it up.\n\nHave you folks noticed this with any other software?",

A lot of them are socially awkward or really into anime and etc., and it makes it hard to connect. I feel like an outsider even though I’m in the same field. There’s no real teamwork or sense of belonging, just people working in silos and making small talk about stuff I can’t relate to.\n\nLately, I’ve even been thinking about going back to school, but I have no idea what I’d study or what path would actually feel worth it. \n\nI guess I’m just wondering if anyone else feels the same.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Intro.**\n\nI wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.\n\n**Story time.**\n\nAt first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.\n\nOver the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.\n\nAfter five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.\n\nI feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.\n\n**Where I applied.**\n\nAbout 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.\n\n**The numbers.**\n\nNow for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).\n\n**Advice.**\n\nOver the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a \"Skills\" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.\n\nDon't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.\n\nI spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",

More looking for ways to improve our existing product with new things. \n\nI have some friends who have been laid off, and it's got me thinking, or overthinking as of late if this gravy boat were to go away what would happen.\n\nOther devs maybe in this situation, how do you feel? Are you planning for the worst career wise? Or just focused on the day to day? Trying to make yourself as valuable as possible in your current role?\n\nAre people doubling down on AI? Focusing more on architecture solutions? Pivoting to security? Etc?",

The first was about my undergrad degree, they couldn’t verify my enrollment dates. The second was about my PhD, they verified the degree but had different dates that were longer than the actual time I was there.\nThe final thing was about a part time teaching assistant job I had in undergrad, which I did for 3 years, they said I only did it for 8 months.\n\nThey didn’t ask me for additional evidence, I do have paystubs, transcripts, and W2 forms ,and just sent it to the company directly! Now I’m really nervous about this. Has anyone gone through something similar? How did it go? \n\nThanks in advance! \n\nUpdate!\n\nThe company approved me without asking for any additional information!\n\nFuck HireRight for running my 4th of July weekend over this nonsense.",

Yet it all feels useless in this current time. Makes me wonder if my school's ranking has been my limiter.\n\nI know other people are going through very similar things, yet when someone vents about their struggles on this Subreddit, it's experienced devs currently in the industry regurgitating LinkedIn advice that many of us have tried with no results. In fact, they start to just assume things about the poster and call them a doomer, when all they want to do is be heard. I do agree that some posts are outlandish, and the poster has a poorly written resume or something, but there are many of us who just want to be encouraged to keep going, or receive advice + reality checks of the current market that will actually help us calculate next steps. I try to scroll this Subreddit every day to see if there's encouragement or good advice, but a lot of it is really just putting hard and smart workers looking to just get an opportunity down for not being hardworking or smart enough.\n\n  \nIdk, the more that I keep going with no results, the more I feel helpless. At least I want to build / look for a community that can support each other's struggles during these tough times. However, I do understand that many devs who are already in the industry are annoyed by the helpless and doomer posts. So I don't want to invade this Subreddit with that stuff after this post, but if you are struggling like me and reading this, you are not alone, and I hope you take care of your mental health first.

I've redone my resume numerous times tailoring for each job and even when I match their job description, it gets ghosted or rejected. \n\nCan't apply for an intern position, even if it means taking a massive pay cut, because I have a junior level experience. Can't get interviews for jobs with matching experience and technologies. Can't get interviews for jobs with same experience but different tech stack.\n\nI'm not asking to be a perfect match but rather a chance as a junior developer to learn. I might not know about Next.js but I know React to some extent so I CAN pick up a new tech if they just provided me a chance. Throughout my life, I've had a thing about learning skills pretty quick but no company gives me a chance to showcase that. In an ocean full of resumes, I can't make myself standout more than the average. \n\nWith new tech popping out ever so often, it's hard to keep track of it whilst also not trying to burn myself out. I can't understand how I can have a work life balance when during free time I'm expected to keep up with new tech and do personal projects. Not to mention, companies want professional experience in said tech stack so learning on my own doesn't count. I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle trying to apply on my own and the only way to get through is through connections which I'm having a bad luck with.\n\nAs a junior, I want to learn new stuff. I don't want to be stuck with the same tech stack or field. I want to explore till I find a realm I enjoy working in. It's my beginning years to explore, yet I can't find an opportunity.\n\nIs it really a luck game in this industry? How do I start improving my chances? I'm desperate...\n\n",

I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface, and yet I’m also falling behind on other big topics like AI, embedded systems, applications, back end dev, stuff like that.  And with how bad the job market is, I can imagine getting a graphics job entry level is a pain in the ass and most of it prob requires masters or PhD.  \n\nSo am I wasting time and should I figure out another more practical project or thing to learn?

I'm a front-end developer, ux-designer and startup founder who wants to become a product manager. \n\nI'm struggling to decide how I want to sell myself during interviews and on my CV. \n\nThese are the points I'm struggling with:\n\n* I'm introverted, love to listen and ask a lot of questions. \nI have the feeling PMs are expected to be extroverted and spew out energy - especially during an interview. Should I fake it? \n* If I don't know something I say it. \nI feel like these days everybody is looking for the perfect candidate. “You don't know x or y? Next!” At least this is how it goes for dev roles. Should I pretend to know everything and wing it? (this question applies to resumes, too) \n* I am humble and quite frankly I should be because neither have I founded a million dollar company nor worked in big tech yet. \nTo me it seems like during the interview phase you have to present yourself like you are the big shit and exaggerate everything you have done. Because this is exactly what everybody else does. At least for dev roles there are programming tests that show real skills. Should I exaggerate my past successes?\n* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. \nTo me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM “knows his stuff”? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? \n* I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobs\nTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems “real”. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? \n\nI hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub. If not, please excuse me. \n\nThanks a lot. \n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a recent grad from a U.S. university and a U.S. citizen. I recently got an SDE offer at Amazon. However, my offer letter and onboarding portal were all for a Vancouver, BC role, even though I’m in the U.S. and have never held a Canadian status.\n\nNaturally, I got super confused because the onboarding materials all referenced Canadian work authorization, SIN numbers, and pathways for Canadian citizens, international students, etc. I emailed Amazon’s onboarding team asking for clarification, explaining that I’m a U.S. citizen with no Canadian status and no idea how to start the work permit process.\n\nI received a reply today and was told that I should have received a U.S. offer, not a Canadian one. Furthermore, the Vancouver offer is to be canceled, and a new U.S. offer was promised by “end of day.”\n\nHowever, it is now evening, and I still haven’t received the new offer.\n\nMy original onboarding timeline mentioned a deadline of July 7th to accept the offer and complete a survey (which I completed, though with answers which apply to the Canada offer).\n\nThe Vancouver offer has definitely been revoked, attempting to access the employment documents states that I do not have an account. Tomorrow is July 4th, then the weekend, and then July 7th is Monday. I’m scared some automated system might cancel my candidacy entirely if there’s no active offer in the system by the deadline.\n\nI’m not sure if there is anything I should do in the meantime. I have already replied to the email regarding the promised U.S. offer and am hesitant to contact further, given that I have already emailed 2x today. I just don’t want to let this slip through the cracks.\n\nShould I follow up again tomorrow or wait until Monday? Will Amazon’s systems actually auto-cancel an onboarding if there’s no active offer in place?\n\nAny advice is hugely appreciated. I'm just worried about getting lost in the system due to the timeline and offer error.",

        "content": "I joined a fairly large company (non-tech, although they are trying to make it otherwise) as a SWE along with a few hundred other new grads as part of a cohort. We didn't interview for a specific team and were basically placed semi-randomly onto teams that asked for SWEs.\n\nI ended up on a team that is primarily a support team. The team is mostly non-SWEs and at no point has there been any SWE on the team that didn't have the position as their first job out of college. About 60-70% of the team's day to day work consists of data remediation and other manual fixes (e.g. directly modifying data in databases) for errors caused by bugs in the systems we support. These bugs have existed the entire 2 years I've been here, and apparently longer, from what I've heard. The remainder of the work might be other random tasks geared towards facilitating the first function (e.g. writing up documentation on how to do a certain kind of fix, setting up alerting based off of logs).\n\nThe only \"dev\" work that I end up doing is writing basic CRUD applications used only by our team that are hosted on on-premise servers (our team has no cloud budget so I have no experience building applications in the cloud). There's no opportunity to work on any large-scale, high traffic systems. I essentially haven't worked on anything more complex than my college work.\n\nOther people that were part of my cohort were placed on teams where they are on actual engineering teams and the work is a lot more interesting, so this is primarily a team placement issue, not necessarily a company issue. However, I've become painfully aware that my skills have been stagnating hard and I need to get out of this role ASAP. The only thing is I've been a \"software engineer\" for 2 years, but having to talk about what I've been doing in my current role makes it glaringly obvious that I was a SWE in name only. What steps should I take to make up for this? What should I study on my own to at least have some level of familiarity with things a junior SWE would be expected to know?",

I applied to openings in other cities, but the the number of openings were so little compared to the number of applicants so the competition was crazy, I couldn't get a job for about a year.\n\nAfterwards, I found a role as a teacher, so, I started teaching programming fundamentals and web development, I kept this job for 2 years, during which I tried applying to as much software development jobs as possible on LinkedIn and everywhere else, mainly looking for fully remote roles in the US or elsewhere.\n\nThen, I found a role at a startup as a paid intern, gotten through the interview and started work as a contractor.\n\nMy initial contract was for 6 months, after that was over I signed a different contract for another 6 months, this time as a Jr. Software Developer. After this contract ended, they renewed it again as a Jr. Software Developer, but this time for 4 months, because the startup was failing. So, in total I worked as fully remote contractor for 1 year and 4 months.\n\nThen, I was jobless, I started looking for jobs again for about 6 months, then out of nowhere, the same employer from before got in touch with me and recommended me to a different startup looking for contractors. I happily accepted the offer and started work, the problem is, I wasn't even assigned a title in this new startup, I was a software developer, but I didn't know whether Jr, Mid? However, based on my own evaluation I still considered myself Jr.\n\nI was the only developer on the frontend team for this new startup, I was responsible of taking a full Figma design from scratch and implement it with React, I have to be honest I had to use a component library to get the job done, because the deadline was very close and everything was fast paced, there was no room for code refactoring, code quality, TBF I didn't even write tests! But, I ended up delivering in time, and after a couple of rounds of bug fixing, the client was happy.\n\nHowever, after about 8 months, I lost this job because the startup failed to secure funding again.\n\nNow, I feel a bit lost on where to move on from here. Getting a job for a US-based employer is very difficult, especially once they learn that I am based in Iraq.\n\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n1. Am I a dead cause? Is there still hope? I mean I am still a Jr.\n\n2. How should I structure my resume? I have no past projects other than the work I've put for my past 2 employers?",

On one hand, it's a lot more than junior work like building specific features and testing them - it involves interviewing stakeholders, learning their needs, and figuring out how to translate that into features and how to design the software to be able to grow sustainably without having a team of other developers to lean on. On the other hand, for all I know it could be riddled with bad habits and blind spots.\n\nMost job postings with PhD qualifications are mid- to advanced-stage roles, but having not \"grown up\" in a \"professional\" team environment, I'm not sure I have the relevant experience to be able to head a team in a conventional, expected way. At the same time, while I personally don't have hang-ups about starting lower on the totem pole, I'm not sure if my experience and degree path would make me appear over-qualified for a more entry position? As in, over-qualified but under-skilled, so, pass and on to the next candidate. Opinions, or do you have experience hiring folks with \"unconventional\" career paths?",

So when it comes to adapting the skills obtained during a PhD and in me cases research assistantships past the PhD, and convincing others that you can transfer your skills, what works best?\n\nWith some companies, particularly in this economic climate, they'll be looking for industry experience and that's it. It won't matter about published papers and successful projects. It won't matter if much of your research is in an applicable field such as data science. Side projects you've done independently may not even matter. It has to be experience in industry or it doesn't count. And often, it needs to be with the exact software tools, models and packages they use in addition.\n\nThat said, I was wondering about what works when adapting your skills and also making the case to others about how you can do so. A primary option, I imagine, is being able to relate to them, for example how a paper and project you finished has implications that could assist them with their data handling, product development and so on. Or perhaps reaching out and explaining concisely how the skills you developed, even though they weren't directly in industry, could be applied to solve a problem they have.\n\nAre there methods and techniques similar to this that work?",

My university does allow double majoring at no additional costs though. I realize that I'm a bit of an exceptional case here and more privileged in the sense that I don't have to deal with F1, H1B visa rat race at all. That said, on hearing the situation of the world, in particular the US, the job market seems extremely bad. My family lives on an Indian income and while the aid we got from my university was quite generous, we've still taken a federal loans from both the US and education loans from SBI, leasing one of the property homes that we have. This honestly puts a lot of pressure on me, like any other international student because India is all I've known and frankly I've never exceeded very well academically at all.\n\nI realize that my questions are a bit immature maybe, but I think I'd still like the opinions and discussions of people who are more knowledgeable about this than I am:\n\n* How hard do you think it'll be for people like me to find jobs/placements 4 years later when I graduate? \n* I've been hearing that the best way to succeed is to have connections, network and stuff.

What should I expect? Is it recommended that I come back to India at all?\n* What are some contingency plans I should have? I'm not particularly passionate about anything, I chose CS because my entire family works there and so having their help would be nice, plus hearing them talk about their job and interest for it made me interested as well. If CS/IT is cooked, I'm thinking maybe Business or Finance is a better option? I've decided to pursue it as a minor. If I were to make a switch, how do you think I should make it happen so that even those career paths are open to me?\n\nLots of questions here, but I'd really appreciate any and all help!

        "title": "Junior Developer Paradox: Finding Niche and Doing so in Wrong Time",
        "author": "TemporaryBaseball915",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello guys, I'm writing this because I recently (with full awareness) threw myself into what seems to be still waters, the junior developer job hunt. Now, this is not just another generic web dev (not my words, the vim/arch lovers' words) crying for help. No, no, and no! This is someone who found their \"niche\" but at the wrong time. Let me tell you what I mean.\n\nSo, I recently graduated from a university in the U.S. During the time I was there, I fell in love with Machine Learning (and no, it's not because it's the trend). I found myself devoting my time to research, machine learning projects, doing competitions within the lab with other PhD or Masters students, etc. I was involved in the research for 2+ years for three different labs, I had the official title of \"Research Assistant\" as an undergrad for one of the labs where I was the sole engineer to develop end-to-end solution for running experiments on our university's super computer. I have published a paper in CVPR, and got the best paper award within the workshop that we've published.\nNow, my life had a solid plan, but due to everything changed in the states (I'm not gonna say why because I don't wanna take a one-way trip to Central America) I was forced to derail from that path. And now I am looking for a job. And man, doesn't it fucking suck. And this is where the paradox begins:\n\n**Paradox 1: \"X+ years of experience\" for recent graduate position**\nLet's start with the most common paradox. Now, the definition of \"experience\" differs from company to company, but what seems to be the common thing though, is that research doesn't count toward \"experience\". I know some of the undergrads who have somewhere around 1 year of experience due to things like internships or co-op (it's like internship in Canada but better), but for a lot of other students, this is going to be their first experience. Especially for someone like me who has experience but within the University, this sucks. What sucks even more, is that for a lot of international students, getting internship is very hard due to company having to justify as to why they're hiring an international student over a citizen with the same skill set. I was one of the victims of \"logistical rejection\" and that's kind of why I devoted more time within the University system because in it, it's an equal fight. Whoever has skills wins.\n\n**Paradox 2: Master's degree or PhD is required**\nThis is especially true for machine learning engineer jobs, but the same thing can be applied to other jobs as well. Now, in my opinion, the difference between a bachelor's and master's is that if you're getting a bachelor's, what it says is you are someone who is capable of starting something small, and finish it. Maybe you have little bit of side project here and there, but nothing crazy. If you have a master's, what it says is that you can start and finish medium-sized projects, and you can also sometimes be a leader within the project as well. PhD is just matter of scaling up from master's. Now, this is what a degree \"generally\" says about you, because if you're an undergrad, companies don't expect you to develop a niche. But here's the thing, I did. I have a lot of experience in machine learning just like I said at the beginning, but company doesn't care about that because I am not a master's student. You have publications? Doesn't matter, you're an undergrad. You developed a deep learning model by yourself? Doesn't matter, you don't have a master's.\n\nNow, for those who just thought to yourself \"just get a master's bro\", here's paradox 3. \n\n**Paradox 3: I ain't got no money like that** \nThis might be surprising for some of you but there are people who genuinely don't have money. And surprise, surprise, I don't have money. I want to work in industry to save money to go back to a master's program, but if I want to look for a job paradox 1 and paradox 2 appear, but if I want to get a master's, I need money first to even go there in the first place. And yes scholarship is a thing and definitely helps, but I need full-ride scholarship if I want to go, but those opportunities don't easily come around.\n\n**Paradox 4: Connection matters**\nNow, I'm not saying this statement is the paradox, but what I hear from people who are already in the system is a paradox. When I talk about these things to people who have already established themselves, they oftentimes say \"It's not about degree\" or \"If you can show that you have the skill, that's all we care about\". Now, as an engineer, they are right. It is not about degree, as long as you have the skills. But, at the same time they are not the one who is looking at my resume, it's the HR or sometime LLMs. Now I don't have the \"experience\" so I don't know how companies work, but should engineers hire another engineer? Or I guess they don't have the time so HR exists? I don't know.\n\n**Paradox 5: It's a tough time right now**\nFor like 4 years it has been a tough time, bro. Damn.\n\n**Paradox 6: Just find a generic soft dev job**\nThis is usually what I get from people when I talk about these paradoxes. \"You know, the hardest part is to get your foot in the system. I think you should apply for a software engineering job first and go from there.\" So I said \"bet\" and applied to a bunch (I mean a bunch) of software engineering jobs. But they all say no because I am too specialized in machine learning. Welp, wtf.\n\nThese are the paradoxes that I can think of right now. And I know that I used the term \"paradox\" very loosely here, but I hope you can see my point of view. And with all the seriousness, this is why I say I found the niche at the wrong time. Because I slowly began to realize that I was going nowhere with my ML skills, because the world is not obligated to take time to see what each person is capable of. I get it, people just generally don't have time.\n\nAnd here comes the million dollar question: What do I do now then? I am stuck between these paradoxes and the walls around me are getting tighter and tighter. I really need help.\n\nThanks guys for reading this far, and I really appreciate it.",

        "content": "Hey all, I’m looking for some grounded advice on two very different career opportunities I’m considering. I’ve been in tech for 25+ years, and while I usually trust my gut, this one feels like a fork in the road I want to be intentional about.\n\n**Current Role:**  \nI’m a senior systems engineer with wide-reaching access across Azure, AWS, and M365. I also own GitHub and other platform automation efforts. I lead the ops side of our compliance initiatives and genuinely enjoy the pace and technical depth of my work.\n\nThe catch? The team culture feels shady. In just 7 months, 5 people have left. That kind of turnover makes me nervous, even though I’m thriving technically.\n\n**Option 1 – Internal Lateral Move:**  \nI’ve been offered an internal lateral move into a DevOps Tech Lead role. This would shift me into a more client-facing, consultative position where I’d build and solution for external customers. The role is fully remote (big plus), and I’d stay within the same company—but I haven’t yet negotiated for a raise.\n\nPros:\n\n* Fully remote\n* Leverages my existing reputation and platform knowledge\n* Expands into client-facing/consulting experience\n* I will get out from under the 'bad VP' that Is causing the turnover in the current org.\n\nCons:\n\n* No raise yet discussed. If I got a raise it would really make this a no brainer.\n\n**Option 2 – Startup Leadership Role:**  \nI’ve also been offered a role at a small but promising IoT startup. I’d be managing a small team of engineers (3 to start), and I’ve already spoken with the CTO, founder, and team. The tech is solid, and I can definitely succeed here. Remote for now, but will go hybrid (3 days in office) after about a year.\n\nBenefits include PPO health and possible profit sharing (my first time seeing this), but there’s no formal bonus structure.\n\nPros:\n\n* Leadership opportunity with real influence\n* Startup energy and vision feels exciting\n* Room to grow with equity/profit potential\n\nCons:\n\n* Less stability than my current gig\n* Hybrid in a year\n* No bonus structure\n\n**What would you do in my shoes?**  \nHave you made a similar jump—from enterprise to startup or internal to client-facing?  \nWhat questions would you ask yourself in this situation?\n\nThanks in advance for any perspective you can offer.",
