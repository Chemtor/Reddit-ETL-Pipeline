        "content": "TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platform\n\nI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.\n\nNow, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\n\n\\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\n\n\\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\n\n\\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENT\n\nEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).\n\nObviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\n\n\\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\n\n\\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\n\n\\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\n\n\\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\n\n\\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).\n\nI’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.\n\nHow do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",

Even other teams commonly call us \"devs.\"\n\nThis has me wondering:\n\nIs this just common industry language?\n\nOr is it a sign that the data engineering role is being blended into general development work?\n\nDo you also feel that your work is viewed more like backend/dev work than a specialized data role?\n\n\nJust curious how others experience this. Would love to hear what your role looks like in practice and how your org views data engineering as a discipline.\n\nThanks!\n",

        "content": "I'm somewhat struggling right now and I could use some advice or stories from anyone who's been in a similar spot.\n\nI work on a data team at a company that doesn't really value standardization or process improvement. We just recently started using GIT for our SQL development and while the team is technically adapting to it, they're not really embracing it. There's a strong resistance to anything that might be seen as \"overhead\" like data orchestration,  basic testing, good modelling, single definitions for business logic, etc. Things like QA or proper reviews are not treated with much importance because the priority is speed, even though it's very obvious that our output as a team is often chaotic (and we end up in many \"emergency data request\" situations).\n\nThe problem is that the work we produce is often rushed and full of issues. We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.\n\nIt's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly. I want to build things that are scalable, maintainable, and accurate. But I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle and I'm starting to burn out from caring too much when no one else seems to.\n\nIf you've ever been in a situation like this, how did you handle it? How do you keep your mental health intact when you're the only one pushing for quality? Did you stay and try to change things over time or did you eventually leave?\n\nAny advice, even small things, would help.\n\nPS: I'm not a manager - just a humble analyst 😅\n\n",

This is not mentioned anywhere in the contract, and you get to know only after joining and paying the amount.\nWhen I asked why can’t I access and why is this not menioned in the contract, their response was, it is written in the contract what we offer, which is misleading. \nIn the initial calls before joining, they emphasized more on these courses as an highlight.\n\n- Had to ping multiple times to get a basic review on CV.\n\n- 1:1 session can only be scheduled twice with a coach. There are many students enrolled now, and very few coaches are available. Sometimes, the availability of the coaches is more than 2 weeks away.\n\n- Coaches and their teams response time is quite slow. Sometimes the coaches don’t even respond. Only 1:1 was a good experience.\n\n- Sometimes the group sessions gets cancelled with no prior information, and they provide no platform to check if the session will begin or not.\n\n- Job application process and their follow ups are below average. They did not follow the job location preference and where just randomly appling to any DE role irrespective of which level you belong to.\n\n- For the job applications, they initially showed a list of referrals supported, but were not using that during the application process. Had to intervene multiple times, and then only a few of those companies from the referral list were used. \n\n- Had to start applying on my own, as their job search process was not that reliable.\n\n————————————————————————\nOverall, except the 1:1 with the coaches, I felt there was no benefit. They take a hughe amount, instead taking multiple online DE courses would have been a better option.",

        "author": "Ok-Comfortable7656",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "TL;DR: I have 7 years of experience in data engineering. Just got laid off. Now I’m choosing between staying in my comfort zone (another data role) or jumping into a potential CTO position at a startup—where I’d have to learn the MERN stack from scratch. Torn between safety and opportunity.\n\nBackground:\nI’m 28 and have spent the last 7 years working primarily as a Cloud Data Engineer (most recently in a Lead role), with some Solutions Engineering work on the side. I got laid off last week and, while still processing that, two new paths have opened up. One’s predictable. The other’s risky but potentially career-changing.\n\nOption 1: Potential CTO role at a trading startup\n\n• Small early-stage team (2–3 engineers) building a medium-frequency trading platform for the Indian market (mainly F&O)\n\n• A close friend is involved and referred me to manage the technical side, they see me as a strong CTO candidate if things go well\n\n• Solid funding in place; runway isn’t a concern right now\n\n• Stack is MERN, which I’ve never worked with! I’d need to learn it from the ground up\n\n• They’re willing to fully support my ramp-up\n\n• 2–3 year commitment expected\n\n• Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning before\n\nOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client\n\n• Work involves building a data platform on GCP\n\n• Very much in my comfort zone; I’ve done this kind of work for years\n\n• Slight pay bump\n\n• Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant—low learning, low risk\n\nWhat’s tearing me up:\n\n• The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader\n\n• My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands\n\n• But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience—am I killing my momentum?\n\n• What if the startup fails? Will a 2–3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?\n\n• The safe choice is obvious—but the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experience\n\nPersonal context:\n\n• I don’t have major financial obligations right now—so if I ever wanted to take a risk, now’s probably the time\n\n• My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I’d want to commit fully for at least a couple of years\n\nQuestions for you all:\n\n• Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?\n\n• If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?\n\n• Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?\n\n• Or am I overthinking this entirely?\n\n\nThanks for reading this long post—honestly just needed to write it out. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's been through something like this.\n",

Understandable, but frustrating they didn’t flag it earlier.\n\nWhat’s bothering me:\n\t•\tThey reposted the job as “new” just yesterday\n\t•\tThey rescheduled my final round for next week\n\nIt’s starting to feel like they’re reopening the pipeline and keeping me as a backup while exploring new candidates.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar?\nAny advice on how to close the deal from here or stand out in the final stage would mean a lot. It’s been a tough ride, and I’m trying to stay hopeful.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

        "content": "Hey r/DataEngineering!  \nI’m a master’s student, and I just wrapped up my big data analytics project where I tried to solve a problem I personally care about as a gamer: **how can indie devs make sense of hundreds of thousands of Steam reviews?**\n\nMost tools either don’t scale or aren’t designed with real-time insights in mind. So I built something myself — a **distributed review analysis pipeline** using Dask, PyTorch, and transformer-based NLP models.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* **Data:** 17M+ Steam reviews (\\~40GB uncompressed), scraped using the Steam API\n* **Hardware:** Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB RAM, RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)\n* **Goal:** Process massive review datasets quickly and summarize key insights (sentiment + summarization)\n\n**Engineering Challenges (and Lessons):**\n\n1. **Transformer Parallelism Pain:** Initially, each Dask worker loaded its own model — ballooned memory use 6x. Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.\n2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.\n3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and:\n   * Spawns optimal number of workers\n   * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM\n   * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU\n4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes — now it's down to \\~2 minutes. 15x speedup.\n\n**Dask Architecture Highlights:**\n\n* Dynamic worker spawning\n* Shared model access\n* Fault-tolerant processing\n* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks\n\n**What I’d Love Advice On:**\n\n* Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?\n* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?\n* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?\n* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?\n* Are there common pitfalls I’m not seeing?\n\n**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:**\n\n* App Store reviews\n* Amazon product sentiment\n* Customer feedback for SaaS tools\n\n🔗 **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)\n\nI've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it\n\n  \nHappy to take any suggestions — would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I don’t have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I’m the one with the most experience in Python. \n\nWe had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute.

It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. \n\nI liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don’t really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I’ve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I’m at a loss. I don’t know how to have something ‘talk’ to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. \n\nI could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup.

Integrations are SSIS packages and scripts that are kind of in version control, data testing is manual, data analysts have no ability to define or alter tables even though they know the SQL. \n\nThe business is expanding!

They're wrapped up in application changes, warehouse changes, and analytics changes, and feel like they have to touch every part of the process or else everything will break (because again, tests are manual and we're only kind of doing version control).\n\nI'm working with the team on how we can address this. My plan is something like:\n\n* Break responsibility apart into the different teams\n   * Application team is responsible for the application DB\n   * DBA team is responsible for the system of record data warehouse and integrations and consults on design decisions\n   * Analytics team is responsible for reports, \\*including any underlying SQL and reporting warehouse structure\\*\n* Advocate for my Hero Dev to take a promotion towards a data architect and design consulting role bridging the teams, with other DBA's taking on more of the development.\n* Work on adding automated testing to our existing SSIS packages, then work towards having them built into a CI/CD process\n* Work with the analyst team on having their own server + database where they can use a framework or even Fabric to manage their tables and semantic layer themselves.\n\nI acknowledge this is a super high-level plan with a lot of hand-waving. However, I'd love to hear if any of you have run this route before. If you have, how did it go? What bit you, what do you wish you had known, what would you do next time?\n\nThanks",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm designing a data architecture and would appreciate input from those with experience in hybrid on-premise + AWS data warehousing setups.\n\nContext\n\n* We run a SaaS microservices platform on-premise using mostly PostgreSQL although there are a few MySQL and MongoDB.\n* The architecture is database-per-service-per-tenant, resulting in many small-to-medium-sized DBs.\n* Combined, the data is about 2.8 TB, growing at \\~600 GB/year.\n* We want to set up a data warehouse on AWS to support:\n   * Near real-time dashboards (5 - 10 minutes lag is fine), these will mostly be operational dashbards\n   * Historical trend analysis\n   * Multi-tenant analytics use cases\n\n# Current Design Considerations\n\nI have been thinking of using the following architecture:\n\n1. CDC from on-prem Postgres using AWS DMS\n2. Staging layer in Aurora PostgreSQL - this will combine all the databases for all services and tentants into one big database -  we will also mantain the production schema at this layer - here i am also not sure whether to go straight to Redshit or maybe use S3 for staging since Redshift is not suited for frequent inserts coming from CDC\n3. Final analytics layer in either:\n   * Aurora PostgreSQL - here I am consfused, i can either use this or redshift\n   * Amazon Redshift - I dont know if redshift is an over kill or the best tool\n   * Amazon quicksight for visualisations\n\nWe want to support both real-time updates (low-latency operational dashboards) and cost-efficient historical queries.\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Near real-time change capture (5 - 10 minutes)\n* Cost-conscious (we're open to trade-offs)\n* Works with dashboarding tools (QuickSight or similar)\n* Capable of scaling with new tenants/services over time\n\n# ❓ What I'm Looking For\n\n1. Anyone using a similar **hybrid on-prem → AWS** setup:\n   * What worked or didn’t work?\n2. Thoughts on using Aurora PostgreSQL as a landing zone vs  S3?\n3. Is Redshift overkill, or does it really pay off over time for this scale?\n4. Any gotchas with AWS DMS CDC pipelines at this scale?\n5. Suggestions for real-time + historical unified dataflows (e.g., materialized views, Lambda refreshes, etc.)",

Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?\n\nOff the top of my head the solutions I've read are:\n\n1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)\n\n2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a \"master\" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.\n\n3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department \"Shops\" - there is no department \"Shops\", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that \"Shops\" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.\n\n4. force child systems to at least incorporate the \"owning\" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.\n\nAre there other design patterns I'm missing?",

Within a couple of years, it may pass this point.\n\n\\- Non-profit pricing or a free basic version is best!\n\n\\- The ability to display 'live' (from true live up to weekly refreshes) major data points on a public website is a huge plus.\n\n\\- I had an absolute nightmare of a time getting a Tableau Trial set up and the customer service was unable to fix a bug on the back end that prevented my email from setting up a demo, so they're out.",

        "content": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m working as a data engineer on a project that follows a Medallion Architecture in Synapse, with bronze and silver layers on Spark, and the gold layer built using Serverless SQL.\n\nFor a specific task, the requirement is to replicate multiple source views exactly as they are — without applying transformations or modeling — directly from the source system into the gold layer. In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.\n\nWhile working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.\n\nI’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.\n\nWhat would you do in this case?\nWould you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?\n\nThanks in advance.",

But not just one, as there are subsets of tasks that do not depend on any other subsets of tasks. So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).\n\nI work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.\n\n1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.\n\n2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.\n\n3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.\n\n4. Create \"dummy tasks\" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.\n\n5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.\n\n6. Dynamically start tasks based on the current workload. This would add extra maintenance, manual dependency processing.\n\nDo you have any better solutions?\n",

My German level is B2 in listening and reading, and about B1 in speaking. I’m a non-EU Master's student in Germany with about one year left until graduation.\n\nMy goal is to build solid proficiency in both the tech stack and the German language over the next year, and then begin applying for jobs. I have no professional experience yet.\n\nBut to be honest—I've been pushing myself really hard for the past few years, and I’m now at the edge of burnout. Recently, I've seen many Reddit posts saying the junior job market is brutal, the IT sector is struggling, and there's a looming threat from AI automation.\n\nI feel lost and mentally exhausted. I'm not sure if all this effort will pay off, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just enjoy my remaining time in the EU and then head back home.\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is there still a realistic chance for someone like me (zero experience, but good German skills and strong tech learning) to break into the German job market—especially in Data Engineering, Cloud Engineering, or even DevOps (I know DevOps is usually a mid-senior role, but still curious)?\n\n\n2. Do you think the job market for Data Engineers in Germany will improve in the next 1–2 years? Or is it becoming oversaturated?\n\n\nI’d really appreciate any honest thoughts or advice.

Going to do some hand-waving here only because I can't control this part of the process (for now), but a process is extracting data from our mainframe system as text (csv), and then compressing the data, and then copying it out to a cloud storage account in S3.\n\nWhy compress it? Well, it does compress well; we see around \\~30% space saved and the data size is not small; we're going from roughly 15GB per extract to down to 4.5GB. These are averages; some days are smaller, some are larger, but it's in this ballpark. Part of the reason for the compression is to save us some bandwidth and time in the file copy.\n\nSo now, I have a spark job to ingest the data into our raw layer, and it's taking longer than I \\*feel\\* it should take. I know that there's some overhead to reading compressed .gzip (I feel like I read somewhere once that it has to read the entire file on a single thread first). So the reads and then ultimately the writes to our tables are taking a while, longer than we'd like, for the data to be available for our consumers.\n\nThe debate we're having now is where do we want to \"eat\" the time:\n\n* Upload uncompressed files (vs compressed) so longer times in the file transfer\n* Add a step to decompress the files before we read them\n* Or just continue to have slower ingestion in our pipelines\n\nMy argument is that we can't beat physics; we are going to have to accept some length of time with any of these options. I just feel as an organization, we're over-indexing on a solution. So I'm curious which ones of these you'd prefer? And for the title: ",

This Function will be triggered twice a day with a timer  \n\\- store the 1-2 static files (Excel export and some other CSV) on an Azure Blob Storage\n\nNever worked with Azure, so I'm wondering what's the best approach how to structure this. I've been dabbling with \\`az\\` and custom commands, until this morning I stumbled upon \\`azd\\` - which looks more to what I need. But there are no templates available for non-http Functions, so I should set it up myself. \n\n( And some context, I've been a webdeveloper for many years now, but slowly moving into data engineering ... it's more fun :D )\n\nAny tips are helpful.

I began with BASIC and assembler on a C64, then I started working professionally with C/C++ then Visual Basic, Lotus Notes, .NET, C#, Java/Spring and now it's mostly JS, Node and React.\n\nI've never been attached to any particular language/technique but looked at what different platforms can offer. It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.\n\nSomething that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.\nBack in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where \"script kiddies\" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later.\n \nSo on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.\n\nEspecially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.\n\nI get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the \"don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts \"like I'm five\". It's a  private tutor that never gets tired of your silly questions.\n\nJust my 5c",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Before saying anything I would like to preface that this is my first time posting in a subreddit, so if I did something wrong somehow I apologize in advance (I chose the resource tag because my main question concerns choosing resources to learn).\n\nI have currently completed my second year in uni and am in the midst of my 3-month summer break. I want to spend these three months focusing on learning full stack development (which for now is my career goal ig), and specifically web development. I have this obsession with doing online courses and improving my skills to get better, and I'm also really looking to do some solid projects and start building my resume/cv. \n\nI scoured the internet and found multiple recommended courses which I've listed below. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of just hoarding work and trying to do everything without a plan and regardless of whether it is redundant or not. Here are the courses I gathered:\n\n- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)\n- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)\n- [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j:toc)\n- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) courses (HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript)\n- [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) -> [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)\n- [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript and FrontEnd course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)\n- [freecodecamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)\n- The roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)\n- [This roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vcu5lm/comment/icgeukp/?context=3) by NiagaraThistle\n\nI want to know which of these courses would be enough for me to become skilled at web dev and also set me on the path to becoming a full stack dev. I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.\n\nTo preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.\nI also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.\n\nAgain would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)\n",

You'd finish a course on Udemy or Coursera and *boom*—screenshot, post it to LinkedIn, maybe even YouTube: \"I completed 10 full-stack dev courses in 2 months!!\" It was all about stacking credentials, even if you hadn't actually built anything yet.\n\nNow it feels like nobody cares. People post their portfolios, small apps, launch their own little SaaS tools, or even tweet out UI clones they built over the weekend. Even beginner YouTubers are documenting \"Building X in 30 days\" instead of \"Which coding bootcamp gave me more certificates.\"\n\nI think a certificate doesn't really prove much anymore. Anyone can follow a tutorial. But building your own thing? That shows actual thinking, effort, and debugging pain.\n\nNot saying certificates are completely useless—they can be a nice way to stay on track or organize your learning—but it feels like hiring managers, other devs care *way* more about what you can show, not what you've watched.\n\nJust curious how others see it:\n\n\\- Do you still collect certs from learning platforms?\n\n\\- Has a certificate *ever* helped you get a job, interview, freelance , or anything like that?\n\n\\- Why do you think they were such a big deal a few years ago?\n\n\\- Would you recommend someone new today focus on getting certificates—or just build stuff?",

The problem began when we were tasked of building an rpg game using a library we didn't know (pygame) in about a month. So I used AI a lot and since then I had been using Ai to code most of my stuff (even my personal projects). The problem began when we had a course where we had to build a full stack app in c# and angular. I made most of the project with Ai again, and was able to understand and explain it quite well. But when it came to do it myself, I found myself lost and didn't know what I should start by doing. I could only code when the steps were told to me clearly. \n\nSo my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning? I actually do enjoy creating stuff and I enjoy coding when I know what to do.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Came across with them via a sponsored video and ran through a few threads here about what people think about it.\n\nLet this be the newest one on them:\n\nGamifying the learning process is a clever idea getting more and more adopted by especially more arduous skill acquisition like that of programming.\n\nAlthough [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) promotes on it, \"gaming\" is not emphasized. It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.\n\n\"Holding hands\" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.\n\nHowever, that's where their \"Socratic\" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.\n\nI did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by \"look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free\" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.\n\nI am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.\n\nI am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \\- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from. Programming-wise, I think there would be better people who are seasoned enough to comment on their curriculum and pace of progress.\n\nCheers.",

I felt proud.\n\n, but nothing stays still so I wanted to improve more, but here it hit me I didn't have a goal nothing to look for not only in python, but in programming as a whole and didn't that only not make me know what to focus on, but also now I stopped feeling enthusiastic whenever somebody starts to say learn x I just feel ...tired exhausted and the worst part is that I like writing code I just have no goal no big grand goal.\n\nAnd keep in mind when I started to try to get better at python I chose to choose another language and kept bouncing between languages so that made my progress decrease a lot and probably was one of the biggest reasons is why I don't want to learn its because I just want to code.\n\nI am just here to whine if you want to help somehow do so I won't stop you and thanks, but I just did this because no one in my family could understand what I am saying so I decided to say it to people who will understand what I am talking about.\n\nif you have passed through this please help\n\nthanks for hearing me ramble for this long.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Disclaimer: I still consider myself \"new\" to programming. I'm not an expert by any means. I just want to share my story.\n\nEver since I started listening to discussions surrounding memory management, I've had a growing interest in C/C++. Several months ago, I began studying open source C++ repositories and trying to put together all the pieces of a mostly complete program. \n\nIt was a disaster, honestly. I quickly came to realize that my first impression of programming was overly simplistic and due for a refactor. I depended on the verbose nature of Java more than I thought I did. I took for granted all the things the Java Virtual Machine handled automatically until I was introduced to header files and Cmake. I'd argue this is one of the most important recognitions I've made about programming in general so far. It made me focus more on compiler behavior, pre-compile tasks, and all the madness going on in the terminal rather than just how good I can code, follow exception messages or solve surface level problems.\n\nMy advice for new learners of C or C++: \n\n1. Be very patient with it. Take extended breaks (burnout can occur quickly)\n\n2. The coding part will mostly be simple following a tutorial. It's everything else regarding the compiler tasks, headers, proper linking, and so on that will be troubling because it's not common for Java programmers to deal with that.\n\n3. Reading code others wrote in C++ will be madness, but it is necessary for learning. Stay resilient. You'll eventually start following the logic more easily.\n\n4. There are several C/C++ compilers out there. make sure you're choosing the one the project you're looking at expects. It's been an unexpected sticking point for me. People say the compiler won't make any meaningful difference in performance, which can be mistaken as saying the compiler choice doesn't matter at all. It will matter, just not for performance.\n\n5. Cmake is a friend, not a foe. Follow its instructions and download the CMake UI so you can see all the missing data at once. It'll mostly be seen in large projects.\n\n6. Building a project is less about the code itself and more about file linking. Pointing the compiler to all associated files is top priority to learn (in my opinion)\n\n7. C/C++ makes no assumptions about your platform. That's more significant than I first imagined. It's another thing the JVM handles under the hood\n\nIf I am misguided about any of this, please let me know. Drop some stories in the comments about your learning experience as well and I'll happily read them",

But on the other hand, I absolutely dislike frontend development and UI/UX design.\n\nThe problem is, I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t have a clear path. I enjoy several things but haven’t gone deep into any of them.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n\\-What would you recommend I do next?\n\n\\-Should I focus on one language?Is there a particular field I should explore based on my interests?\n\n\\-How did you personally figure out what direction to take in your programming journey?\n\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I also have a new appreciation for pointers. In fact, I’ve thought of C as a ‘low level’ language, but this makes you realize how much that language is doing for you under the hood.\n\nBasically: you start with a simple NAND logic gate and build your way up to making a functioning (Turing complete) computer. The content is all free, but you have to pay for the autograder + certificate, which is totally not necessary. \n\nI don’t know that I’d recommend this as an intro course for someone who’s never programmed, though you don’t technically need any programming knowledge. And I don’t know that I’d really recommend it if your number one goal is just to get a job. But if you actually want to improve as a programming, having a general understanding of these underlying systems will really really help.\n\nI don’t have any association with the course or anything, like I said, I think it’s probably a decade old (or more) at this point.

I do not care; I just want a smooth implementation of my ideas.\n\nI am currently using a Linux VM on my windows pc to learn. I like the simplicity of it, the separation from my main files(in some manner) and all the bash stuff. I have two monitors. One I dedicate to the tutorials(windows side, because the VM runs videos and other things slowly) and the other I dedicate to all my practice and coding and all that. This has worked well for me so far, but I would like to know if this will cause me issues in the future.\n\nAll my writing files for this project are in google docs or libreoffice, the former because I tend to write on a laptop away from home and need a way to keep it synced. Most of my non-coding development for this project happens on windows, as well as other things like browsing or playing games. \n\nMy question is this: should I plan to scoot over to Linux permanently at some point? Should I dual boot? Should I plan to transfer my knowledge to Windows after this course is finished(Odin project, of course)? Should I dual boot? \n\nIf the answer to these are “personal preference” I am completely okay with that. I am just seeking guidance, know the pros and cons for my situation, and I do not need Linux for the purpose of being marketable for companies(which is what people mention whenever this question comes up online, for good reason.)",

So I'm not sure if I go with the higher difficulty lang or higher skill-floor projects? Secondly, I'm on an absolute poopoo of a laptop :D it's this old thinkpad I'm going to strip and put linux on. It has an SSD but is an old i3 (dual-core 2.1GHz Intel Core i3-2310M CPU) from like 12 years ago or whatever (thinkpad x220i aww yeah) so there will be some hardware limitations.

I'm learning C# through that course right now and I love it. I'm not good at programming, I'm very new to it, however programming and gaming are the only two things I can just lose time on. When I'm working on programming something I can just completely focus and zone in, and straight code for like nine hours, (I haven't tried any longer than that as of now). \n\n\n\nNext year I plan to go to university and study computer science (Don't worry I only plan on using that degree to get a cybersecurity job as it's the closest thing to a cybersec qualification where I live, also compsci is not oversaturated where I live unlike in America.) \n\n\n\nOverall I'm quite interested in cybersecurity and programming, and would like to get a career relating to one of those some day. So that's my career plan but right now I'm just wondering what should I learn? I have literally zero idea. I'm already learning C# but would love to learn more, and it would drive me if they had a specific use that I could use, because to be quite frank I don't want to learn a language that'll be useless to me.",

I'm here to ask for some tips and advices for both personal and carrier growth. \n\nSome years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it.  I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware,  and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. \n\nSo, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). \n\nBut in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. \n\nNow, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.\n\nThat said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:\n\n1)where should I start?\n2)what should I prioritize? \n3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.\n\nI know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now. The moment in your life when you realize you know enough to be where you are, but not enough to go much further. \n\nThanks for your time ",

        "content": "First of all I'll give some context:\n\nWebsite is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like \"serving\" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).\n\nFast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)\n\nSo what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:\n1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since \"AI slop\")\n2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.\n\nFirst approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thing\n\nWhich one do you think I should work on? And if there's something you'd like to add, please tell me.\n\nPS: I'm more of a machine learning kind of guy and not frontend and all",

        "content": "I’ve been a programmer for most of my life. I started with PHP, which I worked with for around 10 years.\n\nEventually, I wanted to level up. I began reading more and more about design patterns and techniques like generics and other advanced concepts. When the opportunity came along, I made the switch to Go. However, I never quite got used to the syntax—it felt a bit old-school, with very short and cryptic naming conventions. After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.\n\nUnfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.\n\nSince I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn’t reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.\n\nFor the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.\n\nI started doubting if it wasn’t time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. \n\nI expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.\n\nNow more then 2 years further I’m willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.\n\nBut i don’t want to do course after course. I’m also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.\n\nThe main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I’m not ready to pick it up again.\n\nI wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job. I do want to get back into software development eventually.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Modern programming languages, especially dynamic languages have a really good thing going for them which is there is a library for pretty much everything you want to do which is wrapper that makes it easy for you to do the thing without ever having to understand the core architecture of how something is happening.\n\nFor example, talking about JS env: Need servers? Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.\n\nThis makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.\n\nIn my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.\n\nNow, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nI also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.\n\nBut, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.\n\nIf I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nLike because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.\n\nOn the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.\n\nSo, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.\n\nWith this, what do you suggest:\n\n- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.\n- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.\n- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",

If you have to explain something technically, then generally it is ok. But if you have to explain something technical to a non-technical person, it is a bit harder.   \n2. Talking in stand-ups is generally fine, but sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every time.   \n3. Asking questions and knowing when to ask questions is difficult.   \n4. Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on.  \n5. Humour is always a problem (in my opinion, it is not just a language thing but a cultural thing)  \n6. General conversations are sometimes the hardest to follow.   \n7. Phrasal verbs (phrasal verbs are everywhere with native speakers)  \n8. Giving feedback, how direct is too direct or was I too indirect? \n\nSo... those are some of my observations.

I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). \n\nAt first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying \"stonks go up\". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment.  And in that there is peace. \n\nBut I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. \n\nA couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you’ll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.\n\nHow the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?\n\nI've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: \n\n* **Front-end** / **Web Design** \\- S.O.L\n* **Full-stack** \\- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset\n* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up\n* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \\- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand\n* **MLE / MLOps** \\- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don’t have a stats/ML background\n* **Blockchain** \\- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch \n* **Data Science / ML** \\- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats \n\nExploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. \n\nI'm also considering a master’s to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. \n\nSo my question is this. \n\nWhat path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master’s a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking? \n\nAny advice would be mucho appreciated, thanks!",

A project that is specific/applicable to a specific domain, such as an anti-money laundering detection project within banking, or fraud detection within a commercial website/ banking\n7.

Not because its gonna put programmers out of a job, but when they encounter an error no doubt they will ask the ai to fix the issue. Eventually its gonna be a codebase that no one understands or can fix. It's emboldening people to create things they don't understand. Go to some of the ai subreddits and you'll see \"addicted to getting things done\", \"improved productivity\" everywhere. I like to use ai as an assistant but some of the posts I read straight up saying they have 0 knowledge and the ai did all the work of 8 months in 72 hours... what are your thoughts on this situation? (I wrote ai but maybe more accurate to say LLM). Vibe coding and vibe coders were a joke but from their own experiences it seems like they are \"getting things done\". Idk maybe I'm behind and instead of learning and programming I should be vibe coding?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm new to programming and drawn to the field because I'm fascinated by how programmers can envision ideas and bring them to life through code. However, I'm struggling with two main challenges that are holding me back.\n\nFirst, I'm having trouble with the fundamentals of problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks. Despite watching tutorials, reading forums, and attempting LeetCode problems, everything feels overwhelming. I suspect I need to start even more basic than most beginners - perhaps at what I'd call a \"level -1.\" To address this, I'm planning to work with a tutor who can help me build a solid foundation before I try to learn independently.\n\nSecond, I'm unsure about which programming specialization to pursue. This uncertainty stems partly from my lack of confidence, but I now understand that working on personal projects is crucial for growth. Previously, I relied solely on LeetCode and books like \"How to Think Like a Programmer\" by Anton Spraul, but this community has shown me these should only supplement hands-on practice, not replace it.\n\nMy main question is: Can I develop core programming skills that would transfer to any specialization I eventually choose - whether that's web development, DevOps, cloud engineering, or something else? Would it be better to pick a beginner-friendly area like web development to start with, or are there specific foundational projects and practices that would serve me well regardless of my eventual path?\n\nI'm open to any guidance you can offer, and I plan to utilize resources like tutoring, online communities, and Discord servers to support my learning journey.",

        "content": "I feel lost. For context, I am a computer science student in my third semester of my second year. I will be graduating next year with my Thesis and OJT (Internship) coming up in my second and third semester. My college's CS program is really fast-paced so its hard to keep up. I swapped to fully-online a year ago because I thought that would help me focus with my studies as well as save money for commute (I live 2 hours away from my college and that burnt me out). Fast forward a year later, I haven't progressed at all. I have just been skimming through lessons and haven't really learned much. I already forgot about the concepts and languages taught to us months ago such as Java and Data Structures. I even failed one of my classes because of my negligence towards my studies. I feel like I wasted 2 years of my college life.\n\nMy personal interest is web development. I started learning it 2 years ago (January 2023) although at a really slow pace. I don't have any knowledge of it beyond the basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript stack. I am still trying to learn and get good at it to this day even if I'm inconsistent. I have done a few projects with the help of AI and tutorials but they are not that complex. If you ask me to sit down and create something from scratch, I would not be able to make it without the help of AI, which I also relied on for most of my school work. I just pass my requirements instead of actually studying the materials. I feel behind my peers and feel like I should have done or learned these things years ago.\n\nMost of all, I am afraid of what comes after I graduate or what I'll even do with my Thesis and Internship. I haven't started on my portfolio yet. I am not familiar with how the tech job market in my country (Philippines) work. I don't know anyone who works in the industry. I would like to start-off as a web developer but from what I've heard, it's not that in demand anymore.\n\nI know its a lot to unpack and it may seem like I'm asking for validation here, but I really want to know what I need to focus on and what to look for.",

        "content": "Landed a job at Meta earlier this year (got lucky with timing before the Feb 10 layoffs lol).\n\n**Job summary:**\n```\nPosition: Mid-Level Software Engineer L4\nTC: $350k (193 base, 29 bonus, 128 stock/year)\nYOE: 2.5 years\n```\n\n**The interview process:**\n* Phone screen: 2 leetcode problems in 45 mins\n* Final: 2 leetcode rounds (same format as phone screen) + 1 behavioral round + 1 system design round\n* Total Time: 5 hours\n\nFrom initial contact to offer signing took 2 months.\n\n**The framework that worked:**\n\nWith 2 problems in 45 minutes, you really only get 22 minutes per problem. Here is how I would break it down.\n\n1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \\- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.\n2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \\- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.\n3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \\- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.\n4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \\- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.\n\n**How I prepared:**\n\n* Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.\n* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.\n\nI know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off! I was looking for a job for 9 months until I got this opportunity lmao. Ask me anything!\n\n**Soft Plug:**\n\nBuilding a [website](https://chenaaron3.github.io/drawcode/) to visualize code!

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m really terrible at Reddit formatting, so this will probably seem like a blob of text. \n\nSo many people are incorrectly saying that AI is the driving reason for the mass layoffs, non-hiring, and the downward trend of anything software development related. \n\nAI is a _contributing_ factor to the *difficulty* of getting hired at entry level positions at companies, but that’s a standard bar push. \n\nBut what’s *truly* influencing the mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and shrinking investment into developing proprietary and innovative technologies in America isn’t AI. \n\nIt’s a tax credit rewrite that was never supposed to take effect. \n\nLaw and legislation is boring, but this piece specifically, is important for all of you. It impacts your life, your industry, how you’re paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you’re planning to start or work in a startup.\n\nI’m going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. \n\nThe credit I’m talking about:\n\nThe Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. \n\nEDIT: Edits will be for formatting. \n\nThe law that changed it:\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). \n\n\n\nThis provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. \n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives vote:\n\n227 Republicans For\n\n13 Republicans Against\n\n\n\n0 Democrats For\n\n192 Democrats Against\n\n\n\nThe Senate vote:\n\n51 Republicans For\n\n0 Republicans Against\n\n\n\n0 Democrats For\n\n47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against \n\n\n\nThe final result:\n\nSigned into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. \n\n\n\nDate it took effect:\n\nJanuary 1, 2022\n\n\n\nWhy so late?\n\nA fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. \n\n\n\nIn short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn’t provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. \n\n\n\nThey assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn’t. \n\n\n\nPrevious:\n\n\n\nPrior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals’ salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. \n\n\n\nAfter 2022:\nAll of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. \n\n\n\nFor domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. \n\n\n\nFor foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. \n\n\n\nMeaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. \n\n\n\nNow, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.\n\n\n\nWhich resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. \n\n\n\nBUT! There is a bipartisan bill that’s going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we’ll see where it goes!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.\n\nWhy SWE is the best:\n\n* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.\n* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager \"Hey I'll be away this afternoon\" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.\n* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.\n* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.\n* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.\n* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.\n* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.\n\nSo yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Feel free to add your own points as I'm sure I missed a ton of things.",

        "author": "nysoxfan01",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI.  The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated.  Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job search\n\nAs a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds.  I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that.  But I have also never been unemployed.  This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman).  And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market.  If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.\n\nWith that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:\n\n**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.**  \nYour goal is to reduce competition as much as possible.  When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio.  You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist.  A lot of them have barely any applicants.  If they are desperate enough they will hire you.  Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away\n\n**2. Make sure your resume is concise.**  \nWhen I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing.  Don't dilute your resume with crap.  Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work.  Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did.  Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points.  I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on.  It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.\n\n**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise**  \nIf you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things.  Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to.  Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React.  Then do the same thing with Angular etc.\n\n**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS**  \nYou need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive.  You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work.  This is especially crucial for internships.  My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup.  Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people.  Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.\n\n**5. Just straight up fucking lie**  \nI don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response.  We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer.  But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role.  I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer.  So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product.  Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer\n\n**6.  Same as number 5**  \nThis is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid.  If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience.  Same with Java and C# etc.  The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff.  It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language.  At the end of the day you need a job\n\n**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**  \nWhen I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed.  So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release.  I didn't get this job.  The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line.  I did get this job.  You get the idea\n\n**8. Do not negotiate**  \nThere's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating.  But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market.  Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage.  Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over.  I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer\n\n**9: For students: do not waste your time**  \nSeriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can.  Grades hardly matter.  I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0.  It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job.  He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off.  Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time.  Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge\n\n**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed**  \nKeep your resume up to date with your latest experience.  Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so.  I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next.  You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",

        "content": "I joined a startup about a year ago, fresh out of grad school. I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.\n\n\nA little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be \"AI first\". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, \"Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast\".\nWe are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the \"AI way\". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.\n\nThe worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.\n\nI chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, \"Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document\".\n\nMy work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus. My passion for coding and building robust systems is fading. It feels like my actual engineering skills are being devalued in favor of someone who can just prompt an AI for a passable solution to everything.\n\nIs this what the future of tech work looks like? Are other companies operating this way?\n",

I’m a mid-level developer, and unfortunately most of my workforce are seniors so basically I’m in the chopping block and one of the first to leave if layoffs happen.\n\nI’m torn.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.\n\nTotally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I’ve seen from job seekers who’ve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:\n\n\n\n**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**\n\nDon’t overthink it. You’re not asking for a job. You’re just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person’s position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they’re happy to help.\n\nYou can say something like, “Hi \\[name\\], I’m currently studying \\[major\\] and exploring career paths in \\[field\\]. If you’d like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I’d love to hear about your experiences.”\n\n\n\n**2. Build rapport: \\~2 min**\n\nDon’t jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:\n\n“How are you doing today?”\n\n“Hope you’re having a great week, thank you for your time!”\n\nIt’s a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.\n\n\n\n**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**\n\nKeep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.\n\n“I’m currently a Data Analytics student at \\[school\\] and I’m really interested in marketing analytics. I’ve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I’d love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.”\n\nConfidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you’ll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.\n\n\n\n**4. Ask two good questions: \\~10 min**\n\nThis is where you learn. Try:\n\n“What do you like most (and least) about your job?”\n\n“How did you get into this field?”\n\n“If you graduated today, what would you focus on?”\n\nAvoid asking generic questions like “How is your company?” Just try to show curiosity and depth.\n\n\n\n**5. Follow up consistently**\n\nSend a quick thank you note and ask if they’d like to stay in touch. That’s it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.\n\n\n\n**Tips:**\n\n\\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They’re often more responsive than FAANG executives.\n\n\\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\n\n\\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.\n\nSo if you’re afraid of networking, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Take the first step and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else networked their way into your first job? How did you succeed?",

But he didn’t give me a lot of them and mostly told me to help out with documentation, which I didn’t mind that much because after all it is necessary.

I know a little bit of Java as well but most of my day to day activities is writing terraform on edit yaml files for CNCF projects and building pipelines. For a cloud engineer historically it was better to learn golang because most of the CNCF projects and terraform were written in go. I want to do more backend development and systems level programming and maybe Iot development.\n\nHowever I’ve heard rust is growing rapidly and might replace go. In 2025 is it better to learn go or rust for backend/cloud engineering. Ideally I want to learn both and probably will eventually but I am time limited for the moment and can only learn in the near term.",

        "content": "When I graduated in 2023, I applied for a backend Java role. My resume was about SpringBoot projects. One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.\n\nHowever, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.\n\nFor your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.\n\nThe technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.\n\nAnd this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.\n\nHaving stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.\n\nStill, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.\n\nI think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now. I wonder how you view my situation, and I would appreciate it if you have suggestions for me.",

It's helpful for writing simple tests or creating simple utilities and classes but the moment things get really complex it just end up in loops and it never achieves what I want. Most of the time it gets to the point where I need to split up the task into super tiny granular prompts and at that point it's just faster for me to do the job myself.\n\nAre there people here who work in big codebases that find it helpful aside from writing simple tests and utilities? What I mean is building full fledged features by vibe coding. My company is really pushing us to build features purely by writing prompts and even though I want it to work it's just unproductive if I have to write extremely granular prompts.",

        "content": "Hey all! A few years ago, when the employment market shifted with COVID, I landed a great, well-salaried remote software engineering job. With the added flexibility, my wife and I decided to move back to our hometown and bought a house.\n\nIt's been about four years now, and I think I'm realizing I'm tired of the isolation it creates in my life. Not only do I feel siloed at work and a bit excluded from upward movement, but I'm also realizing I don't quite fit into my hometown's social fabric as I'd assumed, especially with my job being so different from the local trades.\n\nI'm realizing I want to work in person again. I miss the daily camaraderie with other engineers, the energy of a stricter schedule, and even the minor corporate politics that somehow keep everyone alert. Remote work has made me a bit lax, and while I still deliver good work, I'm not sure I like this more relaxed pace.\n\nI could always move a couple of hours back to my old metro area, but it's still fairly small. I'm interested in trying a larger city with more tech companies and less friction in the job market (not implying it's easier to get a job, just more options).\n\nHowever, having bought a house, moving is a bit more complex and expenses are now quite a bit higher. It's not as easy to pick up and move as when I was renting and had less stuff. I'm curious if any of you have gone through something similar and would have any tips. Did you use a new job to manage a relocation, or did you make it work without having to move jobs? Any tips, regrets, or expectations that either held true or were broken? I'm eager to hear about others' experiences.\n\nEDIT: Most comments received have been about cost of living. I'm very financially aware that moving somewhere more populated correlates with an increase in housing cost. I'm more interested in experiences others have had; please don't suggest I'm naive and that if I only looked at the numbers harder, I'd realize I'm crazy for wanting to do what I've outlined above. I'm not. It's truly a case of suffocating from the isolation of remote work and a small town; an increase in cost of living is something I can afford and would happily do so if it helps me feel more integrated with other people around me.",

I know I can fast track my degree by showing my competence, I just want to know if it'll be a waste of my time since I've wasted my time educating myself for dead end jobs before.",

I previously worked in sales, and decided I needed to pivot (to a field I was passionate about) about two years ago. Worked pretty hard to learn programming, got a BSCS at WGU (bleh, I know) and here I am. \n\nThe tech stack is mostly a mix of very old Java applications and some newer React stuff. Seems like devs are kind of doing it all - front end, back end, testing, you name it! It's fun and I've been exposed to a lot off cool technologies. I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. \n\nI'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition. I'm worried that I'm not gaining experience on new and cool tech stacks, I'm worried about the no code app conversions. I want to grow, and level up my income. \n\nWhat are some things I should be doing to make the most of this opportunity?",

Unfortunately, there’s no team match available in my region at the moment. The recruiter mentioned they’re actively reaching out to hiring managers and will update me if anything comes up in the next six months.\n\nThis is my first time going through this kind of situation. Are there any ways I can improve my chances of getting a team match or speed up the process? How likely is it to get matched within this window?\n\nAdditionally, I have a few questions:\n\n1. I initially gave a salary expectation in the 50th–75th percentile for L4 (based on levels.fyi). Would it help to tell the recruiter I’m open to less, as I care more about the opportunity to grow at AWS than compensation?\n2. I’ve seen suggestions to regularly follow up with the recruiter. Is weekly follow-up too frequent? Should I reach out by phone or email? Should I inform them if I see newly opened roles that interest me?\n3. Is there any way to get in touch with hiring managers directly to advocate for myself?\n\nAny insights or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.\n\nI currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.\n\nI just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great. I feel lost :/ any advice would be really helpful <3 Thank you!\n\nI couldn't post in /frontend for some reason :/ so I'm hoping for some advice here if thats okay ",

After working in my current company for a while and being exposed to some applied research, I think that I want to do research for a living. I want to do a PhD in CV but a lack of published papers makes me think that doing a RAship / pre-doc fellowship in computer vision would strengthen my cause. Would really like to understand that -   \n1. Since transitioning from corporate to research directly is uncommon, would applying to RAships/pre-doc fellowships in US/Europe be an unrealistic goal?  \n2. Do any universities entertain online commitments for RAships?  \n3. Do universities allow non-masters/PhD students to do research under the profs/PhD students working there? Can't go for masters due to financial constraints.\n\nWould really love to hear the experiences of people who have transitioned from corporate to research. **Posting this question here as I think that this would help the community in general as a lot of the members might be in the same predicament**.",

        "content": "#Hey guys, I’m posting for a friend who doesn’t have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you\n \nI’m currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems.\n  \nTo pursue this, I’m considering enrolling in a Master’s in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics.\n  \nThat said, I’m wondering if a single Philosophy master’s is the most efficient path—or if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master’s in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I’m genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I’m well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains.\n  \nMy key questions are: \n \n* Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master’s degree (or two) be sufficient?\n* Would pursuing two Master’s degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?\n* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?\n* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs?\n  \nThank you so much for your time and any advice you can share—I deeply appreciate it.",

I do have experience with a lot of tools/frameworks like AWS but like i said no certification.\nAlso based in Europe.\n\nI recently went on interview at a few companies and most of them asked for certifications. Both for consultancy and not. Even though I managed to give them a detailed explanation of things, they kept asking why i didnt pursue certifications.\n\nThe last few days I have been reading a lot of topics around this subject. And there doesnt seem to be a straightforward answer. Some say experience > certifications. Some say its a red flag if someone has a lot of certifications. And you have people that swear by certifications.\n\nNow Im a bit into my doubting phase. Whats true and whats not? In the last two months I have been focussing on certifications, managed to get two, and at the end of this year I hope to get another three. The two were rather easy since i have had experience with them for years. Is this also a red flag? If someone gets a lot of certifications in a year?\nBecause now im doubting myself.\n\nWhat are your experiences on this topic?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I'm a new grad torn between two offers. One is SRE at a company that is mid-sized, tech/AI oriented, enterprise, good recent funding, seems really stable, GlassDoor reviews seem positive, unlimited PTO (that reviews say was usually approved), has good benefits but would require relocating. Another is SWE at a smaller start-up ish, can't find any info online about their revenue and funding, almost no GlassDoor reviews, no unlimited PTO, 7 year old e-commerce company.\n\nSalary wise due to relocating they both kind of wind up being the same net for me.\n\nMy brother who's worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft for a few years (but never worked in SWE) is telling me that the smaller company SWE position w slightly worse benefits is much better because the industry is so competitive right now that if you only have experience as an SRE it'll be hard to pivot to other roles in the future, and that it's a much better setup for my future career than an SRE role. He also said that it's better to work at a e-commerce marketplace company because the skills will be more transferrable and a lot of FAANG type companies will like that, whereas the enterprise AI company experience wouldn't be as direct.\n\nAnother engineer I talked to said the job titles don't matter that much, I'll only be able to tell once I start the job and know exactly what I'm doing that I'll know how useful the learned skills are, best I can do is look at the job description.\n\nSo I'm torn on what to do. If the job titles were the same I'd go with the mid-sized company 100%. But since the smaller company where I'm not sure about the work culture has the better title *and* doesn't require me to relocate I'm really not sure. Any advice on what it seems like the better role is, if SWE is that much better as my brother says it is? Idk I feel like the SRE position is at a company with such a stronger future. \n\nIf it helps, the SWE role works with C#, they said I'll be doing some QA and automation with Selenium. The SRE role will be working with Playwright and Kubernetes. I have no idea which of those skills would be more useful in the industry and neither does my brother/other engineer friend lol.",

I currently work with 5–6 US-based companies (mostly SaaS and tech) and have long-term relationships with most of them. This setup allows me to earn a great income and gives me a lot of freedom. It's also pretty low-risk, since I'm not dependent on a single client.\n\nOne of my clients — a growing fintech startup — is pushing hard to bring me on full-time. They’ve interviewed other candidates but seem set on me. They’re offering a high-paying contract (contractor status, not employed) that would exceed my current income slightly.\n\nI’m torn for a few reasons:\n\n* I really enjoy the freedom of freelancing — no need to ask for time off, minimal meetings, full control of my schedule.\n* But I also deal with a lot of context switching, which is mentally exhausting. Part of me dreams of focusing on one product.\n* Going full-time would mean dropping other clients, which puts me in a more vulnerable position if things don’t work out.\n\nHas anyone here gone from freelancing to a full-time role (especially as a contractor)? What was your experience like? Any regrets, or did it feel like the right call?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts!",
