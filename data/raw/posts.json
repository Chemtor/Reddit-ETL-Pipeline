Otherwise, companies are just benching you or don’t care. I used to chase on 4th day for a response, if I don’t hear back, I never chased.\n5) Speed : Apply to jobs posted within a week and move faster in the process. Candidates who move fast have high chances to get job. Remember, if someone takes inter view before you and are a good fit, they will get the job doesn’t matter how good you are . \n6) Just learn new tools and did some projects, and you are good to go with that technology.\n\nBest of Luck to Everyone!!!! \n",

Performance/Cost? (Pre-aggregating data to make queries faster and cheaper).\n2. Simplicity/Self-Service? (Creating simple, wide tables so non-technical users can build dashboards without complex joins).\n3. Governance/Consistency?

We, the data engineers that doing the migration do not have any permission to see the production data. Hence for development, we rely on sandbox env of the SaaS app that filled with dummy data and just hope it will works in production. If there are any problem in prod migration? we need to get approval from security team, and then need to sit down with the data owner and then fix it there. ",

        "content": "I recently put together a hands-on walkthrough showing how you can spin up your own open data lakehouse locally using open-source tools like presto and Iceberg. My goal was to keep things simple, reproducible, and easy to test.\n\nTo make it easier, along with the config files and commands, I have added a clear step-by-step video guide that takes you from running containers to configuring the environment and querying Iceberg tables with Presto.\n\nOne thing that stood out during the setup was that it was fast and cheap. I went with a small dataset here for the demo, but you can push limits and create your own benchmarks to test how the system performs under real conditions.\n\nAnd while the guide uses MySQL as the starting point, it’s flexible you can just as easily plug in Postgres or other sources.\n\nIf you’ve been trying to build a lakehouse stack yourself something that’s open source and not too inclined towards one vendor this guide can give you a good start.\n\nCheck out the blog and let me know if you’d like me to dive deeper into this by testing out different query engines in a detailed series, or if I should share my benchmarks in a later thread. If you have any benchmarks to share with Presto/Iceberg, do share them as well.\n\n**Tech stack used – Presto, Iceberg**, **MinIO, OLake**\n\n",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "The idea of a \"Database OS\" has been a sort of holy grail for decades, but it's making a huge comeback for a very modern reason.\n\nMy colleagues and I just had a paper on this exact topic accepted to SIGMOD 2025. I can share our perspective.\n\n**TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you might think. We're not replacing Linux. We're giving the database a safe, hardware-assisted \"kernel mode\" of its own, inside a normal Linux process.**\n\n# The Problem: The OS is the New Slow Disk\n\nFor years, the motto was \"CPU waits for I/O.\" But with NVMe SSDs hitting millions of IOPS and microsecond latencies, the bottleneck has shifted. Now, very often, the **CPU is waiting for the OS**.\n\nThe Linux kernel is a marvel of general-purpose engineering. But that \"general-purpose\" nature comes with costs: layers of abstraction, context switches, complex locking, and safety checks. For a high-performance database, these are pure overhead.\n\nDatabase devs have been fighting this for years with heroic efforts:\n\n* Building their own buffer pools to bypass the kernel's page cache.\n* Using io\\_uring to minimize system calls.\n\nBut these are workarounds. We're still fundamentally \"begging\" the OS for permission. We can't touch the real levers of power: direct page table manipulation, interrupt handling, or privileged instructions.\n\n# The Two \"Dead End\" Solutions\n\nThis leaves us with two bad choices:\n\n1. **\"Just patch the Linux kernel.\"** This is a nightmare. You're performing surgery on a 30-million-line codebase that's constantly changing. It's incredibly risky (remember the recent CrowdStrike outage?), and you're now stuck maintaining a custom fork forever.\n2. **\"Build a new OS from scratch (a Unikernel).\"** The idealistic approach. But in reality, you're throwing away 30+ years of the Linux ecosystem: drivers, debuggers (gdb), profilers (perf), monitoring tools, and an entire world of operational knowledge. No serious production database can afford this.\n\n# Our \"Third Way\": Virtualization for Empowerment, Not Just Isolation\n\nHere's our breakthrough, inspired by the classic [Dune paper (OSDI '12)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fconference%2Fosdi12%2Ftechnical-sessions%2Fpresentation%2Fbelay). We realized that hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x) can be used for more than just running VMs. They can be used to **grant a single process temporary, hardware-sandboxed kernel privileges.**\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* Your database starts as a normal Linux process.\n* When it needs to do something performance-critical (like manage its buffer pool), it executes a special instruction and \"enters\" a guest mode.\n* In this mode, it becomes its own mini-kernel. It has its own page table, can handle certain interrupts, and can execute privileged instructions—all with hardware-enforced protection. If it screws up, it only crashes itself, not the host system.\n* When it needs to do something generic, like send a network packet, it \"exits\" and hands the request back to the host Linux kernel to handle.\n\nThis gives us the best of both worlds:\n\n* **Total Control:** We can re-design core OS mechanisms specifically for the database's needs.\n* **Full Linux Ecosystem:** We're still running on a standard Linux kernel, so we lose nothing. All the tools, drivers, and libraries still work.\n* **Hardware-Guaranteed Safety:** Our \"guest kernel\" is fully isolated from the host.\n\n# Two Quick, Concrete Examples from Our Paper\n\nThis new freedom lets us do things that were previously impossible in userspace:\n\n1. **Blazing Fast Snapshots (vs. fork()):** Linux's fork() is slow for large processes because it has to copy page tables and set up copy-on-write with reference counting for every single shared memory page. In our guest kernel, we designed a simple, epoch-based mechanism that ditches per-page reference counting entirely. **Result: We can create a snapshot of a massive buffer pool in milliseconds.**\n2. **Smarter Buffer Pool (vs. mmap):** A big reason database devs hate mmap is that evicting a page requires unmapping it, which can trigger a \"TLB Shootdown.\" This is an expensive operation that interrupts every other CPU core on the machine to tell them to flush that memory address from their translation caches. It's a performance killer. In our guest kernel, the database can directly manipulate its own page tables and use the INVLPG instruction to **flush the TLB of only the local core**. Or, even better, we can just leave the mapping and handle it lazily, eliminating the shootdown entirely.\n\nSo, to answer your question: a full-blown \"Database OS\" that replaces Linux is probably not practical. But a **co-designed system where the database runs its own privileged kernel code in a hardware-enforced sandbox** is not only possible but also extremely powerful.\n\nWe call this paradigm \"Privileged Kernel Bypass.\"\n\nIf you're interested, you can check out the work here:\n\n* **Paper:** Zhou, Xinjing, et al. \"Practical db-os co-design with privileged kernel bypass.\" SIGMOD (2025). (I'll add the link once it's officially in the ACM Digital Library, but you can find a preprint if you search for the title).\n* **Open-Source Code:** [https://github.com/zxjcarrot/libdbos](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzxjcarrot%2Flibdbos)\n\nHappy to answer any more questions",

Things like rotating proxies, handling CAPTCHAs, and managing schema changes become painful really quickly.\n\nI came across hyperbrowser while looking into different approaches, and it made me wonder if there’s actually a “clean” way to treat scraping like a proper data pipeline, similar to how we handle ETL in more traditional contexts.\n\nDo you usually integrate scraped data directly into your data warehouse or lake, or do you keep it separate first? How do you personally deal with sites that keep changing layouts so you don’t end up rewriting extractors every other week? And at what point do you just say it’s easier to buy the data instead of maintaining the scrapers?\n",

My question really is, coming from just a basic data analytics background, how long do you think it would take to get to a point of proficiency across the whole pipeline/stack?  \n  \nFor context I'm kind of in an odd spot where I've joined a new company working as an 'automation engineer' where the company is quite tech immature and old fashioned and has kinda placed me in a new role to help automate a lot of processes with an understanding that this could take a while to allow for discovery, building POCs, getting approval for things etc. Coming from a data background I'm viewing it as a \"they need data engineering but just don't know it yet\" type role with some IT and reporting thrown in and it's been going alright so far though they use some ancient, obscure or in-house tools and I feel it will probably stunt my career long term though it gives me lots of free time to learn on my own and autonomy to introduce new tools/practices.  \n  \nNow I've recently been approached for interviews externally though in a 'real' data engineer capacity using all the name brand tools dbt, Snowflake, AWS etc. I guess my question is how easy is it to start running assuming you finally get an offer made? I'd say from a technical standpoint I'm pretty damn good at SQL and have a strong understanding of the Tableau ecosystem and while I've used dbt a little, it's not my specialty, nor is working directly in a warehouse or using Python (I've accessed literally one API with it lol). It also seems like a really good company with a 10-20% raise from my current salary. I would say that I've had exposure along the whole pipeline and have a general understanding of modern data engineering but I would honestly be learning 80% of it on the job. Has anyone gone through something similar? I'd love to get the opportunity to take it but I wouldn't want to be facing super high expectations as soon as I arrive and not be able to get up and running a month or two in.",

I’ve been working as a Data Analyst for about a year, but I recently switched jobs and landed in a company that has zero data infrastructure or reporting. I was brought in to establish both sides: create an organized database (pulling together all the scattered Excel files) and then build out dashboards and reporting templates. To be fair, the reason I got this opportunity is less about being a seasoned data engineer and more about my analyst background + the fact that my boss liked my overall vibe/approach. That said, I’m honestly really hyped about the data engineering part — I see a ton of potential here both for personal growth and to build something properly from scratch (no legacy mess, no past bad decisions to clean up). The company isn’t huge (about 50 people), so the data volume isn’t crazy — probably tens to hundreds of GB — but it’s very dispersed across departments. Everything we use is Microsoft ecosystem. \n\nHere’s the approach I’ve been leaning toward (based on my reading so far): \n\nExcels uploaded to SharePoint → ingested into ADLS \n\nSet up bronze/silver/gold layers\n\nUse Azure Data Factory (or Synapse pipelines) to move/transform data \n\nUse Purview for governance/lineage/monitoring \n\nPublish reports via Power BI\n\nPossibly separate into dev/test/prod environments \n\nRegarding data management, I was thinking of keeping a OneNote Notebook or Sharepoint Site with most of the rules and documentation and a diagram.io where I document the relationships and all the fields.\n\nMy questions for you all: \n\nDoes this approach make sense for a company of this size, or am I overengineering it? \n\nIs this generally aligned with best practices?\n\nIn what order should I prioritize stuff?\n\nAny good Coursera (or similar) courses you’d recommend for someone in my shoes? (My company would probably cover it if I ask.) \n\nAm I too deep over my head? Appreciate any feedback, sanity checks, or resources you think might help.",

        "content": "I was hired as a “DE” almost a year ago. I absolutely love this job. It’s very laid back, I don’t really work with others very much, and I can (kinda) do whatever I want. There’s no sprints or agile stuff, I work on projects here and there, shifting my focus kinda haphazardly to whatever needs done. There’s just a couple problems.\n\n1. I make $19/hr. This is astronomically low, though what I’m doing isn’t all that hard.\n2. I don’t think my work is the same as the rest of the industry. I work with mostly whatever tools I want, but we don’t do any cloud stuff, I don’t really collaborate with anyone, there’s no code reviews or PRs or anything like that. My work mainly consists of “find x data source, setup a way to ingest it, do some transformations, and maybe load it into our DB if we want it.” I mostly do stuff with polars, duckdb, and sometimes pandas. I also do some random things on the side like web scraping/browser automation. We work with A LOT of data, so we have 2 beefy servers, but even then not working with the cloud is really odd to me (though we are a niche government contracted company).\n3. The restrictions are kinda insane. First of all, because we’re government contractors, we went from 2/5 work from home days to 5/5 in office days (thanks Trump). So that sucks, but also the software I can use is heavily restricted. We use company PCs, so I can’t download anything onto them, not even browser extensions. Many sites are blocked, and things move slowly. On the development side, only Python packages are allowed on an individual basis. Anything else needs to go through the admin team and takes awhile to get approved. I’ve found ways around this, but it’s not something I should be doing.\n\nSo, after working here for almost a year, is it time to look for other jobs? I don’t have a degree, but I’ve been programming since I was a kid with a lot of projects under my belt, and now this “professional” experience. Mostly I just want more money, and the commute is long, and working from home a bit would be nice. But honestly I just wanna make $60k a year for 5 years and I’ll be good. I don’t know what raises are like here, but I imagine not very good. What should I do?",

In addition, tables could be selectively refreshed based on calls to the XMLA endpoint in the PowerBi service. Last example, a script to scan a model’s underlying reports to determine which unused columns can be dropped.\n\nAnyone do something similar?

        "content": "Hi all, \n\n  \nFirst of all, i'm a beginner.\n\nCurrently, were using a low code tool for our transformations but planning to migrate to a SQL/python first solution. We're applying data vault although we sometimes abuse it as in that besides strict link, hub and sats, we throw bridge tables in the mix. One of the issues we currently see in our transformations is that links are dependent on keys/hashes of other objects (that's natural i would say). Most of the time, we fill the hash of the object in the same workflow as the corresponding id key column in the link table. Yet, this creates a soup of dependencies and doesn't feel that professional.\n\nThe main solution we're thinking off is to make use of a keychain. We would define all the keys of the objects on basis of the source tables (which we call layer 1 tables, i believe it would be called bronze right?).  and fill the keychain first before running any layer 2/silver transformations. This way, we would have a much clearer approach in handling keys without making it a jungle of dependencies. I was wondering what you guys do or what best practices are?\n\nThanks.",

They’re all pretty similar, and I’m planning to manage them in a config-driven way, so that part is fine. The tricky bit is that all of them need to be upserts.\n\nIn my last job I used SparkKubernetesOperator, and since there weren’t that many jobs, I just wrote to staging tables and then used MERGE in Redshift or ON CONFLICT in Postgres. Here though, the DB team doesn’t want to deal with 400 staging tables (and honestly I agree it sounds messy).\n\nSpark doesn’t really have native upsert support. Most of my data is inserts, only a small fraction is updates (I can catch them with an updated_at field). One idea is: do the inserts with Spark, then handle the updates separately with psycopg2.

I would like to get more opinions.   \n\nI have created a pipeline using Airflow which will process social media profiles. I need to update their data and insert new content (videos/images) into our database.\n\nI will test it to see if it handles the desired load but it will cost money to host and pay the external data providers so I want to get a second opinion on my implementation.\n\nI have to run to run the pipeline periodically and process a lot of profiles;\n1. Daily: 171K profiles\n2. Two Weeks: 307K profiles\n3. One Month: 1M profiles\n4. Three Months: 239K profiles\n5. Six Months: 506K profiles\n6. Twelve Months: 400K profiles\n\nThese are the initial numbers. They will be increased gradually over the next year so I will have time and a team to work on scaling the pipeline. The daily profiles have to be completed the same day. The rest can take longer to complete. \n\nI have split the pipeline into 3 DAGs. I am using hooks/operators for S3, SQS and postgres. I am also using asyncio with aiohttp for storing multiple content on s3. \n\n## DAG 1 (Dispatch)\n- Runs on a fixed schedule\n- fetches data from database based on the provided filters.   \n- Splits data into individual rows, one row per creator using `.expand`. \n- Use dynamic task mapping with TriggerDagRunOperator to create a DAG to process each profile separately. \n- I also set the task_concurrency to limit parallel task executions. \n\n## DAG 2 (Process)\n- Triggered by DAG 1\n- Get params from the first DAG\n- Fetches the required data from external API\n- Formats response to match database columns + small calculations e.g. posting frequency, etc. \n- Store content on S3 + updates formatted response. \n- Stores messages (1 per profile) in SQS. \n\n## DAG 3 (Insert)\n- Polls SQS every 5 mins\n- Get multiple messages from SQS \n- Bulk insert into database\n- Delete multiple messages from SQS  \n\n## Concerns\nI feel like the implementation will work well apart from two things.\n\n1) In DAG 1 I am fetching all the data e.g. max 1 million ids plus a few extra fields and loading them into the python operator before its split into individual rows per creator. I am doubtful that this my cause memory issues because the amount of rows is large but the data size should not be more than a few MBs. \n\n2) In DAG 1 on tasks 2 and 3, splitting the data into separate processes for each profile will trigger 1 million DAG runs. I have set the concurrency limit to control the amount of parallel runs but I am unsure if Airflow can handle this. \n\nKeep in mind there is no heavy processing. All tasks are small, with the longest one taking less than 30 seconds to upload 90 videos + images on S3. All my code on Airflow and I plan to deploy to AWS ECS with auto-scaling. I have not figured out how to do that yet.  \n\n## Alternate Solutions\nAn alternative I can think of is to create a \"DAG 0\" before DAG 1, which fetches the data and uploads batches into SQS. The current DAG 1 will pull batches from SQS e.g. 1,000 profiles per batch and create dynamic tasks as already implemented. This way I should be able to control the number of dynamic DAG runs in Airflow. \n\nA second option is that I don't create dynamic DAG runs for each profile but a batch of 1,000 to 5,000 profiles. I don't think this is a good idea because;\n1) It will create a very long task if I have to loop through all profiles to process them.\n2) I will likely need to host it separately in a container.\n3) Right now, I can see which profiles fail, why, when and where in DAG 2.\n\nI would like to keep things as simple as possible. I also have to figure out how and where to host the pipeline and how much resources to provision to handle the daily profiles target but these are problems for another day.\n\nThank you for reading :D",

Instead of relying on massive general-purpose models, companies will increasingly fine-tune these lightweight models into specialized agents for their particular needs. The economics are compelling - these small models are significantly cheaper to train, deploy, and operate compared to their larger counterparts, making AI accessible to businesses with tighter budgets.\n\nThis creates a huge opportunity for data engineers, who will become crucial in curating the right training datasets for each domain. The lower operational costs mean more companies can afford to experiment with custom AI solutions.\n\nThis got me thinking: what does high-quality training data actually look like for different industries when building these task-specific AI agents? Let's break down what effective agentic training data might contain across various sectors.\n\n**Discussion starter:** What industries do you think will benefit most from this approach, and what unique data challenges might each sector face?",

This is why you have have samples or dummy data to supplement testing when not all data have been cleansed. \n\nHowever, my colleague seems to be adamant that from a risk mitigation perspective, it would be risky for developers not to insist on full data cleansing and migration before testing. While I can understand this perspective, I fail to see how the same cannot be said about the client. \n\nWith that background, I am interested to hear others' thoughts on this.  \n",

This consists of techs like kafka, snowpipe streaming for real time ingestion and also snowpipe/copy jobs for batch processing of files from AWS S3 and then Streams, Tasks, snowflake Dynamic tables for tramsformation. The snowflake account have multiple databases and in that multiple schemas exists but we only want to have the DR configuration done for critical schemas/tables and not full database.\n\nMajority of the component hosted on the AWS cloud infrastructure. However, as mentioned this has also spanned across components which are lying outside the Snowflake like e.g kafka, Airflow scheduler etc. But also within snowflake we have warehouses , roles, stages which are in the same account but are not bound to a schema or database. And how these different components would be in synch during a DR exercise making sure no dataloss/corruption or if any failure/pause in the halfway in the data pipeline? I am going through the below document. Feels little lost when going through all of these. Wanted some guidance on , how we should proceed with this?

One of the primary functions of my current role is to modernize, and I'd REALLY like to make at least a dent in this before starting to look for the next move.\n\nWe recently had a little, but significant, breakthrough with our parent company - they've agreed to build us a standalone database (on-prem SQL...) to pull in data from multiple sources, to act as a basic data warehouse. I cannot undersell how heavy of a lift it was to get them to agree to just this. It's progress, nonetheless. From here, the loose plan is to start building semantic models in Power BI service, and train up our Excel gurus on what that means. Curate some datasets, replace some reports.\n\nThe more I dive into engineering concepts, the more overwhelmed I become, and can't really tell the best direction in which to get started along the right path. Eventually, I'd like to convince our parent company how much better their data system could be, to implement modern tools, maybe add some DS roles to really take the whole thing to a new level... but getting there just seems impossible. So, my question really is, in your experience, what should I be focusing on now? Should I just start by making this standalone database as good as it can possibly be with Excel/Power BI/SQL before suggesting upgrading to an actual cloud warehouse/data lake with semantic layers and dbt and all that fun stuff?",

        "author": "CrimsonPilgrim",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My AWS-based side project has suddenly hit a wall while trying to get resources in a private VPC to reach AWS services.\n\nI'm a junior data engineer with less than a year of experience, and I've been working on a solo project to strengthen my skills, learn, and build my portfolio. Initially, it was mostly a data science project (NLP, model training, NER), but those are now long-forgotten memories. Instead, I've been diving deep into infrastructure, networking, and Terraform, discovering new worlds of pain every day while trying to optimize for every penny.\n\nAfter nearly a year of working on it at night, I'm proud of what I've learned, even though a public release is still a (very) distant goal. I was making steady progress... until four days ago.\n\nSo far, I have a Lambda function that writes S3 data into my Postgres database. Both are in the same private VPC. My database password was fully exposed in my Lambda function (I know, I know... there's just so much to learn as a single developer, and it was just for testing).\n\nRecently, I tried to make my infrastructure cleaner by storing the database password in SSM Parameter Store. To do this, my Lambda function now needs to access the SSM (and KMS) APIs. The recommended way to do this is by using VPC private endpoints. The problem is that they are billed per endpoint, per AZ, per hour, which I've desperately tried to avoid. This adds a significant cost ($14/month for two endpoints) for such a small necessity in my whole project.\n\nI'm really trying to find a solution. The only other path I've found is to use a lambda-to-lambda pattern (a public lambda calls the private lambda), but I'm afraid it won't scale and will cause problems later if I use this pattern every time I have this issue. I've considered simply not using SSM/KMS, but I'll probably face a similar same issue sooner or later with other services.\n\nIs there a solution that won't be billed hourly, as it dramatically increases my costs?",

Had to build proper validation and integrity checks.\n* Schema management nightmare - any data structure changes required vendor coordination to prevent breaking their scripts. Massively slowed our release cycles.\n* Processing delays - several hours between data ready and actually processed, depending on their polling frequency.\n\nTL;DR: Secure file upload is great for security/simplicity but budget significant time for monitoring, validation, and vendor communication overhead.\n\nAnyone else dealt with similar challenges?

Ingestion → The agent ingests alerts, logs, configs, and monitoring data.\n2. Entity extraction → From that, it creates nodes like service, deployment, pod, node, alert, metric, code change, ticket.\n3. Graph building → It links them:\n   * service → deployment → pod → node\n   * alert → metric → code change\n   * ticket → incident → root cause\n4. Querying → When a new alert comes in, the agent doesn’t just check “what fired.” It walks the graph to see how things connect and retrieves context using lighrag (graph traversal + lightweight retrieval).\n\n**Example:**\n\n* engineer get paged on checkout-service\n* The agent walks the graph: checkout-service → depends\\_on → payments-service → runs\\_on → node-42.\n* It finds a code change merged into payments-service 2h earlier.\n* Output: “This looks like a payments-service regression propagating into checkout.”\n\n**Why we like this approach:**\n\n* so cheaper (tech company can have 1tb of logs per day)\n* easy to visualise and explain\n* It gives the agent long-term memory of infra patterns: next time the same dependency chain fails, it recalls the past RCA.\n\nwhat we used:\n\n1. lightrag [https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG)\n2. mastra for agent/frontend: [https://mastra.ai/](https://mastra.ai/)\n3. the agent: [https://getcalmo.com/](https://getcalmo.com/)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We started with a simple AI agent for data queries but quickly realized we needed more: root cause analysis, anomaly detection, and new functionality. Extending a single agent for all of this would have made it overly complex.\n\nSo instead, we shifted to MCP (Model Context Protocol). This turned our agent into a modular AI Analyst that can securely connect to external services in real time.\n\nHere’s why MCP beats a single-agent setup:\n\n**1. Flexibility**\n\n* *Single Agent*: Each integration is custom-built → hard to maintain.\n* *MCP*: Standard protocol for external tools → plug/unplug tools with minimal effort.\n\nThis is the only code your would need to post to add MCP server to your agent\n\nSample MCP configuration\n\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n\n**2. Maintainability**\n\n* *Single Agent*: Tightly coupled integrations mean big updates if one tool changes.\n* *MCP*: Independent servers → modular and easy to swap in/out.\n\n**3. Security & Governance**\n\n* *Single Agent*: Permissions can be complex and less controllable (agent gets too much permissions compared to what is needed.\n* *MCP*: standardized permissions and easy to review (read-only/write).\n\n&#8203;\n\n    \"servers\": {\n        \"filesystem\": {\n          \"permissions\": {\n            \"read\": [\n              \"./docs\",\n              \"./config\"\n            ],\n            \"write\": [\n              \"./output\"\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n\n👉 You can try out to connect MCP servers to data agent to perform tasks that were commonly done by data analysts and data scientists: [GitHub — datu-core](https://github.com/Datuanalytics/datu-core). The ecosystem is growing fast and there are a lot of ready made MCP servers\n\n* [**mcp.so**](http://mcp.so) — a large directory of available MCP servers across different categories.\n* [**MCPLink.ai**](http://MCPLink.ai) — a marketplace for discovering and deploying MCP servers.\n* [**MCPServers.org**](http://MCPServers.org) — a curated list of servers and integrations maintained by the community.\n* [**MCPServers.net**](http://MCPServers.net) — tutorials and navigation resources for exploring and setting up servers.\n\nHas anyone here tried building with MCP?

You know the drill: you inherit a massive BTEQ script with no documentation and have to spend hours, sometimes days, just tracing the data lineage to figure out what it's actually doing before you can even think about modifying or debugging it.\n\nOut of that frustration, I decided to build a little side project to make my own life easier, and I thought it might be useful for some of you as well.\n\n**It's a web-based tool called SQL Flow Visualizer:** **Link:**[**https://www.dfv.azprojs.net/**](https://www.dfv.azprojs.net/)\n\n**What it does:** You upload one or more BTEQ script files, and it parses them to generate an interactive data flow diagram. The goal is to get a quick visual overview of the entire process: which scripts create which tables, what the dependencies are, etc.\n\n**A quick note on the tech/story:** As a personal challenge and because I'm a huge AI enthusiast, the entire project (backend, frontend, deployment scripts) was built with the help of AI development tools. It's been a fascinating experiment in AI-assisted development to solve a real-world data engineering problem.\n\n**Important points:**\n\n* It's completely free.\n* The app processes the files in memory and **does not store your scripts**. Still, obfuscating sensitive code is always a good practice.\n* It's definitely in an early stage. There are tons of features I want to add (like visualizing complex single queries, showing metadata on click, etc.).\n\nI'd genuinely love to get some feedback from the pros. Does it work for your scripts? What features are missing? Any and all suggestions are welcome.\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

Another thing I see missing is ranking of model efficiency.\n\nI have a ton of text (terabytes for the initial batch, but gigabytes for subsequent incremental ingestions) that I'm indexing and want to crunch through with a 10 minute SLO for incremental ingestions, and I'm spinning up machines with A10Gs to do that, so I care a lot about efficiency. The original MTEB paper does mention efficiency, but I don't see this on the online benchmark.\n\nSo far I've been experimenting with Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B based on vibes (model size + rank on the benchmark). Has the community converged on a go-to model for high-throughput embedding jobs? Or is it still pretty fragmented depending on use case?",

It's worth it, even if you want a job.\n\nProgramming is not coding and it has never been the same and it will never be the same. ChatGPT being able to create a game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is not the same as what a Google senior software engineer is doing on a daily basis. Oftentimes you will hear that in professional settings you will spend more time writing out designs and reading code and in meetings that writing actual code and that is true. Meaning building out your problem solving and communication skills is way more important that anything AI could spit out. If you are truly investing all your time into AI thinking that you will get further than anyone else because you finished a To-Do app in 10 minutes, please think again. Anyone can learn to code. Coding is not what is in demand, it's programming.\n\nCoding is the tippity top of the iceberg, you will not get as far as you think you will without also training your brain. Your brain is the most important tool, not your keyboard. So, use AI wisely and do not fear the future, developers are needed because coding and programming are not the same thing. Learn it, it's fun, you can be very successful if you put in the work, and it can really change the way that you approach every day problems. AI will only replace you if you maintain that mindset of replacement and not of assistance.",

I’d read entire documentation sets before typing. I’d spend days researching best practices instead of just building *something*. And then I’d wonder why nothing stuck.  My learning speed is really too slow. The effect of doing something after reading is definitely not as good as reading while learning.\n\nEvery senior dev says “just build stuff”, and beginners hear that as “just build stuff *correctly*.” That mindset kept me paralyzed. Bad code teaches more than no code. I’ve started using beyz coding assistant, not to hand me solutions, but to help me debug my own broken logic. Explaining *why* something doesn’t work turns out to be the fastest way to understand it.  \n\nNow my rule is build → break → understand → rebuild. The understanding comes *after* the mistakes, not before.  \n\nWhen did you stop watching “just one more tutorial” and start producing bugs instead?

My brain shuts down because I have been on a loop. Whenever I start to learn programming (such as python/C++) from scratch, I reach a certain point and I end up dropping it. Which makes me forget what I’ve learned and I have to begin again. This have gone on numerous times and I feel burnt out stuck in tutorial hell. Having a very short attention span isn’t helping either.\n\nMy ultimate career “fantasy” is being a game developer.\n\nSo my questions are:\n1) Is it too late to get into the programming world, and if I somehow manage to make it, will it be worth it?\n2) how to get out of this burnt out feeling/tutorial hell\n3) any good sources which teaches you programming in an interesting manner?\n\nThanks!\n",

But the computers are government-controlled so there's no admin access, which means I won't be able to install any programs or external tools, only use what's already installed or accessible on a browser or permitted applicaitons. (Maybe I could use some cloud IDEs) We’re allowed to use smartphones during limited hours so I'm guessing I can use tools like Termux to code.\n\nGiven all that, I’d love recommendations on:\n\n1. Books or offline resources in CS/math that are compatible with this kind of setup\n2. Online or mobile-friendly resources, especially ones that work well in Termux or can run from a phone.\n3. Subject areas I should focus on now—things that will help me in my sophomore CS and math courses.\n4. Any strategies or routines that others used during military service or similarly constrained environments to make real progress.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I have successfully completed small projects for my previous company (websites, small apps, basic games), however whenever I try applying these basics to build something useful, I have no idea where to start.\n\nI feel like im stuck in a loop learning variable types, loops, classes, etc, but none of this translates to a real programming job. I have the pieces of the puzzle but I don't know how to put them together. When I search for help or advice online, all I get is the same basic tutorials explaining how to do a while loop.\n\n  \nI have recently applied to a junior position for Python dev, and the small exam they had was... overwhelming.\n\nThey gave me a bunch of files and 2 hours, told me to implement some new classes, refactor some old ones, and I... had no idea where to start. Which file do I even open? Where do I write?\n\nI looked at it as a donkey would look at a palace - I can't even begin to comprehend what is going on. At this defining moment, all of my hours of practicing and building small projects amount to nothing.\n\n  \nThis has been a constant in my programming journey. I keep trying to learn, I see a bunch of tutorials and classes, learn the beginner 10% of programming building blocks but It never progresses into anything. I feel like I will never be able to progress. I feel like a fraud, like I'm wasting my life.\n\nI want to learn and do something with this knowledge.\n\nSo, questions:\n\n* Can anyone tell me how you passed this barrier? Was it even a barrier for you, or is it just me? Did it just click one day randomly? Is there a website/resource/material that helps with this?\n* On a side note, can you tell me tips on landing a programming job and preparing for it? I'm not even worried about salary, just want to get some experience in a real scenario.\n\n  \nJust as a quick info I think some people will ask - I didn't go to university and I don't have a degree - I am an older guy and its hard to do it now. I know you learn a lot there but it's not very viable for me since I have to still pay rent and put food on the table.

(Real work—I got paid to code in each of those for over a year.)\n\n\\- I don’t intend to create the next billion-dollar startup (so I don’t care if it is hard to find people who know the language).\n\n\\- It’s just for fun, and I’m trying to avoid the usual suspects (Go, Python, Java, C#...) that are similar to what I already work with.\n\n\\- Instead of choosing a project and then the language (which is the recommended way to do things), I’m looking for the language first and then seeing what projects can be tackled with it.\n\n\\- It is not a career change, so it’s not important how many jobs are available.\n\nAfter a little research, I found:\n\n\\- **Odin**: interesting, but it is very \"Go-like\".\n\n\\- **OCaml**: I liked it a lot, and it’s out of my comfort zone (which is a plus for me).\n\n\\- **Ada**: an industry standard for avionics and such.\n\n\\- **Zig**: another one that I liked a lot, but it is very \"C-like\".\n\n\\- **Rust**: the last time I used it was when the company was trying to decide between Go and Rust. I only used it for a couple of months, about 2–3 hours a day, and I disliked it a little bit (granted, it was only a couple of months and not much R+D).\n\nSo, this post is more of a \"personal survey\" than a question in itself. I’d love to hear about your experience with any language and what you use it for—the language that gives you the most fun/joy to use, even if it is not mainstream or very well-known.\n\n  \nTo be clean, I know that \"fun\" is very subjective and that's the reason I'm asking for personal experiences and examples of stuff that you've done with it.\n\nGo (which I like a lot) is my daily driver, and I also find myself using it at home, but it feels too much like a continuation of my work. My goal is to create some personal projects, do things for fun, and learn—not just continue with my work.",

I started off my js journey by making simple website etc ... Later after 2019-2020 , pandemic time I started with discord bot , building discord bots improved my skills 10x and learned a lot on backed dev etc ...\n\nDue to personal reasons I couldn't code after 2021 Nov , then after 2 years I started my college , engineering as a cs student , I just did the coding part just for the academic purposes. Around 9 months back I wanted to code my own projects like I did before but I realized I forgot many stuffs and I'm not same anymore so I just learned basics of languages I used to work with back in the days and just build small time stuff with it. I thought I'll take reference from my old projects but sadly I lost all the data , I can't even find my GitHub account I used back then\n\nSo I decided to start fresh and new from the scratch ... Not just for academic purposes but also for my self improvement I got motivated to do my own stuffs just like I used to... I have a vague idea how to start off but would love any tips or any guidance from you guys to lemme know how to start off as a beginner",

And now to the actual question:\n\nCan you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? At the moment I have the impression that every language is able to do anything, just that the speed with which stuff is implemented by the maintainer differs.

        "content": "I’m about to start my 5th year of a Masters in Software Engineering… and I can’t code.\n\nMost of my coursework has been theoretical, so whatever coding I learned was quickly forgotten after exams. The few programming tasks I’ve done were either simple or brute-forced with AI. \nFor example: “You’ve never seen Java before, but here’s a website to pentest and refactor. You’ve got a month, and it’s 50% of your grade. Good luck.” That’s basically been my experience.\n\nI’ve tried doing small projects, but I always get stuck in a cycle:\n- Start something (like Langton’s ant in JS + HTML).\n- Hit a wall (e.g., “how do I make a grid?”).\n- Bang head on it for an hour, then ask AI.\n -Repeat until I have something that “works,” but I don’t feel like I actually learned much.\n- Try to extend it (e.g., Game of Life), realize I don’t understand enough, and give up.\n\nA month later, I’ve forgotten everything anyway.\n\nI’ve gone through this same cycle with Godot, React, etc. — learn a little, get stuck or bored, forget it.\n\nNow, I’ve got a month before uni starts again, and this year I’ll be working on a big, team-based project. My last team project ended with me being kicked out because the others were way ahead (lifelong coders, or just had way more time). I really don’t want that to happen again.\n\nTL;DR: I have one month to get vaguely comfortable coding in some language so I don’t drag down a team project. What’s the best way to break out of the “learn → stuck → forget” cycle and actually build usable coding skills?\n(Sorry for the whinge)",

Instead of feeling more confident in myself as a python dev, I am just constantly looking up libraries and how to use them, most of which I will not remember the exact syntax for, only that they exist. Due to this I feel like I am not getting better at python, only reading and essentially copy and pasting over solutions from the docs. From a c++ perspective I built everything myself, yet in python I know absolutely nothing about how many of these libraries work under the hood. I find myself questioning the use of these projects for learning if I will just forget everything later due to the libraries being endless, it’s not like syntax where I can lock it down and improve.

I thought of diving into web development, but it feels too saturated.  \n\nI’m considering learning  AI/ML or Data Science, but I’m not sure how the market looks for these fields.  \n\nMy plan is to keep improving DSA + another relevant skill/role that has strong demand.  \nWhat I really need help with is:  \n- Which skills/roles should I focus on that are in demand but not super crowded?  \n- Any good courses or resources (paid/free) that you’d recommend for AI/ML, Data Science, or even other in-demand fields?  \n- How should I structure my learning path to make myself industry-ready?  \n\nWould really appreciate any course recommendations or roadmaps that worked for you.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been working in the IT industry for over 7 years, mainly as a **business and systems analyst**. While I’ve gained a lot of valuable experience, I’ve come to realize that this is not the role I want to keep growing in.\n\nI’m genuinely interested in **programming (C/C++), computer networks, and security**, but I’m not sure how to realistically transition into this direction. I have solid knowledge of programming concepts and several languages, but I’ve never worked as a full-time developer, so I lack the practical “hands-on” experience most companies expect.\n\nThe main challenge: my current job takes a lot of time and energy, so it’s difficult to build side projects “just for practice.” I’ve even tried freelancing on platforms like Upwork/Freelancer, but it’s very hard to break through without a portfolio or proven developer background.\n\nWhat I’d love to figure out is how to:\n\n* **Find motivation and structure my learning path** while working full-time.\n* **Get practical experience** (maybe small freelance or side jobs) that actually builds credibility.\n* **Eventually grow into a serious software architect** working on meaningful and technically challenging projects.\n\nFor those who have made a similar transition (from analyst/IT background into C++/systems/security):\n\n* What path would you recommend in my situation?\n* How can I realistically start small without burning out from my main job?\n* Any advice on resources, approaches, or even personal stories would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I have been working as a web developer for two years and when I am looking at the codebases of the projects I am a part of I am unable to understand what is exactly going on. I simply believe that a lot of the code that is written today is unreadable but I am not sure if that's really the case or I am simply not skilled enough.  \n  \nI used to be a perfectionist and when I was working on my own projects it would take even 30 minutes or more to simply decide on naming a variable. Overthinking kept me away from creating and that's the primary reason for which I've wasted a lot of time. I tried to aim for perfection but such thing doesn't exist. I remember once I had the ocassion to talk with a popular car designer at Renault about sketching cars and getting the perfect drawing and he answered me with \"Only God can be perfect.\". Later now, I was able to quit this toxic and not productive mindset of \"aiming at perfection\".   \n  \nStill, that doesn't mean I don't have a sense for order and beauty (I think?). Yes, nothing can be perfect but there are worse or better ways of doing something. When it comes to code, I am a big fan or consistency. What do I mean by that? Be consistent in naming conventions, in programming paradigms and in the location of the created and used modules. I admire simplicity and I dislike complexity.\n\nFor example, one of the most recallable thing is that in the place where I work, when there is an request to update the CSS on a page, we overwrite the element rules. Instead of trying to locate and modify a class on a HTML tag they would write new rules using that tag's ID, would add style directly in HTML or use the !important rule specifier.\n\nWhen it comes to what is JS, code is split around everywhere, hard to trace or reason about. That's something I noticed studying other online smaller projects. I am studying game development on my own at home and when I am reading the source code of some indies... code is literally a weird combination betweeing polling and event driven. I respect both paradigms but combining them, especailly with no comments or no consistency, turns into a nightmare to track. I prefer those 10000 lines of ifs in GameMaker than this weird combination of callbacks and procedural.\n\nMore than anything, I admire code that is consistent and ordered. If a module is chaotic, then that chaos is the module's chaos and trapped in there. If the module has proper wiring between input, outputs and isn't tangled with the main application as a complete monolith, that specific part can be much more easily refactored or replaced in case of need (for later optimization or other stuff).\n\nAlso, tutorials. Everytime and then when I want to start learning a new library or framework or whatever, tutorials simply get into unnecessary specifics. For example, I want a 2 minute tutorial to teach me about creating an endpoint. But most tutorials start to delve inside unrelated stuff like ORMs or authentification. Yes, these are important, but right now we were talking about url endpoints, right? That's like learning the piano and out of nowhere \"yo, check out these guitar strings\" when trying to become a musician.\n\nI hope I didn't write too much BS but to end this post gracefully I will leave here my question (which is also present in the title) : Are some codebases really unredable or am I simply dumb? Is reading codebases a skill in itself? Then how do you become better at it? Has it ever occured to you to find a codebase where your first impression was \"that's pure art!\" ?  \nThanks for reading.",

So my problem isn't really that I feel I can't learn it. The problem is that I don't know what are the things that I need learn. \n\nI wish there was a list of the basic things all webdevs should know about. I used to think that list comprised HTML, CSS, Javascript and your backend languages and frameworks of choice, but apparently there is much more (haha). \n\nSince I am planning to start alone as a freelancer, I feel like I should know a little bit of all the essential necessary tools/resources. But for that, I would have to know what that encompasses.\n\nAnyway, if anyone could help me be less confused I would be really thankful! (And sorry if I said anything stupid.

But now I am on day 20 and she changed the way the lessons were constructed. Usually she would talk about a new topic and then she would tell us about a challenge(the basics and requirements of it) and then tell us to try to do it ourselves. But in day 19 and 20 she just coded the entire thing without letting me do anything. This feels dissappointing as the thing I like the most about this course was that I was learning by actually doing something. My question is: Is this new style temporary or is it going to be like this from now on?",

I'm not sure if I'm explaing this right but here is what I think: when I had localhost backend, everything rendered fine because I was using LocalDateTime, which used my system's local time. But after deploying, the server uses UTC, so the LocalDateTime no longer reflects my actual timezone and that’s why things are off.\n\nHow can I fix this? I read some articles and they said to use OffsetDateTime as the date object type in the backend and then in the frontend i format the date i recieve with the javascript Date object  tto get the right date on the calendar.\n\nIs this the right approach or are other approaches better? (i'm not really sure about this as I don't have much experience).\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Handle the possible error case at the call site. \n\nWith this project, I have several kinds of errors, and some of these kinds of errors require a specific response, as defined by the Microsoft spec.\n\nI'm using the \"?\" and a Result to push errors up the call stack, and right now, most of them just crash the program. This choice was deliberate. I didn't know how I wanted to handle this yet, and for the purpose of development, having the server crash is better for me because I know when and where I have a problem. I dont have to worry about noticing it in my log file or stderr.\n\nI've found the first point where I want to start to handle errors. The client sends messages to the server. I read, deserialize, and parse this message and produce an enum that tells the server what the client wants. Right now, I am reading the bytes out of stdin. I handle io errors here. I have two other functions that handle deserialization using serde to convert the bytes to concrete types and then read the method out of the concete type and match it to a corrisponding enum that the server can do things with.\n\nThis is where I'm hoping for feedback. \n\nWhen would you want to see the three kinds of errors I can expect in this process to be handled? The resulting enum for this process includes an error variant with the option to include the specification defined response error code for the LSP.\n\nShould I push all the errors up from the reader and deserialization process so that I can handle everything at one focal point?\n\nWould it be better to keep the kinds of errors handled at different points? So, reader errors get handled at one spot. Deserialize errors at another point. Method parsing errors at another point? Is there another approach I've not considered? \n\nWhat does a good error handling strategy look like to experienced programmers, and what advice can you offer to ensure verbose error handling for my project?\n\nThanks for your time.",

You can pass strings, booleans, numbers, functions, etc. directly in JSX, and it just works.\n\nThis makes me wonder: isn’t React’s approach obviously more advantageous? With `{ }`, you don’t need to remember different syntaxes, it feels like “property binding that always works”.\n\nSo my question is: **why didn’t Angular just make** `{{}}` **work the same way?** Is there some hidden benefit in Angular’s stricter separation (interpolation vs property binding), or is it just a design philosophy thing?\n\nI would be very thankful to hear from you, especially from people who’ve used both frameworks.",

For example, how does the first assembler itself run? How was a text processing program created from bare hardware, called assembler? Instead, the book says, “Here’s an assembler, just write it in Java/Python using our API”. The course leans on abstraction barriers and assumes you’re okay using a modern host computer as scaffolding.\n\nMy frustration is that I don’t just want to *use* an API to get the point, I want to see the mechanics of bootstrapping everything from the ground up, without skipping levels.

        "content": "(Sorry for my bad english)\n\nHi, Im a 16 year old kid who wants to build a website for the lowest cost possible, where I upload educational tutorials for certain subjects, using a YouTube embedded video player for rural kids in India (Most people in India dont have access to Wi-Fi and often resort on mobile data). I designed this project with my friend as a non-profit organisation that we could write on our common apps. I know HTML, CSS and very minimal JS, but not enough to code a website for both frontend or backend. Im going to host the server through Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare pages, and obtain and try to get a 5-6$ domain off cloudflare registrar since I've heard they only have ICANN cost and some other minimal costs. The thing is, Idrk how to code JS and Ive never really had any JS projects in the past. My website will have a minimal backend, no login/registration, just a dashboard explaining the site, and hyperlinks to different subjects and tutorials My friend has recorded. I was wondering if it would be possible to use AI 'vibecoding' tools like v0, cursor, perplexity, claude, gpt to help me learn and use JS alongside framer and figma for the UI design. Although ive seen these tools making extremely basic websites I really dont believe they can build a semi-decent functional website that can have traffic of upto 10-15 people without encountering issues. Even with the assistance of these tools, I dont think I myself would be able to make a good frontend either so im wondering whats the best way for me to do this project. I need this project to be done in a month, Im open to using WordPress or Wix if push comes to shove. Thank you for any assistance, and I hope something works out for me in the end.\n\n(The only programming ik is C up until OOP, so im kind of using this project as an excuse to force myself to learn javascript)",

For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??\n\nI'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow.

        "author": "cs-grad-person-man",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.\n\n[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. \n\n[Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. \n\n[Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. \n\nSo why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.\n\nMeanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.\n\nThey make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.\n\nThe quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.\n\nThe truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life. Even in 2024 and 2025, software engineering remains one of the happiest and most rewarding professions you can choose, as long as you understand that most developers do not live the FAANG nightmare that dominates this subreddit.",

Sorry, but your college probably ripped you off. take it up with them. seriously.\n- Efficiency in software development process has improved remarkably with cloud, devops\n- Most developers aren't really good at building resilient, hardened systems.\n- Many seasoned devs have a sense of entitlement and an aversion to acquiring new skills on their own\n- Offshoring is accelerating\n\n\nAside from all of this, it is easy to get crushed by toxic management culture and most devs don't realize that they are actively competing for a piece of the pie with layers of useless middle managers who excel at stealing accomplishments.

If you aren't already raging, here's my advice:\n\n- Learn how to self-manage and take credit for your own work\n- Work fast, take risks, don't worry about tech debt (your managers don't)\n- Never stop expanding your skill set. We are never done learning. AI, infrastructure management, scalability, data pipelines\n- If you are American, fight offshoring and H1B head on by proving you are more valuable and less of a hassle, voting won't make a difference there.

        "author": "ExpensivePost",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Novel warning, but it's a good one IMO, tldr at the bottom\n\nThis is probably a common scam, but it was new to me so I figured I'd post it here in the off chance it helps someone avoid unwittingly destroying their entire company.\n\nFor some time we had been getting flooded with nearly identically formatted resumes that were all very low quality. They were loaded with random keywords from our postings to try to maximize automated ranking but used very poor grammar or just nonsense word soup.\n\nThey were all PDFs and all of them had similar metadata that was unique to them so I just wrote a script for our recruiters to auto-reject all of them.\n\nWe got tons of them for every pure-remote posting, never in-office, or even hybrid.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me so I tried to schedule a tech screen with a few of them. Most ghosted, but I was able to actually get on a call with one.\n\n* The name was very English, first and last.\n* Age was late 20's which was a bit young given the timeline shown in the work history and education, but not impossible. It put them finishing their BS right at 21.\n* Location was listed as Austin, Texas and indicated that they were legal to work in the US without visa endorsement.\n* They listed a BS in Game Programming from Full Sail University (private, for-profit, online). I've had limited but mixed experience with their grads. Not an auto-reject school, but it's not going to help your resume really.\n* They had some work history with several short-term contracts with random non-us based small game studios and one 2-year stint with a well-known, but long defunct American studio. The timeline was a a bit dense with their first 2 contract gigs overlapping with their last year of college.\n\nUnfortunately for this person, the games industry is fairly small and I have close friends who were at the studio they listed at the time they reported having worked there. One of my friends would have been the director of the team this person reported having been a junior engineer on. My friend confirmed without question that this person was never at that studio and was never on his team.\n\nOnce I got on the call (zoom), it was clear the the person was not a native English speaker. Which isn't a problem, they were conversational, just incongruitous with the name. The age also seemed unlikely; this person was probably over 40, though I've been more off on age guesses before. I'm familiar with Austin so I asked about the city a bit. It was clear that the person had never been there, let alone lived there.\n\nI poked at their technical skills and they actually seemed like they had some programming knowledge, but nothing close to what their experience and education would suggest. They used jargon more in-line with a very junior web developer than a mid-level game engineer. C++ was very weak, no knowledge of basic game design principles, and they couldn't speak at all to basic game development team structure or workflows.\n\nI was ready to get to the truth so I asked where they were calling from, making up some bullshit their IP address looking unusual (lie, zoom doesn't expose that). They said they were visiting family in Delhi but would be back in the US before the start date. I asked to confirm their legality to work in the US and they confirmed what was in their application and added that they were a natural born American citizen.\n\nI asked about their experience at the US-based game studio. I asked some specifics about their internal processes that you would only know if you were actually working there as an engineer (they had an unusual source-control workflow). Candidate had no clue and made up some bullshit. I asked about their responsibilities on the team and who they reported to; more bullshit.\n\nTime to take the mask off.\n\nI told them I know they never worked at that studio. I told them I know they've never been to Austin. And I asked directly: what's your goal here? They tried to redirect, and doubled down on the bullshit, clearly not understanding that the scam was over. So I asked about the name on the application: Is that a real person? Did you steal their identity? Are they in on it like some sort of employment mule? They immediately dropped from the call.\n\nAfter the call, I hit up our legal department and asked them to see if the name on the application could be identified as a real person (possibly in Austin). Turns out the name was just uncommon enough and we had just enough PII that it did match a likely real person in Austin. Legal notified the Austin PD about the probable identity theft (or possibly an accomplice to fraud) and that was the last I heard about it.\n\nMy theory is that the scammers get enough info about an American to secure a remote job with that identity (really they just need a name, DoB, and SSN). They rely on companies not verifying their education and employment history (which they make difficult using small and defunct companies). Then they spam every possible remote job listing hoping to overwhelm their recruiting pipeline and sneak someone through. I imagine they would do just enough to not get immediately fired and collect a paycheck while exfiltrating as much source code, data, and other assets of value as possible once they have access. I would be surprised if they didn't also try to plant ransomware or other malware to company systems or worse, customers.\n\nThis was a few months ago, and I'm no longer at that company, but their current director has told me that the resume script is still working and hitting about a hundred resumes per posting, still only for remote roles.\n\nIf you have this issue, look at the PDF metadata and it should be pretty obvious what pattern I'm talking about. My script was very simple using PyMuPDF to read metadata to identify and filter them.\n\ntldr: Got lots of similar, sketchy resumes for remote postings only. I investigated and actually spoke to one of them. It was a scam.",

        "content": "I see a lot of posts here from people struggling with imposter syndrome, trying to learn \"everything,\" and burning themselves out. I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.\n\nThe Reality Check:\n\nWhen I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\n\n\\- Memorising every framework and language\n\n\\- Writing perfect code from day one\n\n\\- Working insane hours to \"prove myself\"\n\n\\- Never admitting I didn't know something\n\nAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.\n\nWhat Actually Matters:\n\nFor Job Applications:\n\nYou don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.\n\nFor Learning:\n\nStop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.\n\nFor Career Growth:\n\nYou'll never feel \"ready\" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.\n\nFor Productivity:\n\nWorking 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.\n\nFor Code Quality:\n\nNobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable. Write for the human who will read your code at 2 AM during an outage.\n\nI've written a comprehensive blog post with detailed examples and actionable advice for each of these points: [https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412](https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412)\n\nCurrent developers: What do you wish you'd known earlier?\n\nJob seekers: Which of these resonates most with your current struggles?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI graduated about 2 months ago and decided to take a month off because finishing my degree was really stressful. Right now, I’m working at one of the most popular restaurants in NYC, making around **$115k working just 4 days a week**. This job put me through college and helped me graduate debt-free, which I’m super thankful for. Before this, the most I ever made was around $50k a year at any other restaurant, so this income honestly feels unreal.\n\nBut being honest, seeing all the millionaires who dine here, I really want to break into the field I studied. I don’t want to be the server forever, I want to be the one being served, like those customers.\n\nThat said, I never got an internship during college. I started at community college and thought internships were only for people already in a bachelor’s program. By the time I transferred, I felt like my projects weren’t strong enough, and I missed opportunities. Senior year came and went without an internship too.\n\nNow I’m job hunting. I’ve applied to 100+ positions this past month (mostly C++ and Python roles — C++ is really my strong suit). I do have some better projects now, but the market feels brutal. I’m not sure if I should set a “limit” on how long to keep applying before focusing my energy elsewhere.\n\nI love the restaurant job I have now, and I never expected it to be this lucrative, but at the same time, I don’t want to feel like I wasted 4 years of my life on my degree.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone here broken into tech with a similar background (no internships, starting a bit late)? I’d love to hear your stories or advice.\n\n**TL;DR:** Graduated 2 months ago with no internships, applying to 100+ jobs (C++/Python). Currently making $115k working 4 days a week at a top NYC restaurant. Love the money, but want to break into tech, has anyone succeeded in a similar situation?",

That day was my first time being laid off.\n\nSo when I was job hunting, I made sure to target more established companies this time as I thought it would bring me more stability. During interviews, I specifically asked about company stability related questions. For example, I asked questions about how often layoff occurs and about the length of the tenure of the employees on the team. The hiring manager gave me the usual spiel about how yes, they'd had layoffs the previous year, but my role would be \"more secure\" since those cuts mainly hit non-dev positions. When I asked about team tenure, the interviewers gave the impression that the people had been there for years.\n\nToday, my director messaged asking if I had \"a moment to chat\" and I knew I was about to be cut. It's the same dance as last year where manager suddenly requested a meeting with me. The director told me it wasn't performance orientated as 15% of the company got laid off but I still feel like maybe if I was better at my job I would be one of the \"safe\" people.\n\nI spent the rest of the day doing damage control on my finances, cancelling the subscriptions I don't need, trying to get my head straight. The timing just feels particularly brutal because my team has been grinding through overtime these past few weeks, pulling extra hours just to so we can finish our project on time and meet our side of the service level agreement.\n\nAll those late nights, all that extra effort and for what? It's exhausting as none of it seems to matter in the end. After my first layoff my confidence in my programming skills already took a fall and now I sometimes feel that maybe I don't have the skills to succeed and they're just cutting the weak links.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to post it here if anyone has any guidance.",

A lot of my co-workers and ex-bosses have wanted me to tag along, and I've been chasing money and benefits without really think of much anything else.\n\nThe problem is: I've never had to work very deep in any of this. My React App is a very barebones. We have only just started using ADO for version control (I'm a solo dev there and out EIT department is just now requiring it).\n\nMy data analytics projects have never been complex SQL. I know CTEs, windows functions, and enough to get the job done.\n\nI've built a few regression models that have gone nowhere. Companies are slowly finding out that \"simpler\" analysis brings much more realistic results than a fancy model.\n\nI've built very small data pipelines (Data scraping with Python -> clean in python -> SQL) to clean data and have built some very barebones schemas.\n\nBut I look at the job market and everything is progressing at a much faster rate than what I know. I'm afraid I'm being left behind with my age, new technologies, and knowing many tools but not being great at any of them.\n\nThoughts on this? Thanks for listening.",

I worked in a different industry prior to this and even though that industry is not known for sympathetic people, it was like night and day compared to this one. The endless outsourcing and abuse that comes from management onto those workers seeps over to US workers as well. Between all the problems going on outside work (I am seeing a therapist, please do not tell me that will fix my problem) and the stress from this industry is becoming too much for me.\n\nI am seeking advice on maybe a place where I can pivot that will lead to less stress on the job. I experienced that in this field once with a company I really enjoyed, but that company laid off a bunch of workers (including me) and then turned extremely toxic like the rest of the industry afterwords. Forced attrition cuts each year and killing the supportive culture it had.\n\nWhere can one realistically pivot from a career in SWE to one that has a more chill work environment? One where I feel like I can turn off after work, I don't need to endlessly study for interviews outside work, and one where work is steady and there is none of this PIP culture or x% of people need to be laid off each year? I will take a pay cut (as long as it is a livable wage) for this type of job. Key word though is it has to be livable wages for today (so minimum 80k, but can be higher obviously).\n\nI truly do love coding, but I hate what this industry has become. Does anyone have real advice on where one can pivot too for what I am seeking? It can be tech related or non-tech related. The only thing I ask is that there is a realistic path to getting there.",

Done well, got awards, recently got promoted to SWE III\n\n\nMy current job makes me dread life. I’m at a SWE consulting firm and although I’ve done really well here on paper, I can’t take it anymore. 12+ hour days for 3 years, micromanagement, insane pressure from higher ups, unrealistic expectations from clients (because my firm is expensive) and my own firm (because be faster so we can sell more)… and I’ve sort of reached my limit. for the first time in my life, I had a panic attack and freakin hyperventilated in my hotel room after a terrible day in the client’s office. What adds to my stress is that I don’t have time to practice leetcode / system design interviews because I’m working so much, so I’m feeling trapped. \n\nFinancially I’m set, have do debt and solid savings and could weather a long stint. I’m confident if i had the time, I could get great at interviews again and land something, but the uncertainty with this market kills me.

        "author": "Dreadsin",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm *pretty sure* this all started one day where I was given a very large task, basically go through every design and break it down to components, then create a design system from that meeting some requirements. I made a notion doc, shared it, and worked through it. My manager told me to make tickets for it, I said I wasn't yet done with breaking things down, she got really mad and reassigned it to another teammate with no warning so I stopped working on it\n\nShe said (quote) \"\\[redacted\\] will be leading the theming & tokens initiative, but he's on PTO this week. he'll help build out the project w/ its various phases & tickets. i'm creating some tickets with explicit tasks for you to get started\". She then assigned me a small handful of tickets. I didn't totally understand what the actual implication of that new guy being the lead of the project meant, and she didn't explain it, so I figured it just meant \"stop working on this project\". I don't want to ask, because she responds to questions **very** negatively.\n\nWe had a 1:1 where she mentioned a lot of very strange things. She said I should implicitly know what to work on 100% of the time and it's \"not her job\" to give me work to do. One thing that also came up was that I took a ticket which was \"meant\" to be for support, but was actually just sitting at the top of the backlog. To her, this was a really big miss on my part and she wouldn't stop talking about it. To me, I just saw a ticket with high priority on the backlog and grabbed it\n\nSince then, she was downright *aggressive*. I'm talking, every time I put in a pull request she'd rip it apart, but without looking at the code. She'll nitpick the description, the title, pretty much everything but the code. Some were such bizarrely small nitpicks. Prime example, I made a fix for a footer component so my commit message was like \"\\[FE-29\\] {footer} fixes the way images display in dark mode on the footer component\". She said that I really messed up because I didn't include a link to the storybook. I was a bit confused because a bot usually deploys it then comments the link. I asked what she meant, and she said \"I need an EXACT LINK to the footer component in dark mode\", followed by a lot of derisive comments about how I never do anything right. To me, I thought \"it says the component and it says dark mode... just click the link, click footer, and click dark mode...?\". It was never a stated convention that we would have to post a direct link\n\nLater she comments how I'm on \"thin ice\" and how I need to tell her what I'm working on this week. I ask her a few things about prioritization, which I get a lot of non-answers to. So, I get really specific. \"Looking at both the boards, it appears the button component is the next highest priority. Is that right?\", she then explains what the component library *is* as if I haven't been working on it. The only hint is she said \"priority ahead of that is working on your existing PRs\", so it seems like she's saying \"yes, after you finish your existing PRs, do the button\"\n\nFrankly, I'm a bit annoyed with the indirectness so I say \"so should I take the button component? Yes or no?\", which she said \"i'm looking for you to create a weekly work plan w/ prioritized tasks from the available information\". So then I say \"... ok... so I guess I'll take the button?\", and she replied \"i've asked for a weekly work plan — this includes a list of items that you plan to dedicate time to this week\"\n\nSo I gather 4-5 tickets and send them to her. I accidentally didn't include the button (just messed up one link) and before I could even edit, she started berating me and she said she was prepping to put me on PIP. I tried explaining to her, \"the reason I'm asking you this is because you reassigned that project to someone else and told me you'd make tickets for me. Because of that, I thought that you wouldn't want me to blindly take tickets and work on them\". Just the previous week, I got in trouble for taking one of \"her\" tickets, despite the fact that it was sitting in the backlog not assigned to her\n\nI got really frustrated with her at this point and reached out to my previous manager. I said I feel like I can't communicate clearly with this manager, and she set up a meeting with me and the skip. Really, I just can't deal with the leading questions, non answers, \"quizzing\" me, and negative responses to my questions. I feel unable to have an actual conversation with her without inadvertently pissing her off",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I had a task to make a button component in a shared library as part of a larger initiative. However, in this initiative, there was a ticket which was for making “design tokens”. I read through it, and it detailed we’d have design tokens for broad things like “primary color” and “accent color”. However, it also stated that individual components would have their own design tokens, so if it was a button, it might have “button primary color”. I brought this up to my manager, that I’m not sure if I should be working on the button because it seems dependent on this other ticket. I think there was a whole lot of misunderstandings, but she kinda seemed to get pretty hostile about it\n\nI guess I noticed that I really wasn’t getting anywhere with this conversation and everything I said seemed to make her even more angry. She threatened to put me on PIP at least once during this conversation, which I felt was unmerited, so I disengaged entirely and went to my previous manager. My previous manager is super chill so I was hoping we could just resolve it somehow. She set up a meeting with my skip. I just simply told him the exact situation, kinda in an emotionless, anodyne way. He seemed very receptive to it, surprisingly. He brought up that my manager had negative feedback about me “not following processes”, which we had a long conversation about, and he seemed much more “on my side” than I thought he would be. From my manager’s feedback, you’d think I’m doing everything wrong — but the skip was like “yeah it’s a new thing everyone is adjusting to. You’re fine”. I think this did get my manager in trouble, though\n\nI never did get an answer on the design tokens thing, but I was told to start work on the button. At first I made the button following the design tokens as the document stated, but I was told to remove this. No problem, AI was quickly able to resolve that. But then she started nitpicking pretty much every, insignificant detail. Mind you, this is really just a `<button>` with some tailwind classes applied, with 100% unit test coverage. Specifically, she goes after the storybook (which is just a preview for the components), and constantly changes her mind there. “It should be like this” then I’ll submit it and she’ll be like “no I changed my mind make it like this”. They’re not things I would know as a developer, they’re just subjective preferences like “I want this story to be called (whatever) instead”. I find it all kinda odd, cause there are controls on storybook that let you change the preview. You can configure it to show whatever button you want using those\n\nI also have another ongoing PR for another component. Same thing here, she nitpicks it to death, especially the storybook. It feels like she always has a new thing to add or remove, which at some point just feels entirely unproductive, so I wonder why she’s doing it as my manager if it would reflect poorly on her. Like, even I think this is a waste of everyone’s time at this point, so I get suspicious\n\nThen going back to the other one that originally used design tokens, she insists that I remove a css file that we would use for the design tokens in the future. This is a bit more complex than you’d think because it requires changing the build around and the exports in the package.json and I’m _pretty sure_ it might break tailwind when used in an app. I told her that I don’t think this is a good idea cause we’ll just have to revert it in the future, but she absolutely insists that we must do this. I actually feel kinda uncomfortable with it. I’m essentially making extra work for future me, for no gain and a potential bug\n\nAll this time I notice that she said I would have to ship this button this week _and_ replace all instances of the button in 3 apps. I still think she’s mad about the meeting with the skip manager we had. I really don’t wanna go to him again, but I’m concerned that she’s just trying to justify letting me go by making it impossible for me to get my work done. What should I do?",

I've given him the \"keep applying, it will work out eventually\" spiel, but he's just now really depressed and feeling defeated. He's at the point of \"why finish? What's the point?\" Which is obviously very negative and emotionally driven, but I get the emotion. I just personally try not to linger in it, but he is not me, so.

        "content": "I’ve spent the last 12 years as a developer in a Fortune 500 manufacturing company. I started in college studying IT/cybersecurity and took a short graphic design side gig—but a VBA script I wrote to automate reporting turned me into “the tech guy”. Since then, the company has tripled in size, and I’ve built and maintained a wide variety of internal tools: PLM apps, dashboards, automation systems, integrations, and even a 3D packing tool (Three.js/r3f). I taught myself React/Node, cloud, data engineering, and DevOps. Aside from a few college courses, everything is self-taught and \\~90% custom.\n\nThe catch: I’ve always been completely isolated. No peers, code reviews, or mentors. I report outside the tech org and handle all development myself. My day-to-day includes supporting \\~100 users, gathering pain points, designing features, and doing analytics and reporting, since we don’t have a dedicated data person. It’s demanding—at one point I even debugged production code on a cruise ship in the Atlantic.\n\nI'm underpaid and I want out. What really broke the camel's back was when I took on the 3D packing tool, the agreement was that I'd have hires to help. That was 9 months ago, and it's still just me. I’ve reached a point where I want a team environment, collaboration exposure, and a role that still fits my skills; product engineer, full stack, or technical PM. (I'm an \"Application Project Manager\" by Title). \n\nMy questions:\n\n* How do I translate 12 years of solo experience into interview answers for a team environment?\n* How do I close the gaps in collaboration and code review experience?\n* Which roles make the most sense given my mix of business-facing and technical work?\n\nRecent example: I interviewed for a Support Engineer role last week, made it to round two, and the feedback was: *“You’re very technical, but we need explicit support experience.”* It made me realize I need guidance on positioning and interviewing for traditional tech roles. I don't have any Engineering or Dev friends. Lot of tech peers and friends in PM and Data, but no one to really ask for close advice. \n\n**TL;DR:** 12 years as a lone dev in a non-tech Fortune 500 (Excel → PHP/jQuery → React/Node/Three.js). Built critical internal tools solo. Looking to move into a team-based tech role—how should I position myself, fill collaboration gaps, and navigate interviews? Anyone else have a story like this? \n\nThanks!! ",

        "content": "I'm getting 15+ calls a day from recruiters who barely speak English and every conversation is the exact same and pointless. They ask questions that are easily understood from my resume - \"How many years experience do you have?\" - Per my resume, I have 14 years experience. \"How many years do you have in information security?\" - Per my resume, I have 14 years experience. \"How many years experience do you have in risk?\" - Per my resume, I have 14 years experience in risk. Followed up by the exact same questions every time - \"What is your birth month and day?\", \"What is your citizenship status?\", \"What is your salary expectation?\". Their English is so bad, it's hard to understand what they're even saying and I keep repeating - \"Just send me an email\"... \"What is your citizenship status?... Just send me an email with all your questions\". \"I need to know your salary expectations\"... Just send me an email.\n\nThey also think they're slick and when I ask salary expectations, they reverse it and ask how much I'm looking for, leading to the exact same line of questioning \"What is the rate for this role?\"... \"What are you expecting?\".... \"No, what is the rate?\"... \"How much do you want?\". In all my years experience and many many roles, I HAVE NEVER gotten a job from these types of calls and recruiters. I don't even know who they serve or what their purpose is. The moment I hear the accent, I know it's a waste of my time.\n\nMy favorite debate with recruiters is my location. I tell them I'm in New Mexico and they tell me, \"We need an American\". \"Yes, I'm American, I'm in America\". \"When do you get back to America?\". \"I'm already in America\". \"But we need someone with American citizenship\". \"Yes, I have that\".... \"But when do you get back?\". I have this debate sometimes multiple times a day.",

I know the job market is ultra-competitive right now but it's still my responsibility to work with what I have, and I haven't been.\n\nI realized during the five years I've studied Computer Science that even though I love video-games and thought robotics was alright (I did robotics programming in highschool & during my senior project, mentored by AmazonRobotics), I have no confidence in programming, and frankly, problem-solving in general. Everything is so reliant on connecting/social engineering now that my anti-social ass hasn't been doing. My parents have gotten people from my church and extended family, to give advice to me and frankly I've mostly been ignoring them when they repeat the same stuff I've been hearing for a while now. I apply to X position a family/family friend tells me to apply to, I get rejected/ghosted, repeat ad-nauseam until I stopped applying months down the line out of frustration, lying to them saying \"yeah I applied to plenty of places\". Confidence is at an all-time low.\n\nToday my mom yells at me on how much I've been freeloading and threatens to kick me out, and I couldn't talk back at her because I know she's right.  \n  \n**For the short-term,** I have $2,700 in my bank account, pretty much nothing to live on my own for. I hate being around my family but really want a remote position to show to my parents ASAP, so I don't get the boot. At this point I don't care what field it is, it doesn't have to be CS/programming--I really want to get a remote job in SOMETHING I can tolerate, in the next couple weeks or so while I try and gather my bearings for my future, or else I am likely getting kicked out. Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.\n\n**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \\~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. \n\n**I'm well-aware that my story is not rare. Again, this is my fault. I've been too passive, and arrogant. But today I might as well ask for advice, both for the short and long-term. Thank you.** ",

One of my collaborators is a much older man (I think 40s) from another country(japan).\n\nHow it started:  \n  \nInitially, everything was great and super professional. We communicated on Discord. He would compliment my work, like \"Good job on that template,\" which felt nice and motivating. He was very polite about scheduling meetings across our different time zones.\n\n**When things started to feel weird:**  \nAfter a few days, he learned my age during a call. After that, the dynamic slowly started to change.\n\n1. He suggested we move our conversation from the public Discord to WhatsApp and shared his personal number.\n2. His compliments started shifting from my work to me as a person.\n3. He found out I was interested in some media from his country (like anime/manga) and offered to teach me his language one-on-one.\n4. He started talking about me potentially working in his country in the future and asked if I was interested.\n\n**The part that is freaking me out now:**  \nLast night, the conversation escalated quickly. I asked for his LinkedIn to learn more about his professional background. He sent it, then immediately followed up by saying if I ever came to his country, he would \"show me around.\"\n\nThen he sent these messages back-to-back:  \n\"You are such a kind person.\"  \n\"You are a genius.\"  \n\"I'm serious.\"\n\nThis is where my internal alarms went off like crazy. It felt like a switch flipped from \"polite colleague\" to something intense and personal. It feels like he's trying to build some kind of deep emotional bond, and the \"I'm serious\" part felt like he was pressuring me to accept the compliments.\n\n**My question for you:**  \nAm I overreacting? Is this just a case of \"super politeness\" from a different culture, or is this classic grooming/love-bombing behavior? My gut is screaming that this is wrong, but my logical brain keeps trying to find excuses like \"maybe he's just being nice.\"\n\nWhat do you think is happening here, and more importantly, what is the safest and most professional way to handle this and create distance?\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm 16, my much older male colleague moved our chat to WhatsApp, and his praise has escalated to \"you're a genius, I'm serious\" after inviting me to visit him in his country.

        "content": "BLUF:  I'm 45, MS & BS in CS and in technical management at a national lab.  I came here because I was sick of industry, venture capital, layoffs, etc. The lab's comp and benefits package was enough for me to say fuqqit to private industry's higher comps and volatility.  I also noticed the workforce skewed older, and surmised less ageism in the tech roles here.  Glad to say I've been right so far.  Finally, in the back of my mind I always wished I had earned a PhD so that I could be an expert in something.  Doesn't mean I wanted to do pure research per-say, but just to have developed depth. The lab is supportive of that - extra time off, free grad school, connections, etc. \n\nSince I'm just over halfway through my career I've really started to map out my off ramp.  The math says I can probably retire in 10 years (age 55) if I stay, thanks to a great 401K match and a small windfall I got earlier this year.  There is also a tuition benefit for my kids: half off in-state if my kids qualify academically.  Since I have 4, that's going to help a lot :). \n\nTo make it work though, I feel a strong need to do one last push with my education and personal development, and that is where I could use some perspective from other late career folks in tech.  Some paths open before me are:\n\n\\- Project & Program Management.  In addition to my tech management role, I manage a \\~$16M contract (finances, staffing, direction, etc).  I've thought I should just get a PMP so I can check the box and have some more options.  (P.S. I feel like its fine to be \"older\" in these kind of management roles).\n\n\\- Go for a PhD in CS with an AI focus.  The lab has plenty of academic affiliations where I could seriously pursue this part-time. It would take a while, but I'd still feel good about it as a life goal.  Then maybe I can teach at the community college nearby.   My MS was relatively recent (5 years ago) with an AI/ML focus and straight As.  I can do well academically when I put my mind to it. \n\n\\- Get an MS/Dr. Eng in Systems Engineering so I can broaden the projects I work on.  I've always been the guy who could extract requirements, model different approaches, build schedules, budgets, etc.  I wrote plenty of code - but also raised my hand to do all the other stuff because I like variety.  Probably why I'm doing some project management now.\n\n\\- A wilder option is a (slow) pivot into computational physics, since we do tons of computational modeling and simulation for all sorts of scenarios that might arise in the defense of our nation.  That just might mean an Applied Physics MS to start, but I could see going all the way with a PhD (probably earned at 60 though :) ).  Intellectually, this grabs me the most because it would probably stretch me the most - I love learning - and get me into some really cool work.\n\nI haven't done exhaustive pros/cons to these and thats probably my next step.  I'd still like some outside perspective from later career folks in CS who have maybe walked some of these paths and could provide an opinion. I'm wrestling with the feeling that this would be my last big career development goal, and I need to pick the \"right\" one.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I've read a lot of different questions and suggestions on things early developers might want to consider but this is one I actually haven't heard as much and something I wish I had started doing day 1 of my career.\n\nWhen I started out my focus was on trying to learn software development. I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.\n\nthere are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. \n\nIve worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.\n\nthat said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me.\n\n If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.\n\nlooking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.\n\nanyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming. SWE skills are important, and most of the time we can learn the bits and pieces of a domain we need at the time, but some insights are locked behind both a general understanding of the tech and the domain.",

The first interview was behavioral, which was amazing because that lessened SO MUCH PRESSURE, but now I'm concerned about the second interview!\n\nI was studying data structures & algorithms; seemed to be the thing I forgot the most of, and will most likely continue studying it to get it back in my head, but I keep having small hiccups. One main problem I am noticing is my organizational skills regarding programming. Don't get me wrong, I know how to code, but by the time VSC or PyCharm is opened in front of me, I blank on where to start. A great example of this is when I'm writing code, I'm mainly using ChatGPT to get the baseline, then modify it from there, or look at examples and modify it to my liking. Is there any methods I should be doing? \n\nFinally, is there anything that I definitely need to remember? It's been a while and was just wondering for a great place to start again, back to basics for a refresher if that's the case? Any help is greatly appreciated. I truly wish to succeed with this job interview and I'm nervous that I'm going to fail. \n\nThank you,   \nFrom a Grad Student who's never been in the Software Developer field and lost some knowledge on programming <3",

My family does not really want to move to the US and I don’t want to leave them full time either. I was thinking of renting an apartment 30 min or so across the border and just staying the 3-4 days a week and spending the rest of the week at home in Canada.

        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI've been hitting a wall with how to proceed with my career and just looking for some advice or some words of wisdom. I've gotten a good position that I've held for the past 4 years but now fear that I am stuck. I work for a relatively large company making a total comp that makes me feel the 'Golden Handcuffs' feeling.  \nHere's where the problem comes though, recently the company has made a shift to non-remote, now I wasn't originally remote but they closed the office that I could commute to. Therefore I will need to move to San Francisco by Jan 1 in order to keep my current job. If I move I will get an 11% bump in pay which will not cover the jump in living expenses but I'd still be comfortable. However, I have not enjoyed the job and constantly feel like I'm not performing at the level they expect (despite getting positive reviews, this might just be my imposter syndrome but it's killing my quality of life). So I'll just find a new job no big deal right? Wrong, I have been met with countless no's and poor interview experiences. I fear that I have gotten to deep into how this company builds things and have lost sight on how to be marketable in the job force. For those who are still reading and are interested, I am an android developer but haven't gotten much industry experience with Jetpack Compose. Lately I've been doing more low level sensors related work (Bluetooth, location, accelerometer). But even that work is kind of built on the backs of previous team members. I feel like I haven't been really able to truly build something myself and don't even really enjoy the work per-say. Is it time to move to another domain? How would I even do that? I'd like to get out of mobile and maybe pursue something more java backend like or a Go type of role but not really sure how to start that or even what tech stack to use.\n\nFor those of you who think I should just take the offer and move to San Francisco my concern is more than just the fact that I don't really enjoy the work I also have a partner who has a job she enjoys in the town that we live in... So my dilemma is why would I move half way across the country for a job I don't enjoy, rip her from a job she enjoys... for money? We will be married soon and probably trying for kids... do I want my nights that should be the happiest of my life to be stressed by this job I kind of hate? If I do make a job move how do I deal with all the rejection? How do I make myself better? I have a enterprise Udemy account in which I can seem to enroll in any class but even the motivation behind that feels low. Should I be focusing on Android classes to improve my current skill set or working on a whole new one? Will I even be able to get a job in this new domain with just some personal projects?\n\nPerhaps this is more of a rant than anything, maybe I just needed to get this out of my system and out into the internet but I've just been a little depressed about all this lately and feeling very unsure of my future. FWIW anyone who thinks I should be talking to someone about this I am utilizing therapy to try and get out of this funk but it just feels like anyone I talk to doesn't understand the tech side of things and just says I'll be ok, I must be smart if they hired me and haven't PIP'd me yet... Which just feels empty coming from people who don't understand the field.",

        "content": "I graduated a little over a year ago and by some miracle got offered a job in a DevOps/platform engineer role straight after graduation despite all my internship and college experience lining up more with data analytics & BI, which I graduated with flying colors and gleaming reviews for those areas of expertise (not to flex, I just mean I know i'm also good at it). That's also where my passion actually lies. However, I still took the devops offer because with the way the job market is, I just didn't want to risk anything (it was my only offer amongst many rejections, even to the more relevant roles to my resume). I've been passively applying here and there, tailoring my CV and doing side projects for data analytics and no luck. There are rarely any entry level jobs, yet somehow many internships (which are aimed at students, and I wouldn't actually be able to support myself with anyways)\n\nI'm still not finding the joy in devops almost a year in but now I'm starting to consider just sucking it up, going all in and focus all my efforts in becoming a great devops engineer (courses & certifications). My question is, do you think a career switch later down the line would be possible, and if so how can I work towards that? I feel like I'm just not getting any resume experience while the field will keep growing rapidly and self learning can only get me so far. Should I just stick to devops altogether?\n\nEdit: added additional context in first paragraph ",

        "content": "I am a backend software engineer with 6.5 years of experience. I think that skills as an engineer are becoming dull everyday as the projects in my team are not interesting and I have been mainly getting migration/maintenance work despite my protests. Also, I am not getting enough opportunities to interview for other companies because of the shit job market. \n\nI want to upgrade and sharpen my skills as a dev and improve my resume at the same time, my resume since my current work is not anything too special to highlight. But I am confused on what direction I need to take in order to improve as a mid level to senior level developer. \n\nI don’t think building some boilerplate projects like a to do list or a note taking app would be helpful for my skills or resume, since I am not at entry level(though I doubt if it even works for them these days). Nor would leetcode. I do study system design on the side, which might help me if I get some interesting work or while interviewing, but it does not help in strengthening my resume. What should I do then in order to get noticed more for opportunities while also improving my skills? \n\nSome people have advised to build software projects to solve problems that I personally face and not some common course project. But I am completely out of ideas and inspiration to solve any issues that I might face. I can’t think of any problem that I need to desperately solve by building an app. What else should I do? I think that my career is plateauing and I would not be able to keep up with the job market with the way things are going",

        "content": "Hello! I started working at a FAANG+ company (big tech, everyone here would know the name) as an entry-level SWE about 10 months ago, right after school. I got an invitation to interview at a startup (YC backed, though now has 100+ employees) and decided to do it just as an excuse to keep my leetcode skills fresh.\n\nI somehow ended up doing well and am now in their team matching process. They are asking me to meet with hiring managers etc.\n\n**Issue 1: Should I be considering this job with <1 yoe?**\n\n* The new job is better paying (by about 20k looking at base, and 60k if I expect their stock to have any value anytime soon).\n* Has better benefits (free food, better RTO policy)\n* Has less name recognition and isn't in an interesting field, IMO\n* Looks like it may have better WLB than my better gig, but not by much, and the startup does have busy oncalls \n\nFor reference, I'm... mostly happy with my current gig - it is very busy, but I am learning a good amount, have a good team and feel like I'm on path to get promoted by next year. The product I'm working on is somewhat interesting, but still better than what I would work on at this new startup.  \n  \n I am worried about layoffs in my current company (there has been some chatter about it happening next year) but nothing has happened yet, so I can't really make a decision on that. Another consideration is I'm on an open work visa, so though I can easily switch companies right now, sticking to my current big company may be safer later on if I need immigration support.\n\n**Issue 2: If I say no, how do I say no?**\n\nIDEALLY I would like to be on good terms with this company in case things turn south and I NEED to switch companies. I'm not sure what excuse to give here - I decided to stay because of promotions? Make up a raise or some other reasons? \n\nAlso, if I want to say no, I should say no NOW before meeting with the hiring managers, right? I think meeting up with HMs with no intention of joining is a bit too much, and I don't want to waste their time (interviews I don't mind because they probably do a ton of them anyway).\n\nThoughts?",

I have been working at the company for around 2 years now and accepted a low ball offer at the start to get myself into the field.\n\nI had no prior experience and I'm self taught so no degree.\n\nI accepted 39k to start with and have asked at the beginning of this year for a raise, I was told to reach certain goals that would push me closer to a mid Level from junior ( but I'm still within what the company has down as junior). I have taken on larger projects and I'm working a lot more and on much more complex tasks, leading small parts of the app.\n\nToday my team lead called me in for a meeting without telling me what it was about. It was a raise. \n\nI will be getting 1.5k extra a year. So about 3.7%. I never negotiated this raise, it was fine by my team lead for me with the manager of the mobile department.\n\nThis doesn't cover inflation over the last two years and I can't see myself getting another raise until I hit mid level, which I think would be coming in 2027 as a minimum. \n\nThe company also has new rules about raises in that, this year they need to be agreed upon before September and as of next year before June. So I'm waiting probably 1.5/2.5 years now for the next raise.\n\nI feel offended by such a small number especially as the average salary for a junior android dev in Berlin is closer to 45k.\n\nWe do however, get a bonus at the end of each year ( although it's not guaranteed that we will get it every year, and people seem to be questioning if we will get it this year or not) that caps out at 4k. After two years you get the full amount, so there is a chance I get this in December bringing me closer to 45, but I don't know if the bonus should count or not.\n\nShould I try to ask for a higher raise, what sort of number or percentage is even reasonable?\n\nUpdate: I've written to my team lead and asked to speak to him and the boss together to see if we can sort something out. I'm thinking to ask for a 15% raise, which will obviously be lowered but still hopefully work out higher.",
