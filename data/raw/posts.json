There’s also a path here for data analysts to move into data science, which pays better and involves predictive analytics and advanced modeling.\n\nThat used to be my plan, but lately I’ve realized I’m not sure it’s for me. I’m autistic and I struggle with the constant presentations, storytelling, and meetings that come with more “business-facing” roles.

I haven’t worked with Spark, IaC, or devops yet, but I like that kind of technical challenge.\n\nI’m not looking for advice per se, just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone here has had a similar experience, moving from a data or analytics-heavy background into something more engineering-focused.",

        "author": "GehDichWaschen",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nTLDR: The team prefers SSIS over Airflow, I want to convince them to accept the switch as a long term goal.\n\nI am a Senior Data Engineer and I started at an SME earlier this year.\n\nPreviously I used a lot of Cloud Services, like AWS BatchJob for the ETL of an Kubernetes application, EC2 with airflow in docker-compose, developed API endpoints for a frontend Application using sqlalchemy at a big company, worked TDD in Scrum etc.\n\nHere, I found the current setup of the ETL pipeline to be a massive library of SSIS Packages basically getting data from an on prem ERP to a Reporting Model.\n\nThere are no tests, there are many small-small hacky ways inside SSIS to get what you want out of the data. The is no style guide or Review Process. In general it's lacking the usual oversight you would have in a \\*\\*searchable\\*\\* code project as well as the capability to run tests on the system and databases. git is not really used at all. Documentation is hardly maintained\n\nEverything is being worked on in the Visual Studio UI, which is buggy at best and simply crashing at worst (around twice per day).\n\nI work in a 2-person team and our Job it is to manage the SSIS ETL, Tabular Model and all PowerBI Reports throughout the company. The two of us are the entire reporting team.\n\nI replaced a long-time employee that has been in the company for around 15 years and didn't know any code and left minimal documentation.  \n\nGenerally my colleague (data scientist) does documentation only in his personal notebook which he shares sporadically on request.\n\n\n\nSince my start I introduced JIRA for our processes with a clear task board (it was a mess before) and bi-weekly sprints. Also a Wiki which I filled with hundreds of pages by now. I am currently introducing another tool, so at least we don't have to use buggy VS to manage the tabular model and can use git there as well.\n\nI am transforming all our PBI reports into .pbip files, so we can work with git there, too (We have like 100 reports).\n\nAlso, I built an entire prod Airflow Environment on an on-prem Windows server to be able to query APIs (not possible in SSIS) and run some basic statistical analysis (\"AI-capabilities\"). The Airflow repo is fully tested, has Exception Handling, feature and hotfix branches, dev, prod etc. and can be used locally as well as on remote.\n\nBut I am the only one currently maintaining it. My colleague does not want to change to Airflow, because \"the other one is working\". \n\nFact is, I am losing a lot of time managing SSIS in VS while getting a lower quality system.\n\nPlus, if we ever want to hire an additional colleague, he will probably face the same issues as I do (no docs, massive monolith, no search function, etc.) and will probably not get a good hire.\n\nMy boss is non-technical, so he is not of much help. We are also not in IT, so every time the SQL Server bugs, we need to run to the IT department to fix our ETL Job, which can take days.\n\nSo, how can I convince my colleague to eventually switch to Airflow?\n\nIt doesn't need to be today, but I want this to be a committed long term goal.\n\nWriting this, I feel I have committed so much to this company already and would really like to give them a chance (preference of industry and location)\n\nThank you all for reading, maybe you have some insight how to handle this. I would rather not quit on this, but might be my only option.",

Was wondering if you guys clould tell me what a typical day at the “office” looks like for a DE? What tech stack is usually used. How much data transformation work is there to be done vs analysis. Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer. Appreciate you!",

I like that it feels more structured day-to-day, but I’d basically be starting from scratch learning it.\n\nWith just 16 months left and visa rules changing, I’m nervous about making the wrong choice.\nIf you’ve worked in either field, what’s your honest take on this?\n\nBased on my profile, i might struggle to land an entry-level ML job cos I only have one year of internship experience. I’d really appreciate your recommendations. I get that ML jobs are limited, so any guidance to navigate this would mean a lot.\n\nI’m confident I can put in the work necessary but the thought of my AI/ML internship experience going to waste if I switch to data engineering is scary.

The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. \n\nOur pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. \n\nEverything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. \n\nIs this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place? My job is such that I feel even after hours or on weekends im thinking of all the things I have to do. When I log into work these days I feel so groggy. ",

Additionally, why im saying my team is weird is because i have been doing research and been talking to otber teams. Lets just say only my team have ridiculous story pointings. They shout worklife balance and no need to work extra hours, but how can one finish their task without extras hours if workloads are just too much. \n\nHonestly, although i can push myself to be like them, i choose not to.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.\n\nFor example, in my setup:\n\nPostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial data\n\nMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)\n\nDuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasets\n\nFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.\n\nHowever, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**\n\nIs it mostly about:\n\nMaintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?\n\n**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data.

I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. \n1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). \n2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!\nThank you!",

I’m fairly new to data engineering, so I’m not entirely sure if this architecture is optimal, given that the data storage is decoupled from the query engine \\[any comments about how I'm handling the data and query engine will be more than welcome :) \\].",

Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. \n\nThese REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details.  To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. \n\n* I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. \n* I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app.   \n* I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome.   \n\nIdeally, the standalone app would be just a \"drag to Applications folder, click to open, and leave running,\"  but there are so many onboarding steps to ensure correct configuration,  MCP server setup, Claude MCP config setup, etc., that non-technical users will get confused after step #5. \n\nHas anybody here built a similar ETL product that can be distributed as a standalone app to non-technical users?

        "content": "Hi everyone;\n\nI need help from the community to classify my current position.\n\nI used to work for a small company for several years that was acquired recently by a large company, and the problem is that this large company does not know how to classify my position in their job profile grid. As a result, I find myself in a generic “data engineer” category, and my package is assessed accordingly, even though data engineering is only a part of my job and my profile is much broader than that.\n\nBefore, when I was at my small company, my package evolved comfortably each year as I expanded my skills and we relied less and less on external subcontractors to manage the data aspects that I did not master well. Now, even though I continue to improve my skills and expertise, I find myself stuck with a fixed package because my new company is unaware of the breadth of my expertise...\n\nSpecifically, on my local industrial site, I do the following:\n\n* Manage all the data ingestion pipeline (cleaning, transformation, uploading to the database, management of feedback loops, automatic alerts, etc.)\n* Manage a very large Postgresql database (maintenance, backup, upgrades, performance optimization, etc.) with multiple schema and broad variaty of data embedded\n* Create new database structures (new schemas, tables, functions, etc.)\n* Build custom data exploitation platforms and implement various business visualisations\n* Use data for modelling/prediction with machine learning techniques\n* Manage our cloud services (access, upgrades, costs, etc.) and the cloud architectures required for data pipelines, database, BI,… (on AWS: EC2, lambda, SQS, RDS, dynamoDB, Sagemaker, Quicksight,…)\n\nI added these functions over the years. I was originally hired to do just \"data analysis\" and industrial statistics (I'm basically a statistician and I have 25 years of experience in the industry), but I'm quite good at teaching myself new things. For example, I am able to read documentation and several books on a subject, practice, correct my errors and then apply this new knowledge in my work. I have always progressed like this: ir is my main professional strength and what my small company valued most.\n\nI do not claim to be as skilled an expert as a specialist in these various fields, but I am sufficiently proficient to have been able to handle everything fully autonomously for several years.\n\n **What job profile do you think would cover all these skills?** \n\n**=>** *I would like to propose a job profile that would allow my new large company to benchmark my profile* and realize that my package can still evolve and that I am saving them a lot of money (external consultants or new hires, I also do a lot of custom development, which saves us from having to purchase professional software solutions).\n\nPersonally, I don't want to change companies because I know it will be difficult to find another position that is as broad and intellectually so interesting, especially since I don't claim to know EVERY aspect of these different professions (for example, I now know AWS very well because I work on this platform on a day to day basis, but I know very little about Azure or Google Cloud; I know machine learning fairly well, but I know very little about deep learning, which I have hardly ever practised, etc.). But it's really frustrating to feel like you're working really hard, tackling successfully technical challenges where our external consultants have proven to be less effective, spending hundreds of hours (often on my own time) to strengthen my skills without any recognition and package increase perspective...\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n ",

As titled, am I Missing Hidden Costs/Tradeoffs?\n\nWe're a small shop, 5 data people, <10TB of production data.\n\nWe used to run our analytics in the production's read replica, but nowadays it always timed out / failed bcz of transaction conflicts.\n\nWe're storing a snapshot of historical data every day for audit/regulatory purposes (as pg dump and restoring it when we need to do an audit.\n\nWe're moving our data to a dedicated place. We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.\n\nBut we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  \n\nFor the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.\n\nWith either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshift\n\nWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \n\n\\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term.  \n\\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance  \n\\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.\n\nI'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it.  \nOn Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a query\n\nQuestion:\n\n1. Does this storage model make sense?\n2. Are there hidden compute costs? (from vacuuming/optimization)",

Security Compliance and Governance\n2. Managing State\n\nThe security component is actually already top of mind for governments and major enterprises who are concerned with \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks ([NIST.gov Report](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/what-post-quantum-cryptography), [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-quantum/)).

I've filtered their fact tables down to show only active jobs on our floor, and most of our reporting centers around that data. I built a Go ETL program that pulls data from Oracle and pushes it to Postgres every hour (currently moving about 1k rows per pull). My next step was to use dbt to build out proper dimensions and new fact tables.\n\n**Why the Migration?**\n\nThe company moved their on-premise Oracle database to Azure, which has tanked our Power BI and Excel report performance. On top of that, the database account they gave us for reporting doesn't have access to materialized views, can't create indexes, or schedule anything. We're basically locked into querying views-on-top-of-views with no optimization options.\n\n**Where I'm Stuck**\n\nI've hit a few walls that are keeping me from moving forward:\n\n1. **Development environment**: The dbt plugin is deprecated in IntelliJ, and the VS Code version is pretty rough. SqlMesh doesn't really solve this either. What tools do you all use for writing this kind of code?\n2. **Historical tracking**: The ERP uses object versions and business keys built by concatenating two fields with a `^` separator. This makes incremental syncing really difficult. I'm not sure how to handle this cleanly.\n3. **Dimension table design**: Since I'm filtering to only active jobs to keep row volume down, my dimension tables grow and shrink. That means I have to truncate them on each run instead of maintaining a proper slowly changing dimension. I know it's not ideal, but I'm not sure what the better approach would be here.\n\nYour advice would be appreicated. I dont have anyone in my company to talk to about this and I want to make good decisions to help my company move from the stoneage into something modern.\n\nThanks! ",

I was confused to impact if I delete some folders and files, I'm afraid go to break current ML flow or pipeline or tables on Databricks. \n\nand I'm thinking what if I connect and use data from Redshift to Databricks via direct connect for what i want data same as like Redshift on Databricks.\n\nwhich method are more suitable and any other expert advice can I get from you all\n\nI do really appreciate.",

        "author": "poogast",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.\n\nMy Goal:\nI want a containerized setup where:\n\n1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.\n2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).\n3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.\n4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.\n\nMy Current Architecture & Problem:\n\nI have the following containers working mostly independently:\n\n· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).\n· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.\n· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.\n· grafana: Connected to Trino.\n\nThe missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).\n\nThis is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.\n\nWhat I've Tried/Researched:\n\n· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.\n· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.\n· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.\n· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.\n\nMy Specific Question:\n\nIs the \"Hive Metastore in a container\" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.\n\n1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.\n2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?\n3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?\n\nAny advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!\n\nThanks in advance.",

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. \n\nRight now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.\n\nI guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be? I worked up a dashboard prototype using Chat GPT that I’d love to get some feedback on, if I get any interest on this post. I’d love to hear thoughts from people who work in this field!

        "content": "We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. \n\nTurns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. \n\nI searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. \n\nNow, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\n\n\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance  \n\\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector  \n\\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy  \n\\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them  \n\\- Directions for even further optimizations and learning\n\nHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search! \n\n[https://www.clarvo.ai/blog/optimizing-filtered-vector-queries-from-tens-of-seconds-to-single-digit-milliseconds-in-postgresql](https://www.clarvo.ai/blog/optimizing-filtered-vector-queries-from-tens-of-seconds-to-single-digit-milliseconds-in-postgresql)\n\nLet me know if there is anything I missed or if you have come up with better strategies!",

Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.\n\nI thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.\n\nHowever, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:\n\nIt’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.\n\nSmaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.\n\nLarger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.\n\n\nTheir suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.\n\nThat makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.\n\nHas anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?\n\nHow did you position yourself for it?\n\nAre there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?\n\nAnd lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?\n\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice.\n\nThanks in advance!",

All on the starter subscription.\n\nThen, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.\n\nWe are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!\n\nOk, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.\n\nWe already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.\n\nAnd to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.\n\nIs segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification?

        "author": "muskagap2",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I have a question regarding integration of Azure DevOps and VS Code for data engineering in Fabric.\n\nSay, I created notebook in the Fabric workspace and then synced to git (Azure DevOps). In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.\n\nAnd now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo. However, I don't know I how to convert .py to .ipynb to locally develop my notebook. And after that how to convert .ipynb back to .py to push it to repo. I don't want to keep .ipynb and .py in remote repo. I just need the update, final .py version in repo. I can't right-click on .py file in repo and switch to .ipynb somehow. I can't do anyhting.\n\nSo the **best-practice workflow** for me (and I guess for other data engineers) is:\n\nWork interactively in `.ipynb` → convert/sync to `.py` → commit `.py` to Git.\n\nI read that some use jupytext library:\n\n`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:light notebooks/my_notebook.py`\n\nbut don't know if it's the common practice. What's the best approach? Could you share your experience?",

        "author": "dRuEFFECT",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Principal Data Architect - this is the title my director and I originally threw out there, but I'd like some opinions from any of you. I've heard architect is a dying title and don't want to back myself into a corner for future opportunities. We also floated Principal BI Engineer or Principal Data Engineer, but I hardly feel that implementing Stitch and Fivetran for ELT justifies a data engineer title and don't feel my background would line up with that for future opportunities. It may be a moot point if I ever try going for a Director of Analytics role in the future, but not sure if that will ever happen as I've never had direct reports and don't like office politics. I do enjoy being an individual contributor, data governance, and working directly with stakeholders to solve their unique needs on data and reporting. Just trying to better understand what I should call myself, what I should focus on, and where I should try to go to next.\n\nBackground and context below.\n\nI have 14 years experience behind me, with previous roles as Reporting Analyst, Senior Pricing Analyst, Business Analytics Manager, and currently Senior Data Analytics Manager. With leadership and personnel changes in my current company and team, after 3 years of being here my responsibilities have shifted and leadership is open to changing my title, but I'm not sure what direction I should take it.\n\nBack in college I set out to be a Mechanical Engineer; I loved physics, but was failing Calc 2 and panicked and regrettably changed my major to their Business program. When I started my career, I took to Excel and VBA macros naturally because my physics brain just likes to build things. Then someone taught me the first 3 lines of SQL and everything took off from there.\n\nIn my former role as Business Analytics Manager I was an analytics team of 1 for 4 years where I rebuilt everything from the ground. Implemented Stitch for ELT, built standardized data models with materialized views in Redshift, and built dashboards in Periscope (R.I.P.).\n\nI got burnt out as a team of 1 and moved to my current company so I can be a part of a larger team, at first I was hired into the Marketing Department just focusing on standardizing data models and reporting under Marketing, but soon after started supporting Finance and Merchandising as well. We had a Senior Data Architect I worked closely with, as well as a Data Scientist; both of these individuals left and were never backfilled so I'm back to where I started managing all of it, although we've dropped all projects the data scientist was running. I now fall under IT instead of Marketing, and I report to a Director of Analytics who reports to the CTO. We also have 3 offshore analyst resources for dashboard building and ad hoc requests, but they primarily focus on website analytics with GA4.\n\nI'm currently in the process of onboarding Fivetran for the bulk of our data going into BigQuery, and we just signed on with Tableau to consolidate dashboards and various spreadsheets. I will be rebuilding views to utilize the new data pipelines and rebuilding existing dashboards, much like my last company.\n\nWhat I love most about my work is writing SQL, building complex but clean views to normalize/standardize data to make it intuitive for downstream reporting and dashboard building. I loved building dashboards in Periscope because it was 100% SQL driven, most other BI tools I've found limiting by comparison. I know some python, but working in that environment doesn't come naturally to me and I'm way more comfortable writing everything directly in SQL, building dynamic dashboards, and piping my data into spreadsheets in a format the stakeholders like.\n\nI've never truly considered myself an 'analyst' as I don't feel comfortable providing analysis and recommendations, my brain thinks of a thousand different variables as to why that assumption could be misleading. Instead, I like working with the people asking the questions and understanding the nuances of the data being asked about in order to write targeted queries, and let those subject matter experts derive their own conclusions. And while I've always been intrigued by the deeper complexities of data engineering functions and capabilities, there are an endless number of tools and platforms out there that I haven't been exposed to and know little about so I'd feel like a fraud trying to call myself an engineer. At the end of the day I work in data with a mechanical engineering brain rather than a traditional software engineering type, and still struggle to understand what path I should be taking in the future.",

Are there any gaps we'll find once we start using them?\n* Are snowflake roles easy to maintain via Terraform?\n* How best to use these tools to handle schema drift? I see dbt has an on schema change feature that can help with schema change by adding new columns and ignoring deleted ones. Does this work well? Is it best to use dynamic tables when landing data into Snowflake for the first time and then use dbt to move it to the data model?\n* I see some people use schema change but can dbt not do the same thing?\n* Terraform looks like it destroys and recreates objects but I have read we can set a flag to stop this on specific objects. Does this work well?\n\nThanks for any help",

        "author": "Salt_Anteater3307",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. \nThere is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.\n\nHere’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.\n\nThe process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:\nI would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.\n\nI would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.\n\nI tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.\n\nIn theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.\n\nSo here what I am wondering:\n\nHas anyone built something similar?\nDoes this approach scale?\nAre there proven practice for this that I might be missing?\n\nSo yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",

And every single job requires something drastically different.\n\nI dont really know how its possible. I have 3 YOE and spend most of my free time working with c++ to keep my knowledge up to date. In terms of technology, i have a very good understanding of DSP but thats about it. I cant imagine learning two or three additional leanguages to a very good level, as well as other technologies, and becoming proficient in each of them.\n\nAre people simply outstanding and know everything, or is their knowledge (and expected knowledge in job) is based on \"i heaard something, i read something, thats all, rest i will learn at job\"?",

I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",

But is that really necessary? \n\nJust check it once and you can be essentially sure that it'll work perfectly forever (until a vibecoder modifies it for some reason). After all there's no reason to change it now or ever.\nWon't unit tests be overkill for this?\n\nWhat about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?\n\nAnd if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.\n\nFinally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?\n\nthanks!",

You can look for explanatory videos for specific problems along the way.\"\n\nI find that to be an interesting perspective. I would like to know what others think about it.\n \nI've completed about 40% of the course and it's a long one.

I feel like I’m learning things temporarily, not really *understanding* them deeply.Yesterday hit me hard my mentor asked a simple question about something basic, and I just froze. I couldn’t answer. I felt so dumb and that moment made me question if I’m even cut out for this.But deep down, I **really love programming**. I love problem-solving, creating things, and the feeling when something finally works. I just don’t know how to move forward when I keep forgetting what I learn.\n\nIt hasn’t been long since I started, but I already feel like I’m behind everyone else. Should I restart from zero and rebuild my foundation? Or is there a better way to actually *retain* and *remember* things long term?If anyone here has gone through the same thing forgetting concepts, doubting yourself, feeling stuck how did you get through it?  \nWhat actually helped you improve your memory and confidence while learning to code?Any tips, motivation, or study habits would mean a lot. I really don’t want to give up on something I truly care about.\n\n Ps i forgot to mention that i enrolled a program but they are really in rush imagine in this 2 months  we already passing through front end dev and java script and also react / react js  and now  react native",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I finally caved and tried a split keyboard (NocFree lite, wireless version). Been two weeks and my wrists already feel a lot less strained during long coding sessions. My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices.  \n  \nThe layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing.  \n  \nBeyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys. I can even remap keys to control the mouse which is quite handy for my workflow (like scrolling or navigating code without leaving the keyboard). Hot-swappable switches mean I can tweak the typing feel over time without having to replace the whole board so I like the long-term use I’ll get out of it.  \n  \nOverall it has been a small change that’s actually improved my learning speed. Sharing it here for anyone curious about split boards. Those who already use one, how long did it take you to get used to the layout?",

        "content": "So I asked myself this question when I first watched a podcast with John Carmack. He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!\n\nWhen it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. \n\nI understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. \"Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away.\" \n\nI'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this? Could the complete opposite of googling everything be beneficial, i.e only picking a handful of resources and limiting yourself to that? ",

I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.\n\nI'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here.

        "content": "So for the past 2 years, I have been scripting/reading scripts and learning the basics of programming languages. In school, I learned basic R for Data Science courses, basic SQL for Data Management & Analysis, and basic Python for some general purpose programming. I really enjoyed my work in those classes, though at times I felt exhausted and stupid.\n\nNow I work as an Insurance Aide and most of my week consists of scripting/documentation somehow. I am now responsible for building an MS Access Reporting tool and using Excel, SQL, and VBA, and documenting our existing codebase for our \"applications\".\n\nWhile I enjoy my work, I recognize that working with VBA isn't what programming looks like in the typical sense of the word. I don't record macros, but there's a lot of abstraction in VBA and I feel like it's quite different from in depth programming work people do in python and other languages. I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues. I feel like I might like \"scripting\" instead of \"programming\", but I'm not even sure how to define the difference between the two, apart from how programming involves more technical memory allocation while \"scripting\" is the surface level \"do this do that\" of programming.\n\n  \nTL;DR: Do I like programming or scripting? And if I like scripting, what does that mean for my self-education journey (I'm currently re-introducing myself to Python)?\n\n",

        "content": "Hello. I'm a Junior Dev working mainly with Python.\n\nI've been asked to write a series of unit tests for a feature that I'm implementing on a project that I've worked on for a couple of months already.\n\nTo give some context. It's a microservice using a company-developed ORM. Each microservice inherit from a base class with a series of functionalities and the ORM itself. These microservices communicate with each other through a message broker.\n\nI need to write tests mainly for business logic and the ORM-related service layer queries. I’ve never written tests before, so I’ve been reading documentation and watching tutorials but most of the material I find is too basic and not fit for what I need.\n\nI've managed to write most of the tests for the business logic part, but I find it quite hard to do so for the ORM queries.\n\nThe main issue I'm facing is understanding how to effectively test ORM queries. Most examples I see online suggest using mocks with predefined return values, but I don’t really see the value in that.  \nIf I mock everything, I’m basically faking entire functionalities. So if after adding a new feature or refactoring code were to break, these tests would not detect it. So what am I testing?\n\nI feel like I'm testing the same things that I'm writing which doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI'd really appreciate some help on this. Thanks in advance! :)",

        "author": "Awkward-Carpenter101",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Context: As part of my self-study routine, alongside reading \\*The Algorithm Design Manual\\* by Skiena, I practice LeetCode problems. I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).\n\nI’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.\n\nWhen I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\n\n\\* Backtracking\n\n\\* Dynamic Programming\n\n\\* Memoization\n\nI can also identify the problem category:\n\n\\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\n\n\\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\n\n\\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)\n\nI’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best. I’d like to hear about your experiences and any advice that helped you overcome similar difficulties. Thanks!",

I've been looking at bootcamps like Coding Temple because I feel like I'd benefit from structured education, but I know a lot of people online are saying that you don't need bootcamps anymore, and can use sites like FreeCodeCamp. I don't care as much about the \"job guarantee\" factor because I understand the job market in most fields is very unstable right now. I'm 32 years old and looking for a career shift since I've spent the past two years applying to full-time film-related jobs with no success.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if doing a bootcamp can be worth it just for the discipline and structured learning, or if I'm much better off learning everything online. I'm also wondering if it's still worth it to learn coding/software development at all, because a lot of people are saying that it's virtually impossible to break into the industry unless you already have prior experience or know someone on the inside.\n\nWould appreciate any and all feedback on this, as I don't want to waste time or money before moving forward.

The layoffs in Irvine and San Diego, where Amazon has video game studios, include dozens of game designers and game artists.\n\nThis sheds some light on how affected SWEs were by this layoff in California at least.

But his manager once told him that his communication skills are a little off and he needs to work on that. He was okay with this initially and agreed to work on it but with the constant state of fear and overthinking he thinks this could be one of the deciding factor.\nThere are some new hires in his team..they’re young, confident, articulate..and he feels invisible next to them and assumes he’s automatically at risk.\n\nIt’s heartbreaking to see someone who’s great at what they do be this mentally wrecked by uncertainty.

Got in to a Mag7 company making around 200k with stock+bonus. Spent a few years there where i busted my ass working 50+ hours and got laid off this year. Got luck and found a new job at a big company that paid me more and now im around 230k with stock and bonuses. I moved when i gto my mag7 company and made some new friends. \n\nI dont usually discuss money wiht my friends but we were discussing bad finances with a friend where this friend make about 70k a year in a LCOL state but never seems to have money. Someone mentioned how it was due to her being poor, to which i said that i understand 70k isnt a lot but it's also not poor. You just gotta be careful with your money. Everybody looked at me weird, and one said \"well you make 150k+. You literally have never had to worry about money your whole career\". \n\nI just repsonded by saying that \"im licky to make what i make but just to let you know i didnt start making 6 figure until 3 years ago. I started off by making 74k and by my 4th year i was probably around 86k. All in a HCOL state and i sitll put enough for my retirement accounts. I lived under my means and saved enough extra money for any vacations i wanted. I lived wiht my parents and still had to pay them rent, though discounted I still had to pay 800 bucks a month in rent\". They all looked at me baffled that i ever made under 6 figures. One even said \"how dont you guys all make 150k out of college\". TO which i said no and had to explain job-hopping in our career and how most of the kids who make 6 figures out of college are going to big tech, FAANG, etc. ",

You can't be that guy being told what to do all the time.. now I need to take accountability for things and be the one to tell others what to do. But it's just so.. overwhelming man. Sigh.",

        "content": "I'm an ML Engineer with 6 YoE and a PhD for ML in Applied Math, based in the US. I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to \"unlimited\" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.\n\nFor the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.\n\nJust for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of \"R&D\" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.\n\nBut whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had \"unlimited\" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.\n\nEveryone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.\n\nAny advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad. Beyond that, if anyone has experience with this I'd like to hear about it so I can understand what to do / not to do.",

Did a bootcamp placement program which led to this startup role as an \"AI Dev.\" They labelled it as a senior role (despite me being a new grad) and emphasized using tools like Cursor and Chat as part of the workflow, which the company paid for. This was my first post-grad job.\n\nGot pulled aside this morning and was told \"today's your last day here,\" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting \"velocity,\" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.\n\nWas told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters. There seemed to be conflicting expectations between moving fast vs initial code quality between two of my authorities, and I often had difficulty getting timely support or permissions from the dev team.\n\nI'd love some advice moving forwards. I just relocated across the country for this job and have pretty limited savings and a year's lease to pay. The company offered a release agreement with small severance.\n\nI'm also not the first person to be let go from this role; another person was let go under a month ago for similar vague reasoning he also wasn't aware of. In any case, how might I proceed from here? Any hope for a new grad at this point in time?\n\nThank you!",

So idk if they just want cracked folks or I just fucked up\n\nI went through an interview process with a very small startup (less than 10 employees) in an industry I am new to. The interviews seemed to go really well. During the process, they mentioned there would be an initial probationary period of a few months, after which I’d need to relocate if both sides wanted to continue. They even had meetings with my references on top of the interview process.\n\nThe work is quite challenging and requires a strong understanding of cloud, networking, security, and a modern tech stack. They didn’t provide health insurance, but in our meeting they initially said they would pay for the cost if I purchased it myself. I received a non-formal offer via email sharing the good news and to discuss terms. Later, in the informal offer email, they claimed the quoted salary already factored in health insurance cost they claimed they'd imburse.\n\nBecause of my medical expenses and insurance needs, I asked humbly if there was any flexibility for a $10K increase in base salary, phrasing it as:\n\n*\"On base salary, I was hoping to see if there’s any flexibility toward $x\"*\n\nThe next day, I noticed my LinkedIn notification showed my resume had been viewed/downloaded again for that job I applied 2 weeks back. Then I received this email:\n\n*\"While working to finalize this, the founding team decided to take hiring for this position in a different direction. I realize this is not the answer you were anticipating, but want to get you a response as soon as possible to help guide your search process.\"*\n\nIn this tough market, where getting a job is extremely hard and I had submitted over 2,000 applications, I finally received an offer (not an official letter, just terms via email), and now it feels like I’ve lost the one opportunity I had.\n\nI’m wondering if they rejected me because of the $10K request, and if it’s normal for a company to back out this way during negotiations. I understand some companies have tight budgets, but isn’t the usual approach to say, “this is what we can provide” or “we can’t meet your proposal”?\n\nPart of me wants to believe they found a more senior candidate and it wasn’t my fault, but another part worries that I messed up by asking for more.\n\nWhat do you guys think could be what happened.

(Somewhat confident i'll find something in 6 months). Or take that internal position and be safe, loose that sweet severance work for some time and switch with position of power? \n\nI personally want to take severance but with this VISA limbo i'm super confused about what's better. \n\n  \nReally appreciate all your help/advice here. \n\n",

I've been there ~1.5 years now, and at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. Everyone on my team is kind, my manager is very supportive, and while WLB was rough, I thought I could manage it. \n\nI could care less about the work that I'm doing too, but that's probably the case for most people anyway. \n\nIn the beginning, I was performing well and received a promotion at the 1 year mark, but since then, it feels like my performance has quickly gone downhill. I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. \n\nI completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.\n\nAnd it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating. It's gotten so bad that I've been daydreaming about when I  worked retail jobs on night shifts during college (legitimately think that was more enjoyable for me than this job). \n\nI don't know if I'm just not built for a corporate job. The tight deadlines, horrible WLB, constant comparisons with coworkers, etc. All of it has been causing me so much stress, and my health has gone to hell this year because of it I think. Several days this month, I've just stared at my laptop screen, feeling like I physically could not do any work that day. \n\nI'm really frustrated with myself, because I grew up pretty poor and I think, if 12yo me knew I was complaining this much about a job paying me six figures, I'd punch myself in the face. \n\nI'm hoping I can get some advice from people who've felt similar:\n1. Am I just depressed or is my job really not a good fit for me? \n2. Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?\n3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? \n4. Also, can someone reassure me that moving to the middle of nowhere and becoming a hermit isn't actually a valid solution?",

The company is great, people are nice, pay for my area is pretty good, etc. I was offered to continue my internship part time through the school year and have continued working there ever since. Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where  I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. \n\nSide note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles. ",

        "content": "I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFor context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".\n> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThere were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

Every single day I discover something new (and usually critical) about the application I’m supposed to be developing — it’s overwhelming.\n\nI have a two-part question:\n\nHow can I become a better developer?\nI’ve learned a lot already, but I feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. The deadline pressure is insane, and it’s hard to balance learning deeply vs. just finishing the task. I want to focus on writing clean, well-structured code and truly understanding what I’m building, but the pace doesn’t allow it. Any tips on handling this phase better?\n\nHow do I know if I’m truly passionate about this field?\nBack in high school, I loved math and physics — genuinely. But I was sort of pushed into CS by my father. I don’t know if I regret it, because it’s given me a stable career path and I do enjoy Leetcode/problem-solving.

I don't have a senior, but there are a couple people doing dev works on different teams in the same building. \n\nMost of my work has felt like toy projects. I have mainly been responsible for tool development and data processing. Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).\n\nIt all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. \n\nThe point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff). I'm worried that I'm 'poisoning the well' by getting light dev experience without any guide. I am worried that I will essentially still be entry level as long as I stay here.

        "content": "Hello all, me again!\n\nSo….I’m like a little over a year in as a dev in my stack. I won’t lie, I relied heavily on ai to get my work done for the past year. This sprint I realized that for tasks I consider to be really complex, it’s even faster if I take baby steps and reason through it while using ai to fill any knowledge gaps or bridge my memory. But man… today I watched a senior do in an hour what I couldn’t do in five hours. And it wasn’t even his story, it was mine. He just reasoned through it and based off my explanations actually gave me a working solution to something that was really stressing me out. Like this was a story that our team considered max complexity points wise, but I’m still. Then I heard my manager talking about how I should be doing all my points and each point is like only a certain number of hours and how I should still have hours left over. I’m like, how can I know ahead of time how many hours a task will take me if I find things out mid sprint?\n\n\nAnd I’m like man… watching people do so effortlessly what takes me ages is honestly kinda painful. Like I almost shed a tear today because I was like “bro this is too much I can’t do this and the deadlines soon…” and I’m honestly tired of feeling stressed and angry over development work. And even if I end up with a working solution, it isn’t “clean”, like it isn’t up to par and my tech lead might just be like “redo this.” \n\nI get juniors have a learning curve. I get that. But it’s been a year. I had my old tech lead say 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you at this point” because I did a story incorrectly and he caught it near the end of the sprint. He always said I struggled or asked about simple things and give poor feedback to my manager on how I need to much help often.  I can’t remember what’s inside an object and how that object matches to this list with this key blah blah my brain just for some reason cannot reason through it like other people can.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where not only am I not taking a portion of the sprint for stories and a portion for whatever else like my manager expects, but I’m working at night, on weekends, I even sometimes would log in on a pto day to ask a question, and I’d often struggle to the point where it would feel like I get nothing done\n\nI just don’t know what’s going on or how to move forward with this. I never wanted to stay a dev, I always wanted to move to the business side, but I’m a dev now so I have to at least do the best I can in this role. \n\nI know I won’t stay a dev, but since I’m a dev now, what is going on here? Like, I just don’t understand what’s happening with me? Imposter syndrome or just not competent to do the work?\n\nBtw: I usually never cause carry over or defects, 95% of my stories are accepted. I’m just straight up not happy.\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "One of my first tasks ever was creating a script that moves folders around when a column of data (let's say C) changes. The manager who gave me the job told me that there was a rule that won't ever be broken at our company. That is column C will always be set to A or B and that we can use that logic to determine where to move folders to. Like an idiot I checked exactly A or B and didn't have any other checks. My manager was let go somewhere down the line and I completely forgot about this script. \n\n\nNot too long ago an office worker complained that they cannot find some of our files from their PC but they can through our site. So it turns out when you set column C to something other than A or B all of our projects that rely on the data still work (because I add a unique identifier file in each that we use to search instead of path thankfully) but internal office workers can't see it directly anymore because they were moved. Someone in leadership made the decision to expand the options for column C. Without my manager here to identify that went against the systems he had us design, they just went with it. \n\n\nSo what happens is if a row of data has certain settings and column C is changed to something other than A or B, an automation triggers the script that moves ALL related folders to an unrelated folder (that is not always the same as the last record). One instance was like 10 folders but another was like 10,000 folders. I.T. was able to move things back fairly quickly because we keep a history of movement but one guy was really mad because he thought one of the developers deleted some of our stuff. Dude was essentially yelling at me already when we didn't even fully know the cause yet. I at first didn't think it was related to us but after doing my research and finding the script, I realized it was me specifically so he was kind of right. I told them and fixed it of course. \n\nHow bad is this? I feel pretty bad because checking just A or B and not having a specific fallback and other checks to make is pretty egregious. I also am not a fan of getting yelled at. I also don't like the idea of defending myself by telling them to wait until we know for sure, and then confirming they were partially right. I should be sleeping right now to drive to work tomorrow but I can't sleep because I'm so bummed.",

Yesterday I found a bug and figured out the root cause and fix in minutes — but then spent the entire day figuring out how to implement it in SnapLogic. Tried docs, AI tools, trial-and-error… nothing. Finally got help from a SnapLogic dev in another team and he solved it in 15 minutes.\n\nOn top of that, this feels like a career-direction issue too.

Hiring freeze, no promotions, no roadmaps, and no opportunities for internal transfers since all open positions are now based in India. The general sentiment is that there’s little interest in the products my org develops and that we're considered too expensive, so our situation isn’t looking good. While the budget for next year is already allocated, there’s a real risk of layoffs starting in 2026.\n\nI’ve started exploring new opportunities, for fully remote roles. I mostly find openings at startups. European big tech have largely stopped offering full remote positions and are basically in hiring freeze, so the available roles are few and highly competitive. That said, I’m able to compete for positions at established startups, typically Series B or later, since I avoid earlier-stage ones due to the higher risk.\n\nMy dilemma is this: should I stay where I am, stagnant and without growth prospects, but hoping the rumors turn out to be wrong and my division gets a second chance? And in the meantime, maybe hope for a lucky break with an interview at another big tech? startup? Does it make sense to leave a big tech for the risk of being without work in two years for a startup that I imagine could fail anyway in the same timeframe?",

I’m having difficulty finding any students of the program and a quick search on LinkedIn found very little software engineers from that university.\n\nHowever, I chose it because it was the lease restrictive on its leveling course requirement, which would save me a year or two compared to other programs where it would take around five years including leveling courses vs versus 2 to 3 years at Concordia. I am getting tuition paid so that is not a concern.\n\nI have done Web Dev on my own time and made a To-Do program using react and all the basic building blocks before that in terms of technical skills, about 1 year of self learning experience. I have no education in computer science, and so I thought this message would at least show employers that I am worth hiring. \n\nWould it be a bad idea to do this masters program? I was thinking that while I’m doing the program that could provide some leverage in addition with my projects to get hired at an entry level role. And I’m hoping that it will give me a higher starting rate. I know the market is bad right now, but my timeline is about one to two years.\n\n",
