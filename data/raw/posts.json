        "content": "Hey all,  \nI just finished my Amazon Data Engineer Inter view loop recently (and got the offer ). Since I noticed a lot of outdated info online, thought I’d share how the process looked for me and what concepts are worth preparing. Hopefully this helps someone grinding through prep.\n\n**Process Overview**  \n**Recruiter Screen (30 min)**  \nRole fit + background discussion.  \nOne or two simple SQL/Python checks.\n\n**Technical Phone Screens (75 min each)**  \nMostly SQL and Python/ETL.  \nNot just solving, but also follow-ups on query optimization and edge cases.  \nEach screen also tested one Leadership Principle (LP) (mine were Dive Deep and Deliver Results).\n\n**Onsite / Virtual Loop (3–5 rounds, 60 min each)**  \nSQL Deep Dive → joins, windows, Top-K, rolling averages.  \nCoding / ETL Design → handling messy/late data, retries, streaming vs batch.  \nData Modeling → fact/dim schema, partitions, SCDs, trade-offs in Redshift/S3/Spark.  \nManager + Bar Raiser → critical rounds. Heavy mix of technical judgment + LPs. These carry a lot of weight in the final decision.\n\nLPs are central across all rounds. Prep STAR stories for Dive Deep, Deliver Results, Insist on Highest Standards, Are Right A Lot, Customer Obsession.\n\n**Concepts / Questions to Prepare**  \n**SQL**  \nWindow functions (ROW\\_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD).  \nComplex joins, CTEs, subqueries.  \nAggregations + grouping, rolling averages, time-based calcs.  \nGrowth/churn queries (YoY, MoM).\n\n**Python / ETL**  \nFlattening nested JSON/lists.  \nReal-time sliding window averages. Deduplication by key + timestamp.  \nBatch pipeline design with late data handling.\n\n**Data Modeling**  \nOrders/transactions schema with fact/dim and SCD for Prime status.  \nClickstream/session schema with partitions.  \nStar vs snowflake schema, warehouse trade-offs.\n\n**Leadership Principles (LPs)**  \nDive Deep: Debugging a broken pipeline under pressure.  \nDeliver Results: Handling a P0 deadline.  \nHighest Standards: Raising quality standards despite deadlines.  \nInvent & Simplify: Automating repetitive workflows.\n\n**My Takeaways**  \nAmazon DE evaluations are 50% technical and 50% LPs.  \nSQL/Python prep is not enough — LP storytelling is equally important.  \nManager + Bar Raiser rounds are the toughest and usually decide the outcome.\n\nThat’s my experience. If you’re preparing, don’t underestimate the LP side of it — it’s just as important as SQL/Python. Good luck to anyone with the process coming up\n\nTC : 261.5K\n\nBase : 171k\n\nRSUS : 190K\n\nSign on bonus year 1 : 81k\n\nSign on bonus year 2 : 60K\n\n\n\n\\#Amazon #DataEngineer #DataEngineering #BigData #SQL #Python #AWS #ETL #CareerGrowth",

I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.\n\nPerformance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.\n\nUsage-Wise, this is where I hate it.\n\nIt's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. \n\nPandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.\n\nToday I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.\n\nIt just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.\n\nI know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering \n\nI recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ called flash\\_hash\\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up to **2x faster** than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\\_hash\\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)\n\nThis post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.\n\n# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-Partitioned\n\nThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.\n\nThe industry-standard approach is the **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a \"divide and conquer\" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.\n\nHowever, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designed **Unpartitioned** concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.\n\nThe reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:\n\n1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.\n2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.\n\nI implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings: **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.\n\n# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for Speed\n\nWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:\n\n**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing**  \nThis is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.\n\n**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS**  \nTo allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution is **Shard Locking** (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash: lock\\_array\\[hash(key) % 2048\\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.\n\n**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator**  \nThe build-side hash table in a join has a critical property: **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: the **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly free—just a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminates malloc overhead and memory fragmentation.\n\n**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array**  \nA potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallel tag array of uint8\\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in the tag array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byte tag. Only if the tag matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.\n\n**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching**  \nThe probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I use **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to \"tell\" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process key i in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that key i+N (where N is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access:  \n\\_mm\\_prefetch((void\\*)&table\\[hash(keys\\[i+N\\])\\], \\_MM\\_HINT\\_T0);  \nWhile the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to key i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.\n\n**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing**  \nInstead of a generic library like xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions:\n\n    uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) {\n        uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB;\n        uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key);\n        return crc * ((k << 32) + 1);\n    }\n\nThe \\_mm\\_crc32\\_u32 is an **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse than xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.\n\n# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't Work\n\nNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few \"great\" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.\n\n* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensive **Gather** operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.\n* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win in **low-hit-rate** scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overhead—every key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.\n* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the \"grouping\" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe performance of flash\\_hash\\_join doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:\n\n* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.\n* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.\n* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.\n* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.\n* **Details**: Squeezing performance with tag arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.\n\nMost importantly, this entire process was **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out \"optimizations\" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.\n\nI hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.\n\nNote: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\\_efficient\\_hash\\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",

They have a historical data ingest tool that was designed for database to database change capture with other things bolted on. It's not a good fit for the current main product. \n\nThey have *another* internal python tool that a previous dev wrote to do the same thing (S3 CSV or flat file etc -> write to PG db). Then that dev left. Now the architect wrote a new open-source tool (up on github at least) during some sabbatical time that he wants to start using. \n\nNo one on the team really understands the two existing tools and this just feels like more not-invented-here tech debt. \n\nWhat's a good go tool that is well used, well documented, and has a good support community? \nFuture state will be moving to databricks, thought likely keeping the data in internal PG DBs.\n\nI've used NIFI before at previous companies but that feels like overkill for what we're doing. \nWhat do people suggest?",

It's fast for a one-off change, but it's a recipe for disaster.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on optimizing joins between two very large tables (hundreds of millions of records each) in a data lake environment. I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.\n\nBased on my research, here’s a quick summary of my understanding:\n\n* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.\n* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. It’s more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.\n\nMy main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.\n\nGiven this, I have a few questions for the community:\n\n1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?\n2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?\n3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?\n\nI'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation.

Local dev environment hot reloads with code changes, including local ClickHouse that you can seed with data from remote environment.\n\n**Links (no paywalls or tracking):**  \n**Guide:** [https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-powered-apis-in-react-app-moosestack](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-powered-apis-in-react-app-moosestack)  \n**Demo link:** [https://area-code-lite-web-frontend-foobar.preview.boreal.cloud](https://area-code-lite-web-frontend-foobar.preview.boreal.cloud/)  \n**Demo repo:** [https://github.com/514-labs/area-code/tree/main/ufa-lite](https://github.com/514-labs/area-code/tree/main/ufa-lite)\n\n**Stack**: Postgres, ClickPipes, ClickHouse, TypeScript, MooseStack, Boreal, Vite + React\n\n**Benchmarks**: front end application shows the query speed of queries against the transactional and analytics back-end (try it yourself!). By way of example, the blog has a gif of an example query on 4m rows returning in sub half second from ClickHouse and 17+ seconds on an equivalent PG.What I’d love feedback on:\n\n* Preferred CDC approach (Debezium? custom? something else?)\n* How you handle schema evolution between OLTP and CH without foot-guns\n* Where you draw the line on materialized views vs. query-time transforms for user-facing analytics\n* Any gotchas with backfills and idempotency I should bake in\n* Do y'all care about the local dev experience? In the blog, I show replicating the project locally and seeding it with data from the production database.\n* We have a hosting service in the works that it's public alpha right now (it's running this demo, and  production workloads at scale) but if you'd like to poke around and give us some feedback: [http://boreal.cloud](http://boreal.cloud/)\n\n*Affiliation note: I am at Fiveonefour (maintainers of open source MooseStack), and I collaborated with friends at ClickHouse on this demo; links are non-commercial, just a write-up + code.*",

Data from some core systems (ERP, PDM, CRM, ...)\n\n2. Data gets ingested to SQL Database through Azure Data Factory.\n\n3. Several schemas in dwh for governance (original tables (IT) -> translated (IT) -> Views (Business))\n\n4. What I then did is to create master data views for each business object (customers, parts, suppliers, employees, bills of materials, ...)\n\n5. I have around 20 scalar-valued functions that return \"Empty\", \"Valid\", \"InvalidPlaceholder\", \"InvalidFormat\", among others when being called with an Input (e.g. a website, mail, name, IBAN, BIC, taxnumbers, and some internal logic). At the end of the post, there is an example of one of these functions.\n\n6. Each master data view with some data object to evaluate calls one or more of these functions and writes the result in a new column on the view itself (e.g. \"dq\\_validity\\_website\").\n\n7. These views get loaded into PowerBI for data owners that can check on the quality of their data.\n\n8.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to get some feedback from people who work with databases and data pipelines regularly.\n\n# The Problem\n\nIn a lot of real-world projects (especially data migrations, warehouse integrations, or working with client-provided dumps), I often receive a set of **database tables with only column names and maybe some sample data — but no ERD, no constraints, no documentation**.\n\nFor example:\n\n* I might get 50–100 tables dumped from SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.\n* Columns have names like `cust_id`, `c_id`, `customerID`, `fk_cust` spread across tables.\n* Foreign key constraints are either missing or never set up.\n* Sometimes I also get a CSV or JSON with sample data, but that’s it.\n\nManually figuring out how these tables connect is time-consuming:\n\n* Which `id` in one table maps to which column in another?\n* Which columns are just lookups vs. actual relationships?\n* Which ones are “fake” similarities (like `code` columns that don’t really connect)?\n\nI end up doing a mix of manual joins, searching for overlapping values, and asking business users — but it’s not scalable.\n\n# My Approach (experimental)\n\n1. **Column Name Matching:** Use fuzzy string matching (manually) to catch things like `cust_id` ≈ `customerID`.\n2. **Data Overlap:** Sample distinct values from columns and see if they overlap (e.g., 70% of values in one column appear in another).\n3. **Weighted Confidence:** Combine name similarity + overlap + datatype compatibility into a score (e.g., strong match if name & overlap both high).\n4. **Visualization:** generate a graph view (like a partial ERD) that shows “probable” relationships.\n\nIt’s not 100% accurate, but in testing I can get \\~60–70% of relationships guessed correctly, which is a good starting point before manual validation.\n\n# My Question to You\n\n* How do *you* usually solve this problem today when no documentation or foreign keys exist?\n* Do you rely on scripts, BI tools, schema crawlers, or just manual detective work?\n* If you had such a tool, what features would make it actually useful in your day-to-day (e.g., synonym dictionaries, CSV upload, integration with ERD tools, etc.)?\n* Do you see this as a real pain point, or just an occasional annoyance not worth automating?\n\nI’d really appreciate your insights 🙏 — even if your answer is “we don’t face this problem often.”",

There's also a paid version that makes nice reports for manager-types. \n\n\n\nFair warning: I built this based on reading failure stories, not from being a RAG expert.

        "content": "**TL;DR**\n\n* nexos.ai provides unified dashboard, real-time cost alerts, and sharable assistants.\n* Langfuse is extremely robust and allows deep tracing while remaining free and open-source and you can either self host it or use their Cloud hosting.\n* Portkey is a bundle with gateway, routing, and additional observability utilities. Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.\n* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.\n\n**Why did I even bother writing this?**\n\nI found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldn’t find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, I’ve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n**nexos.ai**\n\nQuick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.\n* Cost alert messages, so we don’t blow our budget in a week.\n* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.\n* It has an API gateway.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.\n\n**Langfuse**\n\nQuick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.\n* The A/B testing feature is awesome.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* It’s open-source, so we’ll see how it goes.\n\n**Portkey**\n\nQuick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.\n* Robust logging features.\n* Dev-centric UI.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.\n\n**Arize Phoenix**\n\nQuick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Slack alerts are super convenient.\n* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.\n\n**Overall**\n\nI feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai. It’s just all there available out of the box, with the observability, management, and guardrails menu providing the exact feature set we were looking for. \n\nClose second for me is Langfuse due to its open-source nature and good documentation coverage.",

I like it but definitely don't love it / have a passion for it.\n\nAt this point, I'm heavily considering pivoting into sales of some sort, ideally software. I have good social skills and outgoing personality and people have always told me I'd be good at it. I know Software Sales is a lot less stable, major lay-offs happen from missing 1 month's quota, first couple years I'll be making \\~$80k-$90k and is definitely more of a grind.

It doesn't seem to play to my strengths and kind of lacks excitement and energy imo.\n\n1. Do you see any opportunities for those with data analytics to break into a good sales role/company without sales experience?\n2. Data Science salary seems to top out around $400k, and thats rather far along in a career at top tech firm (I know FAANG pays much more). While, Sales you can be making $200K in 4 years if you are top. Does comp continuously progress from there?\n3. Has anyone made a similar jump and regretted it?\n\nAny words of wisdom or guiding advice would be appreciated.",

I’m not completely unprepared for the role as I used a lot of SQL as a financial analyst building power BI dashboards for them, and I think I will be doing a lot of the same work in this team when I start. The base salary starting is 68k a year and from what I understand that is fairly low but considering I don’t have a comp sci degree I figured it is pretty fair, but if anyone thinks I’m getting boned let me know. I’m sure I would get a increase in pay if I show a lot of growth in the field but my idea is that they also may think I might just transition to a finance team as soon as I can (which is very possible). Looking forward to your guys more informed perspective, thanks!\n",

Glean however is very expensive so I searched around for an open source self-hosted alternative. Onyx seems like the closest thing that we can self host for probably 100 a month instead of thousands per month like Glean would be. Does anyone have experience with Onyx? For context we would probably be hosting it in GCP for 100-200 users with a couple gigs of documents that should be easily handleable by basic pdf processing. Mostly just want to understand how much time it takes to set up self hosting, set up a few connectors and google oauth, as well as how high quality the search and response generation is.",

The current architecture looks like this: I have some scheduled python jobs that scrape the data, raw data lands on S3 partitioned by hours, then data is processed and clean data lands in a Postgres DB with Timescale enabled (I'm using TigerData). Then the data is served through an API (with FastAPI) with endpoints that allow to fetch historical data etc.\n\nEverything works as expected and I had fun building it as I never worked with Timescale. However, after a month I have collected already like 1 TB of raw data (around 100 GB on timescale after compression) . Which is fine for S3, but TigerData costs will soon be unmanageable for a side project.\n\nAre there any cheap ways to serve time series data without sacrificing performance too much? For example, getting rid of the DB altogether and just store both raw and processed on S3. But I'm afraid that this will make fetching the data through the API very slow. Are there any smart ways to do this?",

I'd imagine it's a common problem, how do you prevent being overwhelmed by failure notifications and instead get a single, aggregated email per DAG run?

Other people in my team do not have almost any data engineering expertise and limited software engineering experience.\n\nWe have a bunch of simple Python ETL scripts, getting data from various sources to our database. Now they are running on crontab on a remote server. Now I suggested implementing some CI/CD practices around our codebase, including creating a CI/CD pipeline for code testng and stuff. And my teammates are now suggesting that we should run our actual Python code inside those pipelines as well.\n\nI think that this is a terrible idea due to numerous reasons, but I'm also not experienced enough to be 100% confident. So that's why I'm reaching out to you - is there something that I'm missing? Maybe it's OK to execute them in ADO Pipeline?\n\n(I know that optimally this should be run somewhere else, like a K8s cluster, but let's say that we don't have access to those resources - that's why I'm opting with just staying in crontab).",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Morning everyone,\n\nLike many of you, I've been trying to properly integrate AI and coding agents into my workflow, and I keep hitting the same fundamental wall: agents call `Rscript`, creating a new process for every operation and losing all in-memory state. This breaks any real data workflow.\n\nI hit this wall hard while working in R. Trying to get an agent to help with a data analysis that took 20 minutes just to load the data was impossible. So, I built a solution, and I think the architectural pattern is interesting beyond just the R ecosystem.\n\n**My Solution: A Client-Server Model for the R Console**\n\nI built a package called `MCPR`. It runs a lightweight server inside the R process, exposing the live session on the local machine via `nanonext` sockets. An external tool, the AI agent, can then act as a client: it discovers the session, connects via JSON-RPC, and interacts with the live workspace without ever restarting it.\n\n**What this unlocks for workflows:**\n\n* **Interactive Debugging:** You can now write an external script that connects to your running R process to list variables, check a dataframe, or even generate a plot, all without stopping the main script.\n* **Human-in-the-Loop:** You can build a workflow that pauses and waits for you to connect, inspect the state, and give it the green light to continue. \n* **Feature engineering:** Chain transformations without losing intermediate steps\n\nI'm curious if you've seen or built similar things. The project is early, but if you're interested in the architecture, the code is all here:\n\n**GitHub Repo:**[https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR](https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR)\n\nI'll be in the comments to answer questions about the implementation.

Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. \n\nIf only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. \n\nAgain I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that that’s just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so it’s like an early prevention mechanism. I’m thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. \n\nI realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if it’s just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. I’ll sleep more peacefully.\n\n——Technical Questions——\n\nApp: \n1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?\n2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.\n3. How ”simple” will this app be? I’m not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.\n\nFlood detection:\n1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?\n2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?\n\nGeneral:\n- Is this possible? How long will this take me? \n\nNB: I’m gonna fund this entirely on my own and I’ll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.\n\nObviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly don’t know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM. \n\nThank you in advance.\n",

None of them really knew programming... and the guy they hired to lead it is gone. Because of that, I (and some fellow interns who are game developers) were tasked to increase the performance of the project. Naturally I inquired about their Github first and as a response I heard their Github was \"broken\". I initially thought going back a few pushes would fix it... but when I asked for more details it wasn't necessarily that their Github was broken... rather that they didn't have one.\n\nThey didn't work with Github.\n\nThe entire project was made and maintained on literally. A single. Computer.\n\nNow, I'm not a software god by any means, far from it, but I'm fairly certain Github is necessary for working with multiple people. I've learned 2 issues. The first one being that Github doesn't accept files larger than 100mb, and I'm currently learning how to work with Github Large Files to remedy that issue, as well as testing which files I can delete that won't even affect the project. However the second problem is that Github doesn't accept repositories larger than 5Gb? Mine is about 17Gb...\n\nI've already been looking up on reddit and Stackoverflow for advice but it seems that not many run into a problem like this. If anyone can share any thoughts with me would be highly appreciated.",

We had to write our own code in that class based on established projects. I've also attempted far more complex projects based on tutorials meant to walk through nearly every step. In total, I've spent maybe 40-60 hours trying to code with C# and Java depending on the project. But to be completely honest, if you asked me to make something as simple as a calculator, I literally wouldn't even be able to tell you what the first WORD in that code would be. For some reason my brain has absorbed absolutely NOTHING about syntax or even setting up projects, and it's extraordinarily frustrating. Every tutorial or class I've ever done, I have actually been typing out all code used, and yet NOTHING sticks in my brain. I glean loose concepts, but the languages themselves leave no impression on me, and I have no idea if this is normal or not. I'm 22. If I literally can't even code \"Hello World\" for the 30th time in C# or Java because I don't remember the syntax or formatting, should I just give up trying to learn by myself (as opposed to enrolling in an in-person program)? Is coding even for me? \n\nTo clarify: I understand and have learned a lot more about how code works in those 40-60 hours. The issue is the language has no place in my brain. If I am asked to code by myself, I could tell you the general concept of what I'd need to do, and that's it. The code itself, the actual words and their order, I couldn't tell you if you put a gun to my head.",

Whenever I have done any project, I tend to either use one language and its framework. In the case of Java for example, I use Springboot and Kafka (With some basic bootstrap for the frontend) and JavaFX for the graphic interface.\n\nBut with all of these languages how can I use them for a project? I know python tends to be used for scrypting or for AI integration but I have not delved into that nor I have had the need.\n\nTo those that were in this situation or those that are in it, how do you tend to maximize/add other languages into your project? I do not say this for the sake of making things more difficult, I simply want to find a way in which I can make better projects or find a better value of what I'm learning. I fear that this year it might end up being a year in which I won't be able to do any real advancements because I will have to keep studying keywords, libraries and such instead of making actual projects that get you somewhere.\n\nEDIT: I have to study it because the classes this year demands it, my intention was to mostly stick with one until I feel that I'm more of an expert with it",

It’s not that I’m particularly interested in C itself, but I do want to get better at coding in general.\n\nMy question is:\n\nAfter finishing this C book, should I keep going deeper into C, or should I move on to another language?\n\nWhat programming languages should I learn after C if my main goal is to improve my coding skills?\n\nAre there languages that are both good for learning and getting better at coding while also being useful for getting a job in the future?\n\nI’m currently considering either Python or C++ as my next language, Python because everyone recommends it to beginners, and C++ because it builds on C and includes all of C.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just started studying software engineering at university, but I’m feeling conflicted and unsure about the future. Most of my friends who enrolled in this program have already left, and I’m one of the few still sticking with it.\n\nHere’s my situation:\n\n* I’m 21 and just starting my degree. If all goes well, I’d finish in about 3–4 years.\n* At my university in Canada, internships are mandatory. Without them, you can’t graduate. The school provides some help, but it’s still hard to find one — for some people, it takes 6+ months or even a year.\n* I’m married, and I really want to finish as quickly as possible so I don’t make my wife wait longer than necessary.\n* On a personal note, my mother passed away this past January from a brain tumor. Before she passed, I wanted her to see me married, so I made that choice out of love for her and my wife. I know I have to carry the responsibility of that decision, but I don’t regret it.\n\nLooking ahead, I’d like to specialize in AI ,specifically deep learning and machine learning. I know that’s a path that might require pursuing a master’s degree or additional studies after my bachelor’s.\n\nAnd about passion, people often say “if you’re not passionate, switch programs.” I’d say I am passionate, but in my own way. What I really love is solving problems, whether it’s in math, physics, or programming. Coding itself is fun, but I’m not the type who will stay up all night coding just for the sake of it. For me, the thrill is in figuring out the solution.\n\nSo far, I’ve only done one or two very small side projects, and I’m starting a third one (a bit harder, I want to make a simple GPT wrapper). They’re nothing big, but I’m slowly building up.\n\nMy concern is: should I stick with software engineering?\n\nBy the time I graduate, will it still be worth it? Or is the field going to be so saturated that even with a degree and internships, finding a job will be tough?\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation,  balancing marriage, studies, and an uncertain job market? Do you think staying in software engineering is a good idea, or should I start reconsidering now before I go too far down this path?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

I found out that I can store integers as bytes in a text file and the file when opened in a text editor will have those bytes translated to their ASCII characters but Godot will still read the data as bytes and return integers when the program reads the file.\n\nI thought it’d be funny to have a simple text file, not .dat or .json or any other specialized data storage format, for storing data. Because the text editor spits out the ASCII codes, it will look like gibberish. Representing the data I need stored as integers is easy. The problem is that I’m not sure how to separate different pieces of information. Let’s say variable A is an integer. Simple. Store its binary 8 bit value. Let’s say variable B is an array. Well it could be of a varied length so I need some way to tell the program when it’s reading the file that the data for this variable starts here and ends here. I can’t use any of the 256 combinations of 8 bits because they all represent numbers that the value I’m trying to store could be.\n\n**So how can I mark the beginning and end of certain pieces of data in bytes?** I’m sure this is a very basic computer science problem but I’m not proficient enough in Google-fu to find it online.",

But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.\n\nEven when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.\n\nThis year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soon\nRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.\n\nI might be spiraling \n\nMy question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost \n\nI really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",

At first I thought it was just a puzzle game with logic gates… but it turned out to be much more. It gave me a hands-on understanding of logic gates, memory, and even simple CPU design. Hats off to devs for making something so educational yet so enjoyable.\n\nThe game gradually pushes you from simple combinatorial circuits, to memory, to registers and to building a working CPU (LC-3 style) with your own instruction set. By the end you’re basically writing assembly for a custom ISA that you designed yourself.\n\nI’m not a computer engineer by training, but the concepts I picked up while playing \\[logic gates, adders, memory, instruction cycles and more\\] have been incredibly specific and useful later on. They gave me intuition that still helps me today as I'm trying to study C, data structures, and operating systems.\n\nIt’s obviously not a replacement for textbooks, but for me it was a fantastic way to *feel* how computers work at a very low level, and it made the transition to more formal books study way smoother.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has tried it and how far you got — did you stop at logic gates, or did you programmed your CPU?",

My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement.

From what I’ve seen, Go related roles are quite limited and often target senior/lead engineers (likely for teams migrating to Go). Because of this, I’m considering shifting to Java for backend work, since it seems to have a much broader job market.\n\nAt the same time, I’m also tempted by C++. There aren’t many developers specializing in low-level coding, and I feel that makes it a valuable skill in the long run. On top of that, I really enjoy thinking about systems, hardware, and OS-level concepts (not recommend assembly :) ), though I have very limited knowledge since I don’t come from a CS background. This makes me wonder if transitioning to C++ would be worth compared to Java.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences, whether it’s about job market trends, learning paths, or the trade-offs between going deeper into Go, switching to Java, or investing in C++.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Here and there some Javascript.\n\nNow I got my first Junior job as a developer (not in Game Development) and they use so many different concepts and functions I never saw and tools like PowerShell, languages like Python and frameworks like Node and .NET I never used as well. It kinda seems that they expect that I know all of these even though that wasnt mentioned in the job offer or in my CV. Now I feel like I am not good enough for the position and therefore I wanna strengthen my skills. \n\nI already did some courses on platforms like codecademy and codedex but it is still completely different compared to real use. I know people say that I need to do my own projects but at the end of the day it is \"copying\" from AI/forums/YouTube tutorials. I couldn't do much from scratch.\n\nSo my question is: How do I get better and \"impress\" my colleagues? I know basic stuff like data types, loops, methods, OOP and other stuff but not much in detail. I am also able to read code (of things I saw) well and understand it but do it myself? Kinda hard.\n\nI would appreciate every kind of Help.\n\nBest regards!",

Looking back, I can see the idea probably didn’t sound very impressive the way I explained it. He said:\n\nI should add AI integration. And more importantly, he told me: *“Web development is dead. You should switch to mobile development. It would be better for you. Everybody knows web dev\"*\n\nNow I’m stuck. I know I wasted so much time, but I want to at least use these last months to learn and build something. My main question is: is web development really “dead” and not worth doing anymore?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and you’re trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):\n\n1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).\n2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.\n3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.\n\nContext: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.\n\nQuestions I struggle with repeatedly:\n\n1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\n**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly). Or is this trial-and-error method the only way to learn?",

        "content": "Hey, I’m a 2nd year Compurer Science student and my studies already take up a ton of time and energy. Most of my day is basically just me sitting behind my laptop grinding through uni work so I can keep my grades up.\n\nAt the same time, I also have the ambition to build my own projects, either to make money from programming or at least to create tools that are genuinely useful to me. The problem is I haven’t even managed to start a project yet. I struggle with discipline and time. After a full day of studying, my brain just feels fried, and at that point I usually need to do something physical instead. I’m pretty active and I love sports, so I go to MMA once a week and try to squeeze in short workouts on other days. Honestly, without sports I’d probably go crazy.\n\nAnother factor is that I still live at home. My family expects me to spend a lot of time with them, helping out aroud the hosue, hanging with my sibling, etc. I feel guilty if I ignore them, so usually when I get back from uni I end up just chilling in the living room instead of working on a personal project. On top of that, my little brother has been sick for a few years and can’t really leave the house, so he needs more of my time and energy too. I hope he gets better soon, since that would have a good impact on both our lives.\n\nI’m the type of person who really likes having structure and a routine, so part of me feels like moving out nearby could help me manage my time better. But then that also makes me feel guilty for “leaving” my family.\n\nMeanwhile, one of my classmates (and a good friend) has the same ambitions as me, but his routine is very different. After studying all day, he takes break at home, then spends the rest of the evening grinding on a personal project until he goes to bed. He basically lives on his own, doesn’t care much for sports, and spends almost all his time in front of a screen. I can see it working for him, he’s making progress and hitting his goals,  but I also suspect it’s taking a toll on his health. Still, I can’t help but compare myself to him and admire his discipline.\n\nSorry for the info dump, but I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone has advice on how to balance studies, family, health, and personal projects, I’d really appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if people got drop some project ideas or just routes i can take. I only looked into automating stuff in my live. But maybe there are far more intersting usefull and lucrative ideas (altho i doubt people would tell this one if they know it :))",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey r/learnprogramming,\n\nI've been using Rust for a while and recently finished a project that involved some interesting challenges I thought would be valuable to share, especially for those curious about using Rust with other languages.\n\n\n\n# ## The Goal\n\n\n\nIn my field (bioinformatics), there's a powerful C++ tool called `odgi` for working with complex DNA data. I wanted to use its features inside a Rust program to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency, which meant building a bridge between the two languages.\n\n\n\n# ## The Learning Journey & Key Challenges\n\n\n\nEven with experience, this project presented some great learning opportunities:\n\n1. **Tackling FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** The core of the project was making Rust and C++ talk to each other. I used the `cxx` crate, which is a fantastic tool for generating safe bindings. It was a deep dive into how to manage data and function calls across the language boundary, which is a common task in systems programming.\n2. **Designing a \"Safe\" API:** A key principle in Rust is memory safety. A big part of the design work was creating a public API that completely hides the `unsafe` FFI calls. This ensures anyone using my library can write 100% safe Rust code, a rewarding design challenge.\n3. **Complex Build Scripts:** I had to write a [`build.rs`](http://build.rs) script to compile the entire C++ `odgi` library from source before building the Rust code. It's a good reminder of how complex real-world build pipelines can get when you're integrating different ecosystems.\n\n\n\n# ## The Outcome\n\n\n\nThe result is a library (`odgi-ffi`) that other Rust developers in my field can now use as a solid foundation for their own tools.\n\n\n\n# ## Key Takeaways\n\n\n\n* **Real-world problems push your skills:** Integrating existing, complex libraries is a great way to move beyond language basics.\n* **Modern tooling makes hard problems accessible:** FFI used to be a very manual and error-prone process. Crates like `cxx` make it significantly more manageable and safe.\n\nI just wanted to share the experience in case it's helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, or about using Rust and C++ together.",

But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThis is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\n\n\\---\n\nIf current\\_frame == 1: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_1 on screen\n\nif current\\_frame ==2: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_2 on screen\n\n\\---\n\netc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.\n\nI'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.\n\nThis may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals.

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\n\nUltimately, I want to understand enough Python to use tools like Codex effectively, though I might take things further if I end up really enjoying it.\n\nThanks!\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m working on an application that needs to communicate with a **biometric fingerprint sensor**. Right now, I only know **JavaScript**, so the most natural solution for me seems to be **Electron JS** for building a desktop app.\n\nHowever, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Is Electron really **suitable** for this type of app that requires direct hardware access?\n2. Or would it be better to learn **Java**, **Python** (I’m starting to learn it), or even **C++** to have more control over the sensor?\n3. I’ve read that even with Electron, you often need a **backend in Python or another language** to act as a bridge between the app and the hardware. Is this really necessary, or can Electron handle it alone?\n\nI’m looking for the **most practical solution** for someone who already knows JS but is willing to learn another language if needed.",

Are these projects enough for a fresher-level job in web development?  \n2. What additional skills should I focus on learning next (e.g., Next.js, DevOps basics, system design)?  \n3.

But the real outcome for me was how much I learned while building it.\n\nHere are a few screenshots and a link if anyone’s curious:\n\nFind here : [https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shared/id6748949959](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shared/id6748949959)\n\nI’m still improving it and would be glad to hear any feedback, but mainly I wanted to share how working on a concrete project really accelerated my learning compared to just reading docs or watching tutorials.",

If you were given the chance to solve the problem alone, you’d ace it. But in the context of the interview, your mind goes blank and you make mistakes that you’d never otherwise make. \n\nThe whole experience makes you feel like maybe you don’t actually know what you thought you knew. You’re drowning in the cringe of claiming to know how to code, and then bombing in front of people who are there to determine your employment worthiness. It messes with your head. ",

Extra rent costs, electricity costs, harder to hire themselves. Well it does, but less than their employees switching around so easily. The big companies are evenmoreh hell bent on RTO because they know they'll always have people willing to interview for them. \n\nIt's similar to how companies give very low hikes and risk employees leaving them. Sure they make a loss on the people who switch but they bet on most people *not* switching than switching. \n\nThis plan gets foiled when employees are at home and can easily interview at their homes. \n\nEdit: Of course people switch even with wfo but it's much harder. Also it's a factor, not the sole reason. Getting people to resign on their own, pre signed leases, managers just being picky are reasons too. ",

What really matters for hiring is personality because the company can train you in the rest.\n\nHonestly, that crushed me for a while.

You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.\n\nThere are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\n* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.\n* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.\n* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.\n* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.\n* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always “high salary” in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.\n\nI think tech gets the spotlight partly because\n\n1. It’s more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people “get” what a software engineer does\n2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those “Day in the Life” vlogs\n\nMeanwhile, most law firms or finance offices aren’t putting out lifestyle videos showing their perks\n\nCurious what others think: is it just the marketing or social media presence, or is there something unique about tech culture that makes people talk about salaries and perks more than other fields?",

My team is developing a brand new product for the company which is pretty exciting, but that also means there’s risks.\nThe product could flop, maybe the culture shifts once its released and we are supporting client, or maybe the product gets cancelled, i get laid-off, and my resume shows me working on some zero impact project. The work is pure Java with some Vertx.\n\nA recruiter reached out to me about a role i was previously rejected on. Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:\n130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)\nThe catch is it’s 4x a week in office and currently a 30-45 minute commute to the most touristy part of the city. The company had a recent round of layoffs as well so im not sure if it’s really the much more stable apart from the product being more mature.\n\nObviously, i’d feel bad leaving a company within a few months especially one that i really like, but is it dumb to pass up such a pay raise?\n\nAny advice or additional considerations is welcome.",

Everyone is offshore except for me.\n\nThe issue is that we’re about a month into this new project (we all got onboarded at the same time since we’re taking over from an outbound team) and everyone on the team seems lost. As a junior, isn’t my job to be learning from everyone else and working on small tasks here and there? Instead, I just led a 4 hour bridge call the other night at 11pm by myself for a critical incident. Everyone on the team keeps asking me questions, including our team lead who, to be blunt, appears to be technically incompetent. It feels like no actual work gets done unless I prod people and help them out to get things moving along. On top of that, the team lead dumps his tickets on me when he finds out he has no idea how to do it. Now I’m not gonna say I’m a 10x dev or anything, but at the bare minimum shouldn’t these guys have a better grasp of the project from the KTs than me?\n\nMy manager is always busy since he’s dealing with 2-3 other teams so he’s not aware of this (I also haven’t brought it up). Has anyone else dealt with something like this? I feel like I’m not growing since there’s nobody to learn from, and it doesn’t feel right to be acting as a team lead when I’m the most junior person. I’m pretty frustrated with the whole situation and I’m not sure what the solution is.",

        "content": "The way I learnt to code was kind of backwards. I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C. For most of my coding \"life\", I just wrote everything in asm, and then later on C but still mostly asm because I found everything else kind of confusing. I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),\n\nThis kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the \"low-level\", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.\n\nNow I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.\n\nI struggle to use git lol\n\nCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusing\n\nI struggle with database stuff\n\nI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own \"OOP\" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.\n\nGet fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shit\n\nAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool \"high level\" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.\n\nIt's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.\n\nNone of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).\n\nNone of these things are \"software\" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).\n\nTo be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.\n\nAny insights or advice is much appreciated.",

I would always work on side projects and was always down to jump on random startup ideas with good friends where I would only handle the tech stuff. I never really did this stuff to make money (of course I always hoped that it would pay off each time) but simply for the love of the game. I genuinely think me building all these websites in the past taught me a lot and turned me into a really good engineer. Now, I'm in your typical big tech company making 250k.\n\nThe other day, a friend reached out with an idea for a tool. The idea makes sense to me and doesn't sound too difficult to build. He also has a pipeline to market it and already some validation so I would only have to handle the tech stuff so I immediately told him I'm down.\n\nHowever thinking about it after, I'm wondering if it's the smartest thing to do. I like to think that I'm good at what I do so even at work I only work 8h and it's not too bad but now that I'm making plenty of money, I'm not sure if I want to spend time and effort on trying to build random things.\n\nDo you guys think it's worth it? On one hand, there's still a chance it can end up succeeding and I also continue to learn more things but on the other hand, should I continue to spend my time and effort on these side projects rather than pour it all into my job?\n\nAdvice is appreciated!",

Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. \n\nNot saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.\n\nFrom my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. \n\nOn the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more \"pass/fail\" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. \n\nI think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.\n\nBasically two styles: \"textbooker\"  who want puzzle masters, vs. \"collaborative\" who prioritize discussion and personality.\n\nAnd don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others. \n\nAnyone else notice this trend? How do you handle it?",

Nobody really cares whether you are working from the office or from home.\n\nBecause I felt I had started a little late, I set clear goals for myself and committed to following them with full focus. The company provides resources for learning, so I used every single one of them. On top of that I bought my own courses, set up AWS accounts, and practiced daily. I even had an old server lying around at home. I spun it up with Ubuntu and started building a homelab on weekends.\n\nExcited about my progress, I shared everything with my boss, hoping for feedback and guidance. Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as “too ambitious” and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.\n\nAt first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.\n\nMy plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.\n\nWhat I have realized is that ambition makes some people uncomfortable, but it also attracts the right kind of people who genuinely want to see you succeed. I am grateful that I found one of those people here.",

I had been letting other engineers on my team know where I'm getting stuck, they would give me recommendations that I tried implementing, then I try using those and they don't work.

I could probably push through the day but my biggest concern is getting someone whose immunocomprised or an elderly family member of a coworker seriously ill. These are my thoughts please let me know if this is an acceptable course of action, I'm honestly panicking hard I put so much effort in for this opportunity and I don't want to immediately shoot myself in the foot: \n\n- Send email now with test photo, explain that I feel well enough to come in masked but I am afraid of spreading if there is anyone immunocomprised and I'm unsure of company policy regarding this. Offer to work from home. \n- Wake up early and call ASAP saying the same thing. Try and make it to a clinic for meds to shorten duration and for additional proof of illness. \n\nUpdate: They are sending me back home and letting me on-board remotely, then likely sending me back out in a couple weeks. They were really chill about it and thanked me for letting them know and not coming in sick. ",

Current valuation is 60M after series A with 5M ARR and less than 20 employees. The downsides obviously include instability and the risk the equity is worth toilet paper. Unique to this role includes high amounts of travel. It's also riding the AI bubble so if that pops it would impact this company's perceived value and ability to get customers.\n\nI might work like hell, get laid off in 6 months, have a resume that looks like shit?

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nSome background: my mom has been dealing with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my mom’s cancer spread again last month. I’ve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.\n\nI’m a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. It’s not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but I’ve been there over a year and it’s remote so I can visit my mom and qualify for FMLA.\n\nA few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. It’s also remote, and I wouldn’t get FMLA if I needed it. \n\nI am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.\n\nI had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. \n\nI’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t now.\n\nI don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I don’t even want to try to take the assessment because I’m so overwhelmed, I’m behind at my current job and don’t have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least I’m comfortable though.\n\nI guess I’m just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter. How can I withdrawal in a way that could potentially leave the door open for future opportunities?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?\n\nFrustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.\n\nQA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.\n\nPlanning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.\n\nArchitecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.\n\nFor example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.\n\nI’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. I’ll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of “no it’s not” or “prove it”… so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told “stop being too technical”. Basically they don’t trust me when I tell them something is problematic, and then still don’t understand when I show the code causing the issue. It’s a no-win situation.\n\n\n1:1 with the tech lead who said basically “we don’t need to worry about good principles because we can rewrite the whole app in a month if we really had to, just chill out and stop worrying, the company isn’t really affected.” I disagree wholeheartedly, I think our performance has the ability to kill the company by destroying our customer’s trust from the sheer amount of bugs and misrepresented data in the product.",

But now I am seeing more people applying for entry-level positions with a Master's. \n\nI believe we are reaching a point where having a Master's is the bare minimum for post-grad job hunting. What do you guys think? I haven't heard much back besides a couple of OAs since graduating with my Bachelors in CS earlier this year in May, and I think this silent shift might have to do something about it.

Outside of protocols, RTOS, on-chip debugging (test setup/in-vehicle debugging).\n\nI want to move to G/amzn/mfst type of companies as a generalist or even specialized team but main point being I’d be an embedded engineer coming into more of a generalist C++/Java/Python team.\n\nI am worried I will be interviewed accordingly as well, meaning, not only will they hit me with leetcodes but they might bring in a couple of their resident embedded experts into one of the rounds or something just to grill me.\n\nI think the driving reason for this concern is the fact that I haven’t been apart of ground zero board bring up and then application development, I mostly dabble around the app layer and sometimes have to go deeper into the things I mention above (hence the previous distinction between experience and exposure).\n\nAlthough I am able to navigate the codebase and solve problems, I don’t TRULY know what’s going on from the ground up all the way to the application layer.\n\nIf someone asked me how a CAN transceiver works I couldn’t answer, “uhhh high low, take the delta??

But definitely don't want to be stuck making this for the rest of my career, and also not a big fan of this part of the country. \n\nThis leads me to my issue though -- should I apply to senior positions or normal SWE positions? Also, should I lie on my resumé to downplay the application I lead? It looks unbelievable that I list a $XY Billion application on my resumé as only 2 years post-grad. \n\nI am just not really sure how to proceed with applications, so looking to get any and all advice.

        "content": "Lots of little details here so bear with me. \n\n\nTech lead, 13 YOE, F500, WFH 95% of the time. Only need to go into the office for select VIP meetings. \n\n\nI am 9 weeks into \"maternity leave\" (aka 6 weeks to heal from major abdominal surgery plus 6 weeks unpaid leave) and I am getting anxiety about the end of it looming - mostly about dropping off my baby into daycare. First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.\n\n\nThis part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).\n\n\nI have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.\n\n\nAn additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a \"solution architect\" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal. \n\n\nSo I guess my questions are... Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? Am I crazy for contemplating how I can make it work? Any suggestions or advice in general? ",

        "content": "I’ve been working at an agency that supports a big telecom company for about 4 years. I started as a junior SWE building automation scripts and batch jobs for customer provisioning and order management flows. I liked the WLB since I worked from home most days and the hours were manageable.\n\nLast year the project I was working on ended, and I was moved into an incident manager role in the IT department of a smaller subsidiary of the company. It’s been rough and honestly taking a toll on my mental health. Most days are just nonstop incident calls with no coding to brush up on my skills. The environment is toxic and draining with constant cost cutting, shifting expectations, and heavy micromanagement from leadership. I have terrible hours and I’m expected to be on-call on weekends. Since I joined, two people were let go and now there are only three of us handling even more responsibilities. On top of that, I didn’t get a raise this year because I switched teams. My salary was above average for my area and experience, but not getting a raise really discouraged me. It's obvious they're taking advantage of the tough job market.\n\nI’ve been in my current role almost a year now and I’m ready to jump ship. I’ve been applying to jobs on and off (nearly 200) but only got one interview from a random recruiter on LinkedIn. It’s frustrating since I have 3 YoE as a dev and thought that would at least give me an edge. My old manager said transferring to another role internally would be tricky without my current team’s support.\n\nI know I got lucky during the 2021 hiring craze but I’m wondering if I’m cooked now. I would consider myself an average programmer with knowledge of basic fundamentals, I do leetcode occasionally but I don’t really have passion projects outside of work. Should I focus on side projects, certifications, start working on building my network, or maybe pivot into something like cybersecurity or data engineering? I’ve considered pursuing a master’s in AI/ML. I’d love some advice on what the smartest next steps might be.",

        "content": "I'm posting for a friend since they don't have enough karma to post here:\n\nI graduated in recent years and secured a software engineer job a couple months after graduation doing standard dev work in the traditional way (no AI). Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.\n\nI've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.\n\nI’m concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.\n\nIn the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, I’m concerned that my skills will not have grown here. I’ve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.\n\nStill being very early in my career, I’m wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.\n\nI personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone who’s inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.\n\nSo regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.\n\nAre there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?\n\n**\\*UPDATE/EDIT\\***\n\nPerhaps \"AI Vibe Coding\" was the wrong term, even though my job title is still Software Engineer, my role is more like \"Prompt Engineer\".\n\nI don't want to give too much details, but my team is currently coming up with and providing prompts for other teams to use in certain AI tools to expedite their workflows. We have also been training them on communication with the AI tools being used, basically \"AI Evangelists/Crusaders\" at this point.\n\nI haven't had the chance to write any code, and future projects are to create more prompts to feed these AI agents so they can automate more workflows. This process doesn't involve me ever having to delve deep into a codebase or understand an actual product. I'm basically working on just prompts.",

I then sought out legal representation, which was actually quite easy to find for my case\n\nI was at this job for 10 months. I was doing fairly well, hitting goals and everything. I even won the hackathon that happened this year. This thing that happened was totally out of my control. I tried to use standard legal channels that most companies would support, but the company didn't have HR, so that proved to be quite difficult\n\nSo now I'm looking for new jobs, and the question obviously comes up why I left this job so early. I'm never entirely sure what to say in this case. I don't want to be negative and put them down because that only reflects poorly on me. I'm a bit afraid to say anything underlying the legal case until it's resolved entirely\n\nWhat should I do?",

For now it feels like a dream of course, but maybe in 10 years I'll be there, and it would be awesome. The thing is that I'm fascinated by AI and truly believe that this is the future. Probably it's a controversial topic, but I really believe that AIs will change the world as the Internet did 35~ years ago, and I'd like to be one of those who'll build this world one way or another.\n\nAnyway, the question is, what skills should I develop now to start my career in AI/ML? I have a quite decent (at least in my country it's considered decent, but not some really high level) IT background with several years of system administration and a software engineer college degree (technically I can code, but my job has never required something more serious than Python/Bash QoL scripts, so my coding skills are probably somewhere around junior), but for some reason I feel like except the general basics it does not apply to LLMs/AI. I mean... theoretically I could get a job where I'd have to develop a mobile/desktop app that is built around AI or something like that, but it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something that is directly related to AIs, even if it's just a prompt engineering role. ",

        "author": "Mislavoo7",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**TL;DR:** I’ve worked \\~9 years in the same IT company (mostly backend, some frontend + DevOps). My salary is low (\\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \\~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.\n\nThe challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so it’s hard to compare my experience with \"standard\" projects. That’s why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.\n\n# What I built\n\nI made two projects:\n\n* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.\n* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.\n\n# The idea\n\nUsers can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.\n\nI intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a \"real\" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.\n\n# What I worked with\n\n**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.\n\n* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).\n* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).\n* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.\n* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).\n\n**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**\n\nUsers can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.\n\n* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).\n* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (€/$), theme (light/dark).\n* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.\n\n**DevOps**\n\nI Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.\n\n**Content**\n\nI wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.\n\n# Code & live apps\n\nGitHub repo for Rails app: [Sparenzi Web](https://sparenzi.eu/) and [Repo](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenziweb/tree/master)\n\n(There are few commits because I developed in a private GitLab repo and only published the final version here)\n\nGitHub repo for React Native app: [Sparenzi](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenzi)\n\n# What I'd love to know\n\n* How would you rate my project execution? (both technically and as a portfolio piece)\n* What should I improve before showing this to recruiters / potential employers?\n* Based on what I’ve shown here, should I present myself as junior, mid, or senior developer?\n* I’m considering taking on freelance jobs in the \\~$20/h range (about 20h/week alongside my current job). Is this realistic, or should I ask for more/less per hour and more/less hours per week?\n\nAny honest feedback is super welcome — I’m trying to figure out my real position on the market so I can plan my next steps.\n\nThanks!",

I enjoy both areas (software, hardware, and everything in between), so the only question is which one offers better work prospects? Also, if you did any of these what college did you go to (I'm still looking for colleges so I'd like to know some ppl's experiences). Thanks!",

I programming, and troubleshooting PLC, SCADA, ROBOTOTICS. \n\nDuring my studies, i took courses of programming,  OOP, Algorithms, and Data structures. I really enjoyed those courses . I was very good at C++, Python, Java script basically over all logic building. \n\nI want to switch to a computer science job now. What field would you suggest that will be good for me to get into at this point.  I am a fast learner. Alot of my past class fellows have already switched to a CS based careers because of poor Electrical job market in my country. They are working in app development, web development amd cybersecurity. \n\nSo what CS based career do you think i should go into. \n\nYour opinion will help me alot in my decision.  Thank you very much. ",

        "content": "Context:\n\nI'm a Junior software engineer with about 2 years of experience and with no ops experience in my current position (mostly just React and Spring Boot developer work). I have started to dislike development work and wanted to pivot away from it. I'm not really sure at the moment what I want to do, but had an interest in trying for an infra / ops role.\n\nI somehow managed to stumble upon and receive an offer for a \"Cloud Engineer\" position. Upon learning more about the position the role and research, the role seems to be like a Platform Engineer. Essentially I would be working on the company's Internal Developer Portal (IDP) powered by Backstage helping to research new developer tooling, supporting new pipelines, and helping to modernize and onboard applications teams to the platform. I believe another term for this would be building out a \"low code\" internal cloud platform\n\nI have no connections that have experience working with IDPs so wanted to take a shot in the dark and seek out any engineers in this area of work or have worked adjacently with it and ask the following questions:\n\n1. Am I pigeonholing myself to a certain niche in this kind of role? How applicable does work in this kind of position apply to other DevOps roles?\n2. In your experience how difficult has it been getting application teams to transition to this kind of platform?\n3. Is this an upcoming way of approaching and accelerating enterprise app deployment or has this been a relatively niche approach to maintaining infrastructure and operations that only certain companies pilot?\n\nAny help on this would be appreciated as I have literally never seen this sort of position even within my current company.",

This class does all the work (updates tables, generates the PDF, calls the web API, etc), all I really do is feed it the string for the body of the email.   \n\nEven when I am creating new processes, it is mostly just sticking together these already existing classes. It would be inefficient and increase risks of introducing bugs to the codebase if I tried to create a different Send Email class for my process.   \n\nIt kind of makes me feel like less of a software engineer and more like I am just writing glue to fit these already existing puzzle pieces together.",

On our team, we’ve got two other juniors (1 yr each), and two seniors (7 yrs+) but with little social skills and communication issues. Three months ago, we hired a team lead, but the MVP still isn’t delivered because of poor planning, prioritization, and follow-up. I flagged this to the team lead to no avail, then talked to the CeO directly, he gave him another chance, but nothing changed. Now the CEO wants to replace him.\n\nHere’s my thought:\nWe don’t actually need another “team lead.” We already handle PRs and code reviews internally. What we really need is proper planning, prioritization, and alignment, in other words, a technical project manager. I’ve already been doing parts of this informally, and I want to propose stepping into that role officially. It’d be a chance for me to grow, get promoted, and make sure the project actually delivers.\n\nQuestion is , with only 2 years’ experience, do you think it’s too soon to pitch myself for this? Or is this exactly the kind of move that accelerates a career?",
