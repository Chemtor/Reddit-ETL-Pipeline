After 7 years in this area (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nWhy are companies acting like jerks?\n\nLast week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”\n\nSeriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?\n\nHere’s what I’ve noticed:\n\n* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.\n* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.\n* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.\n* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.\n\nDo you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?\n\nI’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\n\n\\-----\n\n\\[EDIT\\]\n\nI'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",

Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?\n\nMaybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as \"table stakes\" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was \"Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that.\" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?\n\nI think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:\n\n* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.\n* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.\n* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \\`join\\` logic from being repeated in multiple places.\n   * Not to mention general \\`join\\` efficiency\n* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \\`join\\`s should work.\n\nI'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.\n\nFull disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all. But I'll certainly give credit to all you r/dataengineers.",

I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came. That’s part of why I’m leaving: the pressure has become too much.\n\nHere’s the complication:\n\nI made the decision to accept a new job the day before I left for a long-planned vacation.\n\nMy new role starts right after my trip, so I’ll be giving my notice during my vacation, meaning 1/4th of my two weeks will be PTO.\n\nI didn’t plan it like this. It’s just unfortunate timing.\n\n\nI genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.\n\nHas anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?\n\nHow did you propose it?\n\nDid you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?\n\nDo you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?\n\nIs this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?\n\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.\n\n\n",

I thought it was a great way to get off the dev treadmill and write mostly SQL day to day and it turned out I was really good at it, becoming a tech lead over the next 18 months. \n\nI'm trying to go back to dev now. So much stuff as a data engineer is completely out of your control but you're expected to just fix it. People constantly question numbers if it doesn't match their vibes. Nobody understands the complexities. It's also so, so hard to test in the same concrete way as regular services and applications.\n\nData teams are also largely full of non-technical people. I regularly have to argue with/convince people that basic things like source control are necessary. Even my fellow engineers won't take five minutes to read how things like Docker or CI/CD workflows function.\n\n\nI'm looking at a large pay cut going back to being a dev but it's worth my sanity.

Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.\n\nFor example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.\n\nThey would create \n\n* the User entity\n* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)\n* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the two\n\nAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.\n\nDo you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.\n\nI understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.\n\nTheir progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nI need some honest guidance from the community.\n\nI was previously working at a service-based MNC and had been trying hard to switch into a more data-focused role. After a lot of effort, I got an offer from a known consulting company. The role was labeled as Data Engineer, and it sounded like the kind of step up I had been looking for — better tools, better projects, and a brand name that looked solid on paper.\n\nFast forward ~9 months, and honestly, I regret the move almost every single day.\nThere’s barely any actual engineering work. The focus is all on meeting strict client deadlines (which company usually promise to clients), crafting stories, and building slide decks. All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. \nThere’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.\n\nTo make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.\n\n\nFor context, my background is:\n\n•\t~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)\n\n•\t~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks\n\n•\tComfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)\n\nI joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here. I feel more like a delivery robot than an engineer.\n\nWould love some advice:\n\n•\tAre there companies that actually value hands-on data engineering and learning?\n\n•\tHas anyone else experienced this after moving into consulting?\n\nAppreciate any tips, advices, or even relatable experiences.",

In there, we have resources that are spin up by business analysts, data analysts and project managers. There is no clear traceability for the resources as they weren’t deployed using iaac and instead directly on aws console, just imagine a crazy amount of resources like S3, EC2, Lambdas all deployed in silos with no code base to trace them to projects. The only traceable ones are those that are deployed by the data engineering team. \n\nMy question is, how should we be dealing with the clean up for this environment before we commence with the set up of data warehouse? Do we still give access to the different parties or we should revoke their access to govern and control our warehouse?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm currently working with a medallion architecture inside Fabric and would love to hear how others handle the **raw → bronze** process, especially when mixing **incremental and full loads**.\n\nHere’s a short overview of our layers:\n\n* **Raw**: Raw data from different source systems\n* **Bronze (technical layer)**: Raw data enriched with technical fields like `business_ts`, `primary_hash`, `payload_hash`, etc.\n* **Silver**: Structured and modeled data, aggregated based on our business model\n* **Gold**: Smaller, consumer-oriented aggregates for dashboards, specific departments, etc.\n\nIn the **raw → bronze** step, a colleague taught me to create two hashes:\n\n* `primary_hash`: to uniquely identify a record (based on business keys)\n* `payload_hash`: to detect if a record has changed\n\nWe’re using Delta Tables in the bronze layer and the logic is:\n\n* **Insert** if the `primary_hash` does not exist\n* **Update** if the `primary_hash` exists but the `payload_hash` has changed\n* **Delete** if a `primary_hash` from a previous load is missing in the current extraction\n\nThis logic works well *if* we always had a full load.\n\nBut here's the issue: our source systems deliver **a mix of full and incremental loads**, and in incremental mode, we might only get a tiny fraction of all records. With the current implementation, that results in **95% of the data being deleted**, even though it's still valid – it just wasn't part of the incremental pull.\n\nNow I'm wondering:  \nOne idea I had was to **add a boolean flag** (e.g. `is_current`) to mark if the record was seen in the latest load, along with a `last_loaded_ts` field. But then the question becomes:  \n**How can I determine if a record is still “active” when I only get partial (incremental) data and no full snapshot to compare against?**\n\nAnother aspect I’m unsure about is **data retention and storage costs**.  \nThe idea was to **keep the full history of records** permanently, so we could go back and see what the data looked like at a certain point in time (e.g., *\"What was the state on 2025-01-01?\"*). But I’m concerned this could lead to **massive storage costs over time**, especially with large datasets.\n\nHow do you handle this in practice?\n\n* Do you keep historical records in Bronze or move history handling to Silver/Gold?\n* Do you archive older data somewhere else?\n* How do you balance auditability and cost?\n\nThanks in advance for any input! I'd really appreciate hearing how others are approaching this kind of problem or i'm the only Person.\n\nThanks a lot!",

        "content": "I come from a self taught background, and have been in my F200 “Data engineer” role for about a year. I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.\n\nThen through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.\n\nFast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:\n\n- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team\n- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design\n- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud\n    - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos\n- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting\n- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasks\n\nNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.\n\nI guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated. I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who has felt out of their depth in early-ish career.",

What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.\n\nWhere I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.\n\nHowever, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view. Today, counting a year and a half of internship, I'm going on three and a half years in data engineering.\n\nAnyway, what do you think?",

I want to ask how should I design the architecture?\n2. What tools do I use for data warehouse. \n3. What tools do I use for visualization\n4. What tool do I use for orchestration\n5. How do I talk to data using natural language and what tool do I use for that \n\nIs there a guide I can follow.

I know DE concepts. I want to make a medallion architecture. I am well versed with DE practices and standards, I just don't want to implement something that is costly and not beneficial for the company. \n\nI think what I was looking for is how to weigh my options between different tools.

        "content": "TL;DR  \nWe’re in the parking industry, running Talend Open Studio + PostgreSQL + shell scripts (all self-hosted). It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.\n\nFiguring out:\n\n* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation\n* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant\n* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\n\n\\---\n\nHey all!\n\nWe’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.\n\n# Current setup:\n\n* PostgreSQL (\\~80–100GB per customer, growing \\~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area\n* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)\n* Shell scripts for orchestration\n* Tableau Server\n* ETL approach\n* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat files\n\nWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.\n\n# Why we’re moving on:\n\nTalend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.\n\nAdditionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.\n\nWe have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.\n\nWe’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words \"modern this, cloud that\", etc...  \nBut we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.\n\nWe’re trying to build something that:\n\n* Actually works for our use case\n* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible\n* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant\n* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire\n\n# Our modernization idea:\n\n* Python + PySpark for pipelines\n* ELT instead of ETL\n* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one\n* Airflow for orchestration\n* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical\n* Great Expectations for data validation\n* Vault for secrets\n* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment\n* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging\n* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.\n\nAll self-hosted and open-source (for now).\n\n# The big question: architecture\n\nStill not sure whether to go:\n\n* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)\n* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)\n\nOur sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.\n\nI believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a \"product\" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.\n\n# Questions for the community:\n\n* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?\n* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?\n* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?\n* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?\n* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?\n* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?\n\nWe’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.\n\nAppreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights. \n\nCheers!",

I decided to roll my own instead of using an existing one like Pandera / dataframely because I found that all the features I needed were scattered across several different existing validation libraries. At minimum, I wanted something lightweight (no Pydantic / minimal dependencies), DataFrame-agnostic, and that has a very flexible API for custom checks. I think I've achieved that, with a couple of other nice features on top (like generating a schema from existing data, filtering out failed rows, etc.), so I wanted to both share and get feedback on it!

We ingest data into the bronze layer from a wide variety of sources: APIs, Excel files, third-party applications, etc. Because of this diversity, we struggle with establishing consistent naming conventions.\n\nFor example, many datasets don’t have a straightforward business concept like `CustomerSales` or `OrderDetails`. Some are operational logs, others are reference datasets or ad hoc data pulls. This makes it hard to define a universal naming strategy.\n\nIn the gold layer, we use standard prefixes like `dim_` and `fact_` where applicable, but we often have tables that don’t neatly fall into dimension or fact categories. These are still critical to downstream consumption but are harder to categorize and name.\n\nI'm looking for:\n\n* Examples of naming conventions you’ve successfully applied in medallion architectures.\n* Resources or documentation that helped your organization design naming standards.\n* Tips for balancing flexibility and consistency when working with heterogeneous data sources.\n\nAny advice or pointers would be appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "content": "**TLDR:**\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).\n\nRegarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:\n\n* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.\n* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.\n* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.\n\nHugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).\n\nThis is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nBit of a newbie question for all you veterans.\n\nWe're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.\n\nSo far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.\n\nThat said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?\n\nCurious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",

Also, transferring ownership of Snowflake objects to many new roles is complicated and can effectively  break views for end users and change our \"future\" role assignments.

Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).\nData in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. \n\nPrimarily, the changes that we want to track are: \n1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time 🥲)\n2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)\n3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)\n4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. \n\nTo do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. \n\nThis what I tried so far:\n1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/\"expectations\";\n2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). \n3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. \n\nAm I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described? Or is the market really overloaded with stuff that says that it does everything, while in fact does do squat?",

        "content": "I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.\n\n1. \n\n>Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change \"atomic\" within a single transaction.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as \"RUN\", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.\n\nWhat is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations?  \nI do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK.   \nLogically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?\n\n2. \n\nI am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers.  \nThat is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct?\n\n    databaseChangeLog:\n      - changeSet:\n          id: periods-log-trigger\n          author: XYZ\n          runOnChange: true\n          changes:\n            - sqlFile:\n                path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql\n            - sqlFile:\n                path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql\n          rollback:\n            - sql:\n                sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()\n\n\n\n3. \n\nBack to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.\n\nBecause createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is  dropped?\n\nThanks everyone!",

Its running basic filters over 1B rows in 50ms (single node, no indexing), it’s currently outperforming ClickHouse by 10x on the same machine. \n\nI’m curious if this is interesting to people? I’m thinking this may be useful for:\n\n* real-time dashboards\n* lookups on pre-processed datasets\n* quick queries for larger model training\n* potentially even just general analytics queries for small/mid sized companies\n\nThere's a (very minimal) MVP up at [www.warpdb.io](http://www.warpdb.io) with playground if people want to fiddle. Not exactly sure where to take it from here, I mostly wanted to prove it's possible, and well, it is! :D\n\nVery open to any thoughts / feedback / discussions, would love to hear what the community thinks!\n\nCheers,  \nPhil",

I want to have sql query code review and strict policies on how to design reports. Code review being one of them.

For example, table A’s X field is just looking up the X field on table B. When we update X field on table B, table B will get a new SystemModStamp but table A won’t. So when we sync the data, table B will have correct data on Snowflake but table A won’t. \n\nI have identified 2 potential solutions \n1. Full table replication: will have correct data but costly \n2. Rebuild Salesforce logic: can use dbt to rebuild the logic but will take too much time \n\nHas anyone faced similar issues?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve \"weekly\" or \"monthly\" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it? Either way can someone give me some educational texts to support your opinions for this scenario?",

I’ve always had an interest in:\n\t•\tCoding\n\t•\tData\n\t•\tTrends and analysis\n\t•\tLogical thinking\n\nAt the same time, I’ve always had a creative eye. I care a lot about user experience — not just in buildings or cities, but in how people interact with things in general. That’s what drew me to look into Product Design and Data Analytics as possible career paths.\n\nThe thing is, job listings for data analytics seem higher in Germany. Product design roles are fewer, which makes me nervous. But I’m worried:\n\t•\tWill product design be just another draining, underpaid creative field like architecture?\n\t•\tWill data analytics be too dry or rigid long term?\n\t•\tAnd realistically, which path is better for career growth and salary in the long run?\n\nI’m not expecting overnight success, but I also don’t want to be stuck at a junior/mid salary range forever. I’m trying to find something where I can grow steadily, have a healthier work-life balance, and still enjoy what I do.\n\nIf anyone here has made the leap from architecture to either field (or knows someone who did), I’d love to hear what made the difference for you, and what you’d recommend.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏🏼 ",

I’m really passionate about development and worried that continuing in Big Data might limit my growth and motivation.\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\t1.\tIf I stick with the Big Data stream for now, is it possible to switch to a full SDE role (either within Infosys or in another company) after 1-3 years?\n\t2.\tHas anyone here made a similar switch from Big Data/Analytics to Development? How difficult was it?\n\t3.\tWhat skills should I keep brushing up on while working in Big Data to stay prepared for a development role?",

The configuration will define the table structure and the merge keys for upserts.\n\nThe general flow looks like this:\n\n1. Use Airflow’s data_interval_start macro to identify and read all S3 files for the relevant partition and generate a manifest file.\n\n\n2. Use the manifest to load data into a Redshift staging table via the COPY command.\n\n\n3. Perform an upsert from the staging table into the target table.\n\n\n\nI plan to run the data load on ECS, with Airflow triggering the ECS task on schedule.\n\nMy main question: I want to decouple config changes (YAML updates) from changes in the EL pipeline code.\nWould it make sense to store the YAML configs in S3 and pass a reference (like the S3 path or config name) to the ECS task via environment variables or task parameters?\nAlso I want to create a separate ECS task for each table, is dynamic task mapping the best way to do this? Is there a way i get the number of tables from the config file and then pass it as a parameter to dynamic task mapping? \n\nIs this a viable and scalable approach?

A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. \n\nOur app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.\n\nWe'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.\n\nWe've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).\n\nBefore we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.\n\nFor more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.\n\nI'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.\n\nTo give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.\n\nNow, about the two offers:\n\nOn one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.\n\nHowever, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.\n\nThe second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of \"Data Scientist Analyst\", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.\n\nThe positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.\n\nThat’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.\n\nSo I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.\n\nAgain, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",

The data I'm looking for is hotel price and availability. In the past, when building pipelines that fetch data from APIs, I've always done something along the lines of:\n\n1. Fetch data, store as raw json in some kind of identifiable way, eg. Hive partitioned folders or filenames comprised of dimensions.\n2. Do some transformation/aggregation, store in partitioned parquet files.\n3. Push to more available database for API to query.\n\nI'm finding it tricky with this kind of data though, as I can't really partition or store the json in an identifiable way given the number of dimensions, without making a lot of partitions. Even if I could, I'd also be making a parquet file per request, which would also add up quickly and slow things down. I could just put this data directly into an sql database and not backup the json, but I'd like to keep everything if possible.\n\nI want the app to function well, but I also want to teach myself best practices when working with this kind of data.\n\nAm I going about this all wrong? I'm more of a full stack dev than a data engineer, so I'm probably missing something fundamental. I've explored delta tables, but that still leaves me with a lot of small .parquet files and the delta table would effectively be the raw json anyway at that point. Any help of advice would be greatly appreciated.",

My role sits between **data engineering** (pipelines, lakehouse patterns) and **data management/governance** (models, access, quality, compliance).\n\nI’m debating whether to invest the time to earn **Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect Expert** (AZ-305 + AZ-104). I care about *some* of the skills covered — identity, security boundaries, storage strategy, DR — because they affect how I design governed data platforms. But the cert path also includes a lot of infra/app content I rarely touch deeply.\n\n**So I’m trying to decide:**  \nIs the Architect Expert cert actually worth it for someone who is *primarily* a data / analytics / platform architect, not an infra generalist?\n\n---\n\n### What I’m weighing\n- **Relevance:** How much of the Architect content do you actually use in data platform work (Fabric, Databricks, Synapse heritage, governed data lakes)?\n- **Market signal:** Do hiring managers / clients care that a data architect also holds the Azure Architect Expert badge? Does it open doors (RFP filters, security reviews, higher rates)?\n- **Alt investments:** Would my time be better spent on **Microsoft Fabric (DP-700)**, **FinOps Practitioner**, **TOGAF Foundation**, or **Azure AI Engineer (AI-102)** if I want to grow toward Data+AI platform design?\n- **Timing:** Sensible to learn the *topics* (identity, Private Link, continuity) but delay the actual cert until a project or client demands it?\n\n",

        "content": "So I'm a relatively new teacher at a high school (15-17 y/o's), and I teach programming. The subject only has one 40-minute class a week per group, **with no option for giving them homework or anything outside of class hours**.\n\nI first learned programming with Unity and C#, and that's what I want to try with them. I think static typing and having an interface is a good way to teach programming, and game dev simply sounds more fun. I tried it already for a few months last year, it didn't really work out, it was too confusing for them. But I still want to give it a shot. (Especially now that I'm actually going to have a fucking projector so they can see my screen). (Hopefully). (Yes this is not a very high-budget school).\n\nThe idea is to teach them the very basics C# (variables, conditionals, functions, maybe arrays and loops), and have them play with the basic Unity components (sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, and basic GUI). No OOP (except to interact with components). No 3D. No fuss. But even that sounds like too much for our restrictions, with my limited experience.\n\nSo, how would you approach giving a class like that? I don't know if this is the right place, but I really don't know where else to post this.\n\nI'm not married to the idea of Unity or gamedev though, I'm open to suggestions. But it has to be something interactive and graphical so they're interested. Bear in mind these are high-schoolers, most of them aren't interested in programming, and the class is only there to kind of teach them how computers work and how to think systematically.\n\nSome other things I've thought of:\n\n* Tkinter: don't love the idea of dynamically-typed Python, and not that engaging\n* Godot: interface more confusing than Unity's imo\n* Pygame: even if it's simpler, no GUI at all is arguably way harder\n* Arduino: really cool idea and easier programming, but obviously we'd need Arduinos, which we don't have, and emulators like TinkerCAD just aren't the same\n* Java forms on NetBeans: not that engaging\n\nI'd love to hear any insight or suggestions whatsoever, especially if any of you have been teachers.",

I have NO IDEA how those \"no-code\" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.\n\nSo, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. \"Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each <li> element in it's own little border side-by side\". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each <li> element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. \"They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code\". I paste the supposedly \"corrected code\" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, \"Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version\", and it's not the correct version.\n\nAnother example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of \"seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?\" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating. How does someone who knows NOTHING do this and not go crazy?",

        "content": "I have been using Codefinity for a few weeks and wanted to share my honest review. Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.\n\n\n\nThat said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.\n\n\n\nJust to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.\n\n\n\nI’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time. Did you find that the content goes beyond beginner level and really builds useful skills? Do you think it’s worth continuing with, or are there better platforms out there for someone looking to grow step by step? I would appreciate hearing your experiences. Thanks!",

How can people argue like this when there are literally thousands of conflicting opinions online about what should be **basic** OOP stuff?\n\nIn math, you have a **clear** definition. In geometry, you have **clear** definitions of theorems, axioms, and so on. But in programming? Everything feels so vague, like I’m in a philosophy or theology lecture, not studying a field where precision should be the highest priority.\n\nSeriously — **where’s the original source of truth** for this?

I recently dropped my major to a minor despite having only 2 classes left due to the sheer amount of stress it put on me and also not fitting in the box that the department wants me to fit in. At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies. For the record, I am self-taught, and of course there are gaps in my knowledge, but should anyone really care what tools I use or what I do and don't know so long as my own goals are reached? I'm more than willing to learn specific langs, frameworks, or concepts if it means I understand how to tackle a problem better, even if not in a lecture hall trying not to gouge my eyes out from sheer boredom. To be fair, I also freelance, but even still, I absolutely despite making things for the primary purpose of making a profit. Am I rambling or writing a word salad? Probably, I'm a little sleepy right now.\n\nTL;DR I like to play with my toys in my sandbox after building them, and I will never understand the culture that if you're wanting to do CS, you better want a job, because apparently people who just do it as a passion or hobby are seen as less valuable or don't have a place in the field (at least that's how I perceive it).

I really want to help my family out as soon as I can.\n\nBut yeah, I just don’t know what I should be doing right now to actually get closer to that.

I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years.  \nI love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education.  \nHowever, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities.  \nThe reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.\n\nSo I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.\n\nTL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

I'm emotionally stressed and helpless. My parents are nice people but I don't want to disappoint them. Since I'm the eldest child, I have a lot of responsibilities. I'm a procrastinator but I try so hard to improve myself and still get misunderstood a lot by my parents. I want to show them I'm not 'worthless' and 'dumb'. I've only learnt C language at high school. I want to do something in these spare months that I got. I love gaming but I've never code before, I don't know where shall I start. Python? I have no idea, I'm just a newbie. I'm a digital artist and can actually draw pretty well, this was one of the major reasons I thought of becoming a game developer because I love story telling games. I just needed a small advice if anyone can guide me what should I start with. I'd be very grateful for your advice.",

        "author": "mosahel",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello,\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, I started with programming and all this tech stuff at the very beginning of 2024. I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.\n\n\n\nThen I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.\n\n\n\nI’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.\n\n\n\nSo now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.\n\n\n\nRight now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects? I really want to make the most of this last year so I don’t end up with no job at the end, but I could use some advice—even just on what to learn, what order to tackle things, or how to structure my study time.\n\n\n\nIf anyone’s been in a similar situation, or has tips for making the most of this final stretch—whether it’s about Java, backend projects, passing those backlogs, or handling the stress of not knowing what’s next—I’d really appreciate any guidance.\n\n\n\nThank you!",

Some specific algorithms I don't recall learning but everything there I have some exposure to.  But probably 70 to 80% of it I could not tell you about it.  Yet the person who created it is, I would imagine?, suggesting you should know \\*all\\* of these things as a developer.  I've proven (to myself) that I can know all of these things for a short period of time, my degree and other things shows this to be true.  But I don't have the skills to actually utilize them outside of the brief period of time where I knew them.\n\nDo I just have not have the brain for this stuff?  Or are people out there studying 24/7 topics they never use to stay fresh?  I can barely stand to study for an hour a day and even then I hardly retain anything.",

Sure, I could just not use AI, but who is really going to choose to be less productive, especially at work where everyone else is using it?\n\nIt doesn’t feel the same anymore. The craftsmanship of coding feels like it is dying. I used to spend hours reading documentation, slowly building something through rigorous testing and tweaking, enjoying every part of the process. Now I just prompt and paste. There is zero fulfillment. When people talk about AI replacing programmers, most worry about losing their jobs. That doesn’t worry me, because someone will still have to prompt and fix AI-generated code. For me it’s about losing the joy of building something yourself.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?

That being said, I did try my hardest, and it is my first project. Oversimplified, my System uses fire science equations, a grid representing terrain, and some custom graph traversal algorithms to predict how a fire spreads across different terrain under different conditions, allowing the user to select a starting position and fire-start position to start the simulation. I posted it on LinkedIn but like, nobody really cared enough to actually look at it and give me feedback lol.\n\nI'm hoping I'd find people here willing to critique it. I am not planning on building it out again, my next step is a multi-agent disaster response simulation, but I feel like any advice on how I could have made this project better would help me in the long run\n\nThank you!",

However, I am struggling to find roles that I feel I would be suited for. I know that what I like is more low-level stuff (specifically C++), and that I don't really have any interest in web development or working in the traditional \"big tech\" companies, which I feel like are the dominant hiring fields for new grads. I think embedded systems would be a good fit for me, or possibly programming for telecom (though maybe that's also just embedded systems?). I will have a few decently-sized resume projects under my belt by graduation, and one will hopefully be done by the end of the summer for earlier application deadlines. I'm also interested in AI, but more of the mathematical/backend stuff (i.e. being one of the people working on PyTorch itself or developing new models, not just using PyTorch to create a CNN or something).\n\nSo, my questions: What kind of things should I be looking for as I search for job postings online? When I'm looking for alumni from my school to connect with, what kind of roles should I be looking for them to have?

Just for the sake of learning tbh.  \nSince I'll (probably) stick with some personal CLI tools for automation and simple tasks I don't need languages with sophisticated GUI or ML support.  \nCode should be running with little to no effort on both, Windows and Linux (MacOS is nice to have, but not a must)\n\nMy first idea was to check out Go, since it's syntax and overall featureset seems appealing to me. Same goes for Rust although the borrow-checker is... \"something different\"\n\nQuestion now:  \nDo you have any input on why to go (or not go) whith the one or other language? Might something be more suited for my purposes? Any pros and cons that I might be missing?",

I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.\n\nMy 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:\n\nFirst, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.\n\nHow does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. \n\nFor those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS? I only know of my journey so I'm curious to hear about others.\n\nThanks",

I don’t know how to address/fix the problems in general and would like to know maybe if there are terms, topics, or other things I just don’t know are important but could be an 80/20 type thing for me. Things I can really practice or study that will have the most impact. I’m not sure what I’m expecting as answers.

(This didn’t come as a shock to my friends, family, or me.)\n\nSince then, I’ve been educating myself, completing _The Odin Project_ and working on several small personal projects. I enrolled in the Open University a while ago and am set to start a 2 year software development course in October.\n\nWhere I need your guidance is this: given the current state of education, I’m struggling to figure out whether university is really the best option. Frankly, I see a lot of UK university education as BS (subject dependent, of course). I saw this with joinery courses in my late teens, which led me to skip further education in that field and instead take a minimum wage job. I slowly but surely worked my way into full-time self-employment with decent pay. That turned out to be the right choice for me at the time.\n\nAnother caveat: While I’ll receive student finance for tuition, I’ll need to support myself alongside studying by working in hospitality most days and weekends. (The scope and grind of this doesn’t faze me as I know people who have done this before.)\n\nThere’s a part of me that thinks a better option might be to get a low-paid tech job (since it’s related) and continue educating myself over the next two years. The goal would be to build a strong portfolio and eventually transition into programming full time.\n\n**NOT programming is NOT an option.**\n\nSo I ask you all:\n\n- How feasible is my second option?\n    \n- Do you think the courses currently available are a waste of time and money?\n    \n- What would you do in the same situation?\n    \n\nKind regards,  \nSome lurker who has never posted to Reddit before",

As a result, the code turned out to be quite difficult to understand—not completely unreadable, but definitely complex.\n\nSo here's my question: do you refactor your code before delivering it to the client? And if you do, do you charge extra for it? How does this usually work in the industry?\n\nThank you.",

I'm looking to animate some text: specifically, I want to input a string, and I want a program that will output an animation (in whatever form, I don't really mind at this stage) that shows that text being drawn **as if it was being written by hand**. So, for example, if I input the letter \"b\", I want an output animation that shows the vertical line of the \"b\" being drawn from top to bottom, then the circle of the \"b\" being drawn clockwise. See, for example, the animation [here](https://www.kanshudo.com/blog/kanji-animations) for the kind of effect I want to achieve.\n\nI'm aware that this means I might have to specify how each glyph of a certain font should be animated individually and so on, but I'm still lost on how best to do it. Surely the creators of these kanji animations did it line-by-line rather than frame-by-frame. But, if I'm honest, I don't know the first thing about how TTFs work or how to output animation in any reasonable format. Can anyone advise? Any sensible language is fine. Thanks.",

I don’t have much technical knowledge yet, I’m still learning the basics of JavaScript and web development but I wanted to learn by building something real. So I came up with an idea called **SafeSign++**, which I’m trying to build as I learn. The idea is to make a browser extension that can help prevent online fraud like phishing, fake KYC forms, and credential theft by giving users real-time warnings when they’re doing risky things like entering passwords, uploading documents, or clicking suspicious links. I also want to create a simple backend that collects reports about scammy websites and gives each site a kind of “trust score” based on how many users flagged it. I’m honestly not sure how feasible or practical the idea is, or if I’m completely off track  so I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, or criticism from the community (or even roasts lol), especially around feasibility, gaps in the idea, or suggestions for what I should read, learn, or improve. This is my way of learning by doing, and I’d be grateful for any help.\n\nIf anyone has resources, beginner-friendly guides, or thoughts on how I could actually make the detection/warning parts work in a real browser extension, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**TL;DR**: I’m a beginner learning JavaScript & web dev, trying to build a browser extension (SafeSign++) to warn users in real-time about scams and phishing.

        "title": "Four steps to improving your learning from tutorials",
        "author": "Paxtian",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "There's a lot of talk about being stuck in Tutorial Hell, and I agree, it can definitely be a trap. However, you can get much more out of tutorials if you do more than just simply follow along and do what they tell you to do. Here are my recommended steps to improving what you take away from tutorials, regardless of what you may be trying to learn.\n\nFirst: Follow the tutorial, but stop regularly. After each new concept is introduced (that you're not yet familiar with), whether that's a function, API, keyword, whatever, as soon as the concept is introduced, jump to a Notes document (wherever you happen to take notes: Notepad, CherryTree, Word Doc, Google Doc, whatever it is), and write down the name of the thing.  Once the tutorial finishes with that concept, pause it. Go look up whatever it is in the relevant documentation. Read the documentation on that thing. In your notes, write down (in your own words) what you understand about that concept under it: how it's used, arguments, when you used it, what you understand the documentation to mean, etc. Continue in this way until you finish the tutorial. Reread all your notes once the tutorial is over.\n\nSecond: Do the tutorial again. But start completely fresh. This time, when you get to each new concept, pause the video and try to finish that section completely on your own. Refer to your notes as necessary. If you can't get it working, go back to the tutorial and watch it and do it the way it says. If you make a mistake, revise your notes so that they more clearly explain the concept. If you get it right, rewatch that section of the tutorial and see if your predicted way of getting it to work is the same, or if you did it in a slightly different way. If you did it differently but it still worked, make note of this as an alternative way that also worked. Once the tutorial is over, reread all your notes again.\n\nThird: Use each concept from the tutorial in a completely independent way. If you learned 30 concepts, make 30 micro projects focused on those concepts. Use them for something completely different. If two or more concepts depend on each other, combine them as needed. But review the docs and see if they can be used independently, or combined in different ways. \n\nFourth: Do a big, similar project completely on your own that uses the concepts you've learned but in a different way. Review your notes and the documentation as necessary. \n\nIf you do future tutorials, jump right to the second step: as you do them, rather than following along mindlessly, for each new concept, try to do it on your own. As a new concept starts to be introduced, pause it and try to think about how you'd do it. If you can't, review your notes and see if anything jumps out. If there's still nothing, treat it as going back to the First Step, and watch the tutorial and update your notes, review the documentation, etc. Otherwise, have two parallel projects going: the way this new tutorial does it, and the way you'd do it. For the \"your way\" version, keep it going with your way as long as you can, even if it diverges significantly from the \"tutorial way\" version. If at some point your version just won't work anymore, delete it, copy the tutorial version over, and make that one the new \"your version\" and proceed on with trying to do it your own way. And of course, keep updating your notes as you go, revising and updating and reviewing the documentation as needed. If an existing concept is added to, update it. If new concepts are introduced, add them. Once this new tutorial is done, repeat the third and fourth steps, but with the twist of trying to make a full project that combines both the stuff you learned from previous tutorial(s) and this new tutorial.",

        "content": "I'm a backend engineer at a (well funded) startup, helped out with the interview process recently. We wanted to fill these 3 roles: backend, devops, and data engineering. I was surprised at how quickly we were able to wrap it up.\n\nCouple of observations:\n\n__You're actually pretty cooked if you don't have networking skills.__\n\nWe received 500+ applications across all the 3 roles in just one week, which seemed crazy for a seed stage startup in a niche industry. Even after filtering them for (a) location (given lots of people from abroad or other cities were yolo applying) (b) relevant experience (have they worked with the same stack before?) and (c) school (least weight but obviously relevant), we had about \\~50 quality candidates, or about \\~15 for each role. Quick 30 min intro + technical verbal call with them filtered down the pool to \\~5 per role. We then did more in-depth technical interviews.\n\nFunnily enough, out of the 3 that ended up getting hired, 2 were recommended internally by other coworkers (we have a referral bonus to incentivize them + wanted to hire people who have previously worked with someone on the team who can vouch for their skills) and 1 was hired because they cold DM'd the CEO on twitter (with a surprisingly comprehensive memo on how they'd improve our platform and their relevant experience). \n\nSo yeah, 500+ applications only to hire people we already kinda knew.\n\n_If you're getting into CS_: Attend hackathons/conferences, network aggressively during your internships, contribute to popular open-source projects if only to expand your connections, stay in touch with people from your school and former colleagues, hit up your network to reach out if they've a role you'd be a fit for, take initiative and cold DM people. Whatever it takes to build your network and get your foot through the door.\n\n__AI slop has fried the brains of a lot of new grads.__\n\nLook, I like cursor/claude code as much as anybody else and have no shame in admitting it has boosted my productivity a ton. \n\nBut interviewing people has made me _very_ glad I graduated before LLMs took off.\n\nThis is because a lot of candidates were either (a) blatantly cheating during the interview using some sort of AI tool (could tell from their eye movement and/or how they arrived at the correct answer but couldn't justify how they got there at all) OR (b) didn't have the intuition you'd expect from a software engineer who has spent years coding by throwing stuff at the wall and looking things up (\"learning how to learn\").\n\nI'm personally starting to think AI is a net negative for new grads in that it both nerfs your reasoning muscles (unless u know how to use it properly, i.e as a resource to speed up your learning process wrt core concepts, instead of a black box u mindlessly copy + paste from) AND also forces employers to put higher weight on credentialism (prestige of your school/internships/full time jobs/networking) given the rampant amount of cheating it enables during a remote technical interview.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if in-person interviews became the norm again, which is unfortunate because that would reduce the amount of economic mobility available to someone w/o much experience who say went to a no name school and lives in the middle of nowhere.\n\nGood luck!",

        "content": "*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*\n\nI always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)\n\nI do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.\n\nAs for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.\n\nI did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.\n\nThe first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.\n\nFor context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nOf course, this is just one data point. YMMV\n\nTo those still hunting, good luck.",

Are frequent breakdowns and constant high pressure just part of this career?\n\nI’m honestly worried about my future in this field if this is the standard lifestyle where work completely consumes your life and everyone around you is always in “survival mode.”",

How jobs are hard to come by and it's not worth it, how AI will replace us, etc.\n\nI won't dignify the AI replacing us argument. If you're a junior, please know it's mostly hype.\n\nNow, jobs are indeed harder to come by, but that's because a lot of us (especially in crypto) are comparing to top of market a few years ago when companies would hire anyone with a keyboard, including me lol. (I am exaggerating / joking a bit, of course).\n\nTruth is you need to ask yourself: where else can you find a job that pays 6 figures with no degree only 4 years into it? And get to work in an A/C environment with a comfy chair, possibly from home too? \n\nOh, and also work on technically interesting things and be respected by your boss and co-workers? And you don't have to live in an HCOL either? Nor do you have to work 12 hour days and crazy shifts almost ever?\n\nYou will be hard pressed to find some other career that fits all of these.\n\nEDIT: I've learned something important about 6 hours in. A lot of you just want to complain. Nobody really came up with a real answer to my “you will be hard pressed…” ‘challenge’.",

Yes there are exceptions, but far and few between.\n\nWhy bootcamps grads are awful and should be avoided.\n\n* **Shortcut mentality**, do a couple months bootcamp, yay you a software developer. Absolutely wrong mentality to have if you want to be good\n* **No passion**, people that go through bootcamps are just in it for a job. You will never find passionate software developers (the best kind) that go to these things. I know I know its not always right to require people to \"live\" their jobs. But from a quality standpoint these are the best hires. Bootcampers are never like this. They also have 0 curiosity, things like learning the codebase is implied! But because bootcampers don't care they don't do this.\n* **Spoonfeeding**, A part of being a good developer is resourcefulness, strong debugging, googling skills, and just figuring it out. If you know, you know. Especially with the massive resources online. Even before AI. A bootcamper can't do this, they need to actually be taught and spoon feed everything. Why do you think they paid for a bootcamp for info that can be found online for free! Because it takes effort to do it on your own! which they don't have.\n\nBootcampers and self-taught should not be in the same camp. I'll take self taught driven person anyday over bootcamper\n\nEdit: I actually didn’t expect this to blow up that much…crazy. I did say there are exceptions. But people still raging",

There’s such a strong feeling everything will be taken over by AI but at the same time I feel like my team members aren’t very strong technically where we can even properly identify best practices without AI that I feel AI isn’t going to make that process any better.\n\nHas anybody else faced these issues?

Of my acceptances USC was the best so I decided to commit.\n\nI’m about to finish up my first semester here, but I’m one of the 5-10 domestic students in both of my classes of 200. Nothing against international students, but it seems like 95% of people are here for the visa, and the program itself doesn’t provide much value for jobs. I heard a lot about “omg the Trojan alumni network” but ngl it’s not any better than any other T50, if not worse cuz it’s so oversaturated. money isn’t an issue but I feel like I’m repeating undergrad and wasting 2 years..",

        "content": "I have a computer science degree and couldn't find a job after my return offer from an internship was pulled because of funding. I found a job at a law firm, which I've been regretting ever since I started. There were a lot of red flags when I started. I found out on the first day that I was a contract worker and not a w-2 employee, this was not mentioned in the interview. I also found out a couple days after I started that the job title changed after I interviewed for a business analyst role, I only found out when I looked at an org chart.\n\nThe attorney has barely said a few words to me and anytime she does it feels like she's just talking at me. I haven't gotten any feedback on anything other than random email replies with the word \"good\". I've had 1-on-1's scheduled but they always never show up or get busy. I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long. The following day I'm told I need to only do my job title, then the next week she said I stopped programming and need to figure out how to do both.\n\nLast week, I was asked to meet with the new HR person who has been firing 2-3 people a week since she started. When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks. She said at her old company they were able to build an architecture, build complete features in 1-2 hours and an entire system in less than a year for all the departments that was even HIPAA compliant. I asked how many developers they had and what was their background. She said there were only 2 people and they weren't even developers but was able to \"just get it to work\". I've been there less than 3 months and already deployed an application that decreased their intake process time by over 75% since they did everything manually in word documents. They think I can develop a replacement for a SAAS they don't want to pay for, but want me to \"figure it out\" when I say it's impossible. I know I need to quit, but how bad does it look on my resume since I've only been working a few months?",

Never struggled to find a job (only had 3 software dev jobs in my 20 years career so far though).\n\nI have been at my current company for 10 years now. I asked for a significant raise once about 5 years ago because I realized I was paid less than a colleague even though I was the lead. Other than that I usually get the usual 3% salary bump every year, nothing significant.\n\nIdeally I would prefer to stay at my job. I like the job, my coworkers and the company.  But it's always a challenge to know I could be making that much more (and they also offer 2 more weeks of vacation per year) elsewhere. Both jobs are 100% remote, so no change there.\n\nSo basically my question is, what is the norm out there? Is it \"too much\" to ask for a significant salary raise again if I asked for one (and got it) 5 years ago?",

After graduation, I completed an unpaid full-stack internship, which was mainly frontend development. Since then, I’ve been actively applying to jobs across different types of companies including startups, large firms, remote, on-site and hybrid roles. Despite sending out around 50-70 applications a day, I rarely hear back. Ive even been reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, and barely anything.\n\nI’ve revised my resume countless times. I’ve learned Spring Boot and am currently working on a backend project to showcase that. I also practice LeetCode daily.\n\nOut of desperation, I joined mthree in June, which is supposed to be a training-to-placement program, but they haven’t started training me yet. Feels like a waste of my time.\n\nAtp I feel like im doomed and unemployable. I've applied for QA, support, SWE, data scientist, even HR and solutions engineer. I just dont get it.\n\nFor context, I’m applying throughout the U.S. and a bit in Canada (dual citizen).\n\nWhat the hell do I even pivot into atp? Ive already tried applying for adjacent tech roles.\n\nEdit 1: Since people are commenting on the 50-70 jobs, I know 50-70 sounds intense but I apply to jobs in both Canada and USA. I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to. I also avoid easy apply and apply directly on sites.\n\nEdit 2: Here is my resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adhrvKm0kb0D_pN9hHNyOuiS30Tti5w/view?usp=sharing\n\nSome comments regarding my resume:\nMy resume is a simple Word document. I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.\n\n\nEdit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:\n1. Contribute to open-source projects\n2. Bold technologies in projects/internships\n3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)\n4. Get rid of mthree experience\n5. Reduce technical skills\n6. Remove GPA",

Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small  team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. \n\n4. Disorganized leadership. \"everyone in the department do the same amount of points\"(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.\n\n5. Seemingly little interest in growing me as a professional or if I even like it here. Getting 60 bucks for a bus ticket to a tech event required a whole written document. Not a lot of social opportunities and I have no time too anyways. Asked to be in specialized training programs for cloud skills and got ghosted as usual. Main focus is how I can use gen ai to do more of their work.\n\n6.Still have no goals in workday. Don't know if I'm doing well or not and am afraid to ask at this point. But bright side is I'm learning a LOT, do work with aws, and do code every day. \n\nIs this all just normal and should I kinda suck it up and stick with it or would I most likely just be better off somewhere else?\n\nI can’t switch teams or managers.\n\nEDIT:,\n\noh yeah this is important but I never wanted to do software dev my entire life. I’m getting an mba. Technical leadership is my goal at the moment. I just want a tech basis first, that’s why I have certs in ai and the cloud.

Now I just keep getting screwed over bc this position is overdone.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nHow can I market myself generally as a full stack or pivot to back end? I am learning Java on my own, Spring Boot, Spring AI, whatever I can. I have projects from it.\n\nSo, What would make you hire me as a developer?\n\nI am ok to take a pay cut and go to mid level if I can break into this role. I think my years as a developer can ease me in to back end better than if I were to have started fresh in my early twenties.\n\nThis job search and has been extra difficult for me bc I can’t pass interviews. I never make it past the technical leetcode rounds bc I don’t do well with DSA under watchful eyes. But when I’m on the job and in my zone, I am one of the top performers.\n\nI am good with talking about high level concepts and understanding, can even talk about systems design.\n\nCan I pass interviews by just doing that?\n\nI enjoy being a developer but hate whats become of it. I don’t know how to show my strengths bc the process right now is broken.\n\nHow can I make it?",

Software Engineer, Software Developer, Automation Engineer, Test Engineer, Embedded Software Engineer... if it involves code, and 60-80% of the keywords apply to my experience, I'm probably applying. I'm applying to both remote (preferred) and on-site roles, especially in major tech hubs. I live in NYC and mostly apply to NYC jobs because i likely get filtered out for a lot of other ones. \n\n  \nAbsolute nothing. Zero. No interviews. No screener calls from recruiters. I barely even get the automated \"thanks but no thanks\" emails anymore. It feels like my resume is going directly into a trash can.\n\nI'm 27 and feeling like my career is over before it really began. I'm open to any and all brutal feedback. \n\n  \nBackground:\n\n* Experience: 2.5 YOE at a hardware/software startup. I was unfortunately part of a layoff due to the company losing major government contracts.\n* What I Did: I wasn't just a cog in a wheel. I designed and built the company's core application framework from the ground up using Python and PyQt. This app controlled hardware in real-time, managed data, and visualized results. I have a very hands-on, end-to-end background.\n* Core Skills:\n   * Python: Very strong. Built entire applications, GUIs, data analysis pipelines.\n   * C/C++: Wrote the embedded firmware for all our custom-designed hardware. (which i custom designed PCBs and everything).\n   * SQL (PostgreSQL): Designed and managed the database for all experiment data logging.\n   * Hardware Integration: This is where I might be too \"niche.\" I designed the PCBs (KiCad), synchronized hardware triggers (TTL), and worked with DAQs and many other electrical components.

        "content": "For context, I am in a junior role that is hourly paid and below average pay. I’m not a software engineer but it’s adjacent. In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. \n\nTwo months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. \n\nVery recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. \n\nI went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally.  But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description.  It is very not palatable, I feel that I am an object, and honestly this smells of misogyny.",

I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.\n\nI doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",

        "content": "Hi all!\n\nI know the market is abysmal at the moment, but I'm trying to get into the tech/CS industry. A little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in CS and I graduated in 2021. I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now.  I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.\n\nI was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.\n\nWhere do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry? Trying to decide between focusing on statistics/data analysis using Python, PowerBI, Tableau, etc versus learning full-stack development with Java as backend and Javascript for front-end? Any input or advice is appreciated, thank you :)",

He estimates it would take at the very minimum one year, most likely two years, to get the AI tools capable of even helping us efficiently. Not even to take over our code protection. However, he gave us advice that we should present ourselves as AI experts right now. He said we could do that by  learning how to use the AI tools to take over small tasks as much possible and teaching others to do the same.\n\nSo the question is, where do I go from here? Based on these estimates, I could stay at that FAANG company for a few more years and then job hop to a company that hasn’t migrated to AI software. \n\nBut I also want job security- well the little that is possible in this field. It seems like being a SWE isn’t sustainable long term with the AI migration. Should I start researching other jobs in tech to pivot to? Are there any indications of what that move should be or is it too early to tell?",

So I am seeking opinions!\n\nFor some background, I graduated with my bachelors in chemical engineering with a minor in CS. I am now working as an automation engineer making $100k.\n\nI've always been interested in doing more with CS. I need to program from time to time at my current job, but I haven't had to do \"true\" programming for a while. I'd like to break more into the programming/software side of my industry (or I'd even be interested in a stereotypical software engineering role), but I feel like I am way out of practice at this point, or at least wouldn't know enough to qualify for that kind of position. I also feel like having some official degree in computer science would make me feel more \"legitimate\" when it comes to applying to future jobs.\n\nObviously this would be a big commitment in terms of time/money, but I feel like it could be worth it in the long run? Does anyone have any thoughts, opinions, or experience breaking into a more software engineering role after getting a BS in a different field? Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I am looking at online masters programs that I would be able to do part-time while keeping my full-time job like Georgia Tech's OMSCS or UPenn's MCIT",

Will just share that I am an ex-solo founder with <3 years of experience and non-technical background.\n* I am a US citizen living in a US tech hub.\n* I spent approximately 1 month in the job hunt.\n* Nearly 100% of my interviews were for early-stage AI startups.\n* Applications were 90% LinkedIn. No cover letters or personalized messages.\n* Step 1 was typically vetting call from recruiter or an intro from a founder.\n* Step 2 was typically a technical assessment or take home project.\n* Step 3 was typically a culture fit or technical discussion (eg. system design).\n* Step 4 was typically an onsite (culture fit, system design, problem solving).\n\nSome reflections:\n\n* There is a new wave of AI startup funding, which provides opportunities for people who are willing to learn quickly.\n* I'm a builder. My chances were significantly higher if there was a take home project involved.\n* Startups almost never ask LeetCode problems directly.\n* If startups really like you in one way, they can look past your weaknesses in other areas.\n* Startups hire quickly. If you vibe well and pass everything, an offer can made very quickly.\n\nMy advice for anyone interested in working in the startup space for this new AI wave of funding, especially from non-traditional backgrounds:\n\n* Try to build your own company. This is literally the saying, \"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.\" This immediately shows culture alignment. They are looking for people who have tolerated high risk situations.\n* Practice system design, especially the problem: \"If you're given 10,000 PDF documents, how do you build a chatbot to answer questions about these documents?\" Almost every startup right now is working on some variation of this problem.\n* Both technical and behavioral questions are assessing your ability to tolerate ambiguity. The biggest mistake for any interview in this space is not spending time to properly understand the problem, which often is purposely made vague. I failed many rounds because of this.",

So now three gaps are at risk.\n\nI would say average job tenor was about 2-3 years each jobs (except this one, still here a little under 2 years now).\n\nI quit my first job because it was super toxic, like I was having health issues because of it. Second gap is due to a layoff, but I was really doing well at that job. This one seems to be a downturn in the company as well. I was doing fine at job based on ratings.\n\nI just don't know how to overcome to bias that seems to come with this. I can not lie on my application about timelines, because every job I have taken asks for a background check. Sure, I found my current job with 2 gaps on application, but I don't know about three.\n\nI don't care about the gaps financially, I have savings to last for it. But there does seem to be some bias against this. I know I was pressed by one recruiter who specifically treated me like I was hiding something due to the gaps. As if I was a poor performer who kept losing his job. I also sometimes wonder if that is why I wasn't getting some responses back on jobs. Only reason I have my current job is mainly because of a connection I had.\n\nSo, how do I handle this? What can I do to prevent his being an issue?\n\nThe job market is horrible right now, even for an experienced dev like me. I have thrown a few applications out there and usually would at least get a recruiter calling me, nothing. There is nothing wrong with my application. I've already had it reviewed and it worked fine in my last job search (that was even without a job at the time. I still have my job right now). Granted, I only did a few to test the waters though. But I would at least expect a call back on one.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on this specific topic? I feel frankly worried I need to change careers here soon.",

I work remote and my day-to-day is usually about 2-3 hours of development and half an hour of code reviews. I often take days off and I don't work on most Fridays. \n\nWhile this is a very comfortable situation, I feel very unfulfilled. The obvious, (to me), solution would be to use all my down time to have a side-project but I tried working on a solo app or a game or thinking of my own business. None of these make me happy and I just feel bored of most things. I usually leave the house and walk around the mall just to do something with my day because I have nothing else to do.\n\nWhile I am a critical part of the team, my company is getting more and more manager-based and I'm no longer being asked for architecture input, but I am still being relied upon for development tasks. I have spoken about this to a couple of managers, and while they seem like they understand, I haven't seen any change in this. This isn't a huge deal-breaker and I think I'm looking for _any_ change in order to be less bored.\n\nWhile I think that my feelings are caused by me being idle, I also think what would happen if I wasn't. I don't think I would be any happier if I was busy, and I think I need a complete career change. What is scary to me is that I would need to find something with a comparable salary. I have been looking passively looking looking for another job in my field, (about 5-10 applications every 2 months), but I have only had 2 interviews in 2 years. Maybe I would have more luck if I searched for something in an entirely different field? But would that job also let me work remote and be mostly unsupervised?\n\nI apologize if my situation would be somebody's \"dream job\", and I don't want to sound ungrateful. If somebody else has been in a similar position, I would love to know if they have a solution.",

My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.\n\nFast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. \n\nEX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of  “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”\n\nFirst, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.\n\nI’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. \n\nI do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone. \n\nMy goal here is to simply prevent this type of rhetoric from hurting my career and reputation.\n\nI’m seeking advice on how to handle this situation. Just let it go and roll with the punches, defend myself in the moment, discuss this with someone higher up, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI would like to start this post by saying I'm incredibly grateful to be employed. I graduated in May 2025 with a Computer Science degree and 2 internships at smaller companies. I should've gone harder in college and gotten internships at bigger and better companies as I'm floundering currently with other applications. I got hired off return offer from my junior year Machine Learning internship as a Python developer at the same pharmacy. However - 4 weeks into my job and I have not written a single line of code and it's all IT stuff. It is genuinely crushing as I've been applying to other roles and not hearing back shit (while my younger brother is getting quant role interviews lmfao).\n\nI have no idea what to do. I would ideally like to pivot to a SWE role in Fintech/Defense, and I've been making projects/doing leetcode in my free time to help me apply but I genuinely feel like the no name companies I've worked for in my past have made me a unserious candidate. Haven't gotten a single interview since May. Has anybody ever been in a similar situation?\n\nPS I also never network. This is definitely ruining my odds as I think cold applying is dead for somebody with my shitty experience but it feels like begging",

        "content": "Hello people, I'm currently a junior with around 10 months at my current company, maintaining an application that is frankly quite old. I'm wondering if this will impact my future career growth, as I have options to jump to another company with a more modern tech stack.\n\n- most parts are still with the old .NET 4.8 Framework but some parts in .NET core. They have concrete plans for upgrading to modern .NET, but it won't be so soon (around 3 years)\n- CI CD pipeline using old ass tech, with plenty of environment issues (this has caused me and the team a lot of headaches and time wasted). Not containerised, but plans to be. Modernizations in this area are in the plan as well\n- Not a huge app, around 10 microservices\n- Hosted on AWS but not cloud native, still traditional server architecture\n- Not much scalability concerns\n- However, the product is highly secure and must pass stringent pentests. So plenty of security concerns\n- I get to work with and do the modernization, anything from code to infra migrations. Manager is highly supportive of any effort in this area\n- I get to touch on all areas of the albeit old application, from frontend to backend to devops and security\n- only one team of devs+QA of around 15 people\n\n\nWhat I will miss out on:\n- Scalability concerns. The product is meant to be low key b2b, there are basic scalability concerns but not big tech level where scalability is top priority.\n- Cloud native infra: I'm seeing most companies have already left the server architecture behind and adopt cloud native.\n- It feels bad still using Remote Desktop Connection and windows sucks major ass\n- Modern devops\n- Modern tech\n- Large company things with the big tech feel. I can't put this exactly into words but when your company has an engineering blog there is just this vibe. I feel like I'm missing out.\n\nI'd like to know if my concerns are legit. Thanks!",

Great compensation, great team, great mentorship, great WLB, great name to have on the resume.\n\nThe compensation is more than I've ever had. The position is fully remote. The company hasn't done any \"mass\" layoffs. The team (except one guy) has great WLB. In fact my manager has told me not to be like that guy, since he's not your average joe. The company specifically says they don't reward long hours.\n\nYet I find this all makes me anxious. I've worked 15 hour days just because I want to feel useful. No one asks me to do this, but everything seems to point to this being a complete fluke and it can all go away in a snap. \n\nIt's fully remote, in a saturated field, great benefits and pay, and many people have called it their dream company. In other words, I feel incredibly replaceable and it makes me work twice as hard.\n\nI feel like I might be on my way to burnout if I don't correct myself. Has anyone been in this position before and how did you deal with it?\n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello! I'm in a weird predicament and I'd appreciate some advice. Right after graduating, I started working at a job making less than 100k. I have been there for the last 4 years. Towards the last 6 months, I was pretty unmotivated and was completely coasting due to low pay and also not having fun things to work on. One thing to note is that this was a very small startup and I was the first engineer to be hired so I learned a LOT over the years.\n\nFew months ago I decided enough is enough and I started applying and I somehow made it into FAANG.\n\nI'm very happy and proud of myself. I'm now making more money than I ever imagined and I'm more motivated than ever. I want to climb this ladder and shoot for the moon. I know I have the capabilities and I come from a poor family so money is certainly a huge motivation. I'm also a huge nerd and I love to learn. The technologies used in this company are completely different than what I'm used to and I've always been curious on the inner workings of platforms that work at massive scale so having access to all these docs and the entire codebase is incredible.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes I feel like I may be full sending it way too hard. I know the general consensus is that when you start a new job, you shouldn't go too crazy and set unrealistic expectations because you can't keep the same motivation as when you just started over a long period of time.\n\nI just got handed my first project and I was told that while my teammates (who have been here 3-4 years) can probably knock it out in 1-2 weeks, they expect me to take 3-4 weeks (and also said it's totally okay if I take more).\n\nHowever I've been so excited and itching to code and learn that I've completed around 60% of it in 3 days.\n\nSo my question is, should I purposefully slow down?\n\nOn one hand, I want to prove my worth and get promoted to senior as fast as possible because I truly believe I gained the ability to work at that level at the startup, but on the other hand I don't want to set unrealistic expectations.\n\nHow should I go about balancing all this?",
