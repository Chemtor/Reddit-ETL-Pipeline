        "content": "I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert in Python DE. It's actually something I recently started because most of my experience was in Scala.\n\nBut I've had to use Pandas sporadically in the past 5 years and recently at my current company some of the engineers/DS have been selecting Pandas for some projects/quick scripts\n\nAnd I just hate it, tbh. I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.\n\nPerformance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.\n\nUsage-Wise, this is where I hate it.\n\nIt's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. \n\nPandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.\n\nToday I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.\n\nIt just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.\n\nI know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",

You can find the source code and a detailed overview here:Â [https://github.com/Xadra-T/End2End-Data-Pipeline](https://github.com/Xadra-T/End2End-Data-Pipeline)\n\nFirst image: an overview of the the pipeline.  \nSecond image: a view of the dashboard.\n\n**Main Flow**\n\n* Python: Generates simple, fake user events.\n* Kafka: Ingests data from Python and streams it to ClickHouse.\n* Airflow: Orchestrates the workflow by\n   * Periodically streaming a subset of columns from ClickHouse to MinIO,\n   * Triggering Spark to read data from MinIO and perform processing,\n   * Sending the analysis results to the dashboard.\n\n**Recommended Sources**\n\nThese are the main sources I used, and I highly recommend checking them out:\n\n* [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/): An excellent, hands-on course on DE, updated every year!\n* [Knowledge Amplifier](https://www.youtube.com/@KnowledgeAmplifier1): Has a great playlist on Kafka for Python developers.\n* [Code With HSN](https://www.youtube.com/@hasanxdev): In-depth videos on how Kafka works.\n\nThis was a great hands-on learning experience in integrating multiple components. I specifically chose this tech stack to gain practical experience with the industry-standard tools. I'd love to hear your feedback on the project itself and especially on what to pursue next. If you're working on something similar or have questions about any parts of the project, I'd be happy to share what I learned along this journey.\n\nEdit: **To clarify the choice of tools: This stack is intentionally built for high data volume to simulate real-world, large-scale scenarios.**",

I know Python well, so working in Python for my initial contribution would probably let me focus on understanding the codebase itself rather than struggling with language syntax.\n- Iâm attracted to many projects, but my main worry is picking one thatâs not regularly used at workâI'm concerned Iâll need to invest a lot more time outside of work to really get up to speed, both with the tool and the ecosystem around it.\n\nProject choices Iâm evaluating:\n- dbt-core: My first choice, since we rely on it for all data transformations at work. Itâs Python-based, which fits my skills, and would likely help me get a better grip on both the tool and large-scale engineering practices. The downside: it may soon see fewer new features or even eventual deprecation in favor of dbt-fusion (Rust). While Iâm open to learning Rust, that feels like a steep learning curve for a first contribution, and Iâm concerned Iâd struggle to ramp up.\n- Airflow: My second choice. Also Python, core to our workflows, likely to have strong long-term support, but not directly database-related.\n- Clickhouse / Polars / DuckDB: We use Clickhouse at work, but its internals (and those of Polars and DuckDB) look intimidatingâwith the added challenge of needing to learn a new (compiled) language. I suspect the learning curve here would be pretty steep.\n- Scikit-learn: Python-based, and interesting to me thanks to my data science background. Could greatly help reinforce algorithmic skills, which seem like a required step to understand what happens inside a database. However, I donât use it at work, so I worry the experience wouldnât translate or stick as well, and it would require a massive investment of time outside of work\n\nI would love any advice on how to choose the right open-source project, how to balance learning new tech versus maximizing work relevance, and any tips for first-time contributors.\n",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Hi r/dataengineering \n\nWhen building high-performance storage systems, the performance bottleneck in write-intensive scenarios often lies in the in-memory data structures. Traditional MemTables based on Skip-Lists or B-Trees, while excellent at maintaining data order, can become a performance drag under high-concurrency writes due to their complex internal node operations.\n\nTo break through this barrier, my colleague and I designed and open-sourced a brand new, high-performance in-memory KV storage engine: **Columnar MemTable**. It leverages a suite of modern C++17 techniques and clever concurrency designs to achieve astonishing performance. In our benchmarks, its concurrent write throughput reached **\\~17 million ops/s**, 3.5 times that of a traditional Skip-List implementation. Single-threaded batch writes hit an incredible **\\~52 million ops/s**, a 50x improvement over Skip-Lists. In mixed read-write scenarios, its performance soared to **\\~61 million ops/s**, leading by a factor of 4.\n\nThis blog post will serve as a tutorial, taking you on a deep dive into the internal world of Columnar MemTable to dissect the core design philosophy and implementation details behind its high performance.\n\n**Core Design Philosophy: Separate the Hot Path, Process Asynchronously**\n\nThe foundation of Columnar MemTable's high performance can be summarized in one sentence: **Completely separate the write hot path from the background processing cold path.**\n\n* **An Extremely Optimized Write Path:** All write operations go into an \"active block\" (FlashActiveBlock) tailor-made for concurrent writes. At this stage, we don't care about global data order; we pursue the absolute maximum write speed and lowest latency.\n* **Asynchronous Organization and Consolidation:** Once an active block is full, it is \"sealed\" and seamlessly handed over as a whole to a dedicated background thread.\n* **Leisurely Background Processing:** The background thread is responsible for sorting the sealed data, converting its format, building indexes, and even performing compaction. All these time-consuming operations are completely decoupled from the foreground write path, ensuring stable and efficient write performance.\n\n# A Simple Architecture Diagram\n\n[Columnar MemTable Design](https://preview.redd.it/vzchkgjz43qf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74fb77e99e8e0f228c77ed1e8b48ce92e02ee96)\n\nAs you can see, Columnar MemTable is essentially an in-memory LSM-Tree. However, because the MemTable itself has a limited size, it doesn't generate a huge number of sorted blocks (usually just a dozen or so). Therefore, in-memory compaction isn't strictly necessary. My implementation provides a configuration option to enable or disable compaction for in-memory sorted blocks, with it being disabled by default.\n\nNext, we'll dive into the code to break down the key components that realize this philosophy.\n\n**Deep Dive into the Write Path (The \"Hot\" Zone)**\n\nThe write path is the key to performance. We minimize lock contention through sharding and a clever memory allocation mechanism.\n\n**1. Sharding**\n\nLike all high-performance concurrent components, sharding is the first line of defense. ColumnarMemTable maintains an array of Shards. By taking the hash of a key modulo the number of shards, we distribute different keys to different shards, which greatly reduces concurrency conflicts.\n\n        \n      // Locate the corresponding Shard using the key's hash\n    size_t GetShardIdx(std::string_view key) const { \n      return hasher_(key) & shard_mask_;\n    } \n\n**2. FlashActiveBlock: The Core of Write Operations**\n\nAll current writes within a Shard are handled by a FlashActiveBlock. It consists of two parts:\n\n* **ColumnarRecordArena**: A memory allocator designed for concurrent writes.\n* **ConcurrentStringHashMap**: A quasi-lock-free hash index for fast point lookups within the active block.\n\n**3. ColumnarRecordArena**\n\nTraditional memory allocators require locking under high concurrency, whereas ColumnarRecordArena almost completely eliminates contention between write threads by using Thread-Local Storage (TLS) and atomic operations.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Thread-Exclusive Data Blocks:** The first time a thread writes, it's allocated its own ThreadLocalData, which contains a series of DataChunks. A thread only writes to its own DataChunk, avoiding data races at the source.\n* **Lock-Free In-Block Allocation:** How do we safely allocate space within a DataChunk for multiple threads (although by design TLS is mostly accessed by a single thread, we aim for maximum robustness)? The answer is a 64-bit atomic variable, positions\\_.\n   * The **high 32 bits** store the number of allocated records.\n   * The **low 32 bits** store the number of bytes used in the buffer.\n\nWhen a thread needs to allocate space, it enters a Compare-And-Swap (CAS) loop:\n\n        \n      // Simplified core logic of AllocateAndAppend\n    uint64_t old_pos = chunk->positions_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);\n    while (true) {\n        // Parse old record index and buffer position\n        uint32_t old_ridx = static_cast<uint32_t>(old_pos >> 32);\n        uint32_t old_bpos = static_cast<uint32_t>(old_pos);\n    \n        // Check if there's enough space\n        if (old_ridx >= kRecordCapacity || old_bpos + required_size > kBufferCapacity) {\n            break; // Not enough space, need to switch to a new Chunk\n        }\n    \n        // Calculate the new position\n        uint64_t new_pos = (static_cast<uint64_t>(old_ridx + 1) << 32) | (old_bpos + required_size);\n    \n        // Atomically update the position\n        if (chunk->positions_.compare_exchange_weak(old_pos, new_pos, ...)) {\n            // CAS successful, allocation complete\n            record_idx = old_ridx;\n            buffer_offset = old_bpos;\n            goto allocation_success;\n        }\n        // CAS failed, means another thread interfered. Retry the loop.\n    } \n\nThis approach avoids heavyweight mutexes (std::mutex), achieving safe and efficient memory allocation with only lightweight atomic operations.\n\n**4. ConcurrentStringHashMap: A Fast Index for Active Data**\n\nOnce data is written to ColumnarRecordArena, we need a fast way to find it. ConcurrentStringHashMap is designed for this. It's based on linear probing and uses atomic tags to handle concurrency.\n\n* **Tag Mechanism:** Each slot has an 8-bit atomic tag. EMPTY\\_TAG (0xFF) means the slot is empty, and LOCKED\\_TAG (0xFE) means it's being written to. When inserting, a thread first tries to CAS the tag from EMPTY\\_TAG to LOCKED\\_TAG. If successful, it safely writes the data and then updates the tag to its final value.\n* **Lock-Free Reads:** Read operations are completely lock-free. They just need to atomically read the tag and other data for comparison. This makes point lookups (Get) in the active block extremely fast.\n\n**From Hot to Cold: Sealing and Background Processing**\n\nThings get more complex when a FlashActiveBlock reaches its size threshold.\n\n1. **Seal**\n\n* A foreground thread acquires a lightweight SpinLock for the shard.\n* It marks the current active\\_block\\_ as sealed.\n* It creates a new, empty FlashActiveBlock to replace it.\n* It places the sealed block into a global background processing queue.\n* It releases the lock.\n\nThis entire process is very fast, with minimal impact on foreground writes.\n\n**2. Background Worker Thread (BackgroundWorkerLoop):**\n\nAn independent background thread continuously pulls sealed blocks from the queue.\n\n* **Data Consolidation:** It iterates through all the data in the sealed block's ColumnarRecordArena, converting it from a fragmented, multi-threaded layout into a compact, contiguous columnar block (ColumnarBlock).\n* **Columnar Storage (Structure-of-Arrays):** ColumnarBlock stores all keys, values, and types in separate std::vectors. This layout dramatically improves cache locality, especially for future analytical scan queries (OLAP), as it allows reading only the required columns.\n* **Parallel Sorting:** After consolidation, the background thread calls a Sorter (defaulting to ParallelRadixSorter) to sort all records in the ColumnarBlock by key. Radix sort is highly efficient for strings, and parallelizing it fully utilizes multi-core CPUs.\n* **Generate SortedColumnarBlock:** Once sorted, a final, immutable, read-only SortedColumnarBlock is generated. To accelerate future reads, we also build:\n   * **Bloom Filter:** To quickly determine if a key might exist, effectively filtering out a large number of queries for non-existent keys.\n   * **Sparse Index:** We sample a key every N records (e.g., 16). When querying, we first use the sparse index to quickly locate an approximate range, then perform a binary search within that small range, avoiding the overhead of a binary search over the entire dataset.\n\nAs you can see, this SortedColumnarBlock is very similar to a Level 0 SSTable in an LSM-Tree.\n\n**The Complete Query Path**\n\nWhat is the lifecycle of a Get(key) request? It searches through data from newest to oldest to ensure it reads the latest version:\n\n1. **Check the Active Block:** First, it searches in the current shard's FlashActiveBlock using its ConcurrentStringHashMap. This is the hottest, newest data and usually results in the fastest hits.\n2. **Check Sealed Blocks:** If not found, it iterates in reverse through the list of sealed\\_blocks in the shard that have been sealed but not yet processed by the background thread.\n3. **Check Sorted Blocks:** If still not found, it finally iterates in reverse through the list of SortedColumnarBlocks that have been processed. Here, it first uses the Bloom filter and sparse index for quick pruning before performing a precise lookup.\n\nIf the key is not found anywhere, or if the last record found is a Delete type, it returns std::nullopt.\n\nHere, to ensure memory safety, we need to maintain a reference count while searching the Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks to prevent the MemTable from deallocating them. However, incrementing a shared\\_ptr's reference count on the Get path is very expensive and prevents Get operations from scaling across multiple cores. Using raw pointers, on the other hand, introduces memory safety issues.\n\nOur solution uses a **thread-local shared\\_ptr** and maintains a **global sequence number**. When the set of Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks is modified (e.g., a block is sealed), the global sequence number is incremented. When a Get operation occurs, it checks if its locally cached sequence number matches the global one.\n\n* **If they match (the common case)**, the thread-local shared\\_ptrs are still valid. The query can proceed using these cached pointers, completely avoiding an expensive atomic ref-count operation.\n* **If the local number is outdated**, the thread must update its local shared\\_ptr cache and sequence number (a much rarer event). This design allows our Get performance to scale effectively on multi-core systems.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work**\n\nAlthough Columnar MemTable excels at writes and point lookups, it's not a silver bullet.\n\n**Adaptation Issues with RocksDB**\n\nThe current design is not well-suited to be a drop-in MemTable plugin for RocksDB. A core requirement for RocksDB is an Iterator that can traverse all data in the MemTable in sorted order. In our implementation, data in the FlashActiveBlock is unsorted. To provide a globally sorted iterator, we would have to sort the active block's data on-the-fly every time an iterator is created and merge it with the already sorted blocks. This on-the-fly sorting is extremely expensive and completely defeats our write-optimized design philosophy. Therefore, perfectly adapting to RocksDB would require further design changes, such as maintaining some degree of local order within the active block. One idea is to replace FlashActiveBlock with a skiplist, but that would essentially turn it into an in-memory RocksDB (haha).\n\n**Ideal Use Cases**\n\nThe current ColumnarMemTable is specifically designed for scenarios like:\n\n* **Extremely high write throughput and concurrent point lookups:** For example, real-time metrics monitoring, user behavior logging, and other write-heavy, read-light workloads.\n* **In-memory buffer for OLAP engines:** Its native columnar format makes it a perfect in-memory staging area for OLAP databases (like ClickHouse). When data is flushed from memory to disk, it can be done directly in the efficient columnar format. Even while in memory, its columnar properties can be leveraged for pre-aggregation calculations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nColumnarMemTable is an exploration and a breakthrough in traditional MemTable design. By separating the hot write path from background processing and designing highly optimized data structures for eachâa thread-local arena allocator, a quasi-lock-free hash index, parallel radix sort, and columnar blocks with Bloom filters and sparse indexesâwe have successfully built an in-memory KV engine with outstanding performance under write-intensive and mixed workloads.\n\nI hope this design deep dive has given you some inspiration.

        "author": "lilde1297",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi. Iâve been doing data engineering for 3 years now and Iâm mostly self taught. I am the primary data engineer for my team, which resides outside of IT. My tech stack is currently python scripts running on cron. My IT has a seperate etl stack using SSIS. This is not an SSIS rant. This is an honest inquiry about how to proceed with the situation at my job.  \n\nMy team started using Python before I was hired and to my knowledge without the approval of the dba. I now mange the environment and I am looking to get a modern set up with Airflow running in azure on a couple VMs. The dba is not happy that I donât use SSIS and I feel kind of stuck since I was hired to write Python anyway.  Iâm also watching more people in my organization develop Python skills so I feel like it makes sense for me to align with the skills of the org as a whole. We also just aquired Snowflake and I feel like Python works better with that kind of data warehouse.\n\nNow I do understand some of my dba point of view. My team just did their own thing and he feels that was wrong. I donât know the whole story as to why things ended up this way and Iâve heard critiques of both IT and my team.   My environment wasnât setup with the best security in mind. I am working to rectify this but Iâve bumped heads with the dba on a solution because he never feels the security is enough and doesnât trust me fully. I am trying to run Airflow on azure as I said and my plan is to store anything sensitive in key vault and call the secrets at runtime.   This should be secure enough to get his sign off but thatâs to be seen.\n\nNow when it comes to what tool to use(Python, ssis, airflow, etc.) I feel stuck between everyone. On one hand my dba wants to say SSIS and thatâs it. Iâve tried SSIS and I prefer Python. If needed I could use SSIS but Iâve brought up other issues such as my dba doesnât use CI/CD or version control and I think that is very important in a modern setup.  Additionally the dba didnât have other people on his team who knew and a could support ssis until recently and their still new to it.  On the flip side I know that the dba team doesnât have any people who know Airflow or Python  so I understand when my dba says that he canât support Python.  I know there are people outside of that team and IT who do know Python though.\n\nWhen it comes down to it I guess Iâm trying to figure out if Iâm making the right call and telling my dba that Iâm going to use Airflow and make it as secure as possible or should I give in because ssis is what he knows? Also should he even have as much say as he does in the agency data engineering stack when he is the dba and he doesnât develop the pipelines himself?  \n\nAlso Iâd love to hear if any of you have had similiar experiences or are in companies where there are different data engineering stacks that live outside of IT.",

This drastically reduces data transfer overhead, improves latency, and makes real-time analytics on large datasets much more feasible. Yet we see surprisingly few solutions implementing thisâprobably because it requires a shift in mindset from traditional REST/JSON pipelines and more sophisticated serialization/deserialization logic.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from data engineers whoâve experimented with this approach!",

I'm a nerd that likes to be deep in the weeds. I don't like to create work or mentor, I like to be heads down doing development. I'd rather just be assigned work and do it, not try to come up with new work. Not everyone is meant to be a leader. And I hate this whole leadership theme.

Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.\n* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.\n\n**Why did I even bother writing this?**\n\nI found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldnât find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, Iâve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n**nexos.ai**\n\nQuick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.\n* Cost alert messages, so we donât blow our budget in a week.\n* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.\n* It has an API gateway.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.\n\n**Langfuse**\n\nQuick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.\n* The A/B testing feature is awesome.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Itâs open-source, so weâll see how it goes.\n\n**Portkey**\n\nQuick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.\n* Robust logging features.\n* Dev-centric UI.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.\n\n**Arize Phoenix**\n\nQuick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Slack alerts are super convenient.\n* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.\n\n**Overall**\n\nI feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai. Itâs just all there available out of the box, with the observability, management, and guardrails menu providing the exact feature set we were looking for.Â \n\nClose second for me is Langfuse due to its open-source nature and good documentation coverage.",

We have data in snowflake that we want to sync with mongo db so that it can easily be queried by an API.\n\n In my mind, the ideal solution would be to have a task that consumes the stream and pushes the changes to mongodb. Another option is to use an existing service we have to query the stream for changes manually keeping track of a pointer for what changes have been synced.\n\nI'm interested in any opinions on the process. I'm considering if the ideal solution is really ideal and worth continuing to troubleshoot (I'm having trouble getting the task to find the function and calling the function directly in sql gives DNS errors resolving the SRV connection string) or if I'm chosen the wrong path and should go with the another option.\n\nThanks!",

I feel like the field is slowly dying and companies are putting more emphasis on ML, and ideally ML engineers who can do some basic data engineering and modeling (whatever that means). Same for lead roles, they put more focus on ML and GenAI than the actual platform to efficiently support any data product. DE and data platform features can be built by regular SW engineers and teams now, this is what I get from various interviews with hiring managers.\n\nI have applied to a few jobs and most of them required take homes where I had to showcase my DS/ML expertise although (a) the job descriptions never mentioned anything related to ML, and (b) I clearly asked them in screening or hiring manager interviews whether they require such and claimed they didn't.\n\nAnd then I get rejected because I don't know my ML algorithms. Credentials, past experience and contributions mean nothing, even if I worked on a competitor or SaaS business that they paid for or have adjacent domain knowledge or I have built a similar DE/ML platform as they are looking for.\n\nMy post is not about the broken hiring experience, but on the field's future. I love data and its tooling but now everything has become full with GenAI; people don't care about DB/DWH/Kafka/whatever tool expertise, data quality, performance or data products you built. I also work on GenAI projects and agents, but honestly I don't see a bright future for data engineering. CTOs and VPs seem to put more emphasis on DS/ML people than DE. This was always the norm but I believe this has become more prevalent the past few years. Thoughts?",

For context we would probably be hosting it in GCP for 100-200 users with a couple gigs of documents that should be easily handleable by basic pdf processing. Mostly just want to understand how much time it takes to set up self hosting, set up a few connectors and google oauth, as well as how high quality the search and response generation is.",

The current architecture looks like this: I have some scheduled python jobs that scrape the data, raw data lands on S3 partitioned by hours, then data is processed and clean data lands in a Postgres DB with Timescale enabled (I'm using TigerData). Then the data is served through an API (with FastAPI) with endpoints that allow to fetch historical data etc.\n\nEverything works as expected and I had fun building it as I never worked with Timescale. However, after a month I have collected already like 1 TB of raw data (around 100 GB on timescale after compression) . Which is fine for S3, but TigerData costs will soon be unmanageable for a side project.\n\nAre there any cheap ways to serve time series data without sacrificing performance too much? For example, getting rid of the DB altogether and just store both raw and processed on S3. But I'm afraid that this will make fetching the data through the API very slow.

I've set this up via the Airflow config file and a custom HTML template, which generally works well.\n\nHowever, the problem arises when some DAGs fail: they can have up to 30 concurrent tasks that may all fail at once, which floods my inbox with multiple failure emails for the same DAG run.\n\nI came across a related discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75255440/aggregate-failure-notifications-into-a-single-email-for-a-dag-in-airflow), but with that method, I wasn't able to pass the task instance context into the HTML template defined in the config file.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this issue? I'd imagine it's a common problem, how do you prevent being overwhelmed by failure notifications and instead get a single, aggregated email per DAG run? Would love to hear about your approach or any best practices you can recommend!\n\nThanks!",

        "author": "IntelligentNet9593",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I recently joined a small research organization (like 2-8 people) that uses several Access databases for all their administrative record keeping, mainly to store demographic info for study participants. They built a GUI in Python that interacts with these databases via SQL, and allows for new records to be made by filling out fields in a form. \n\nI have some computer science background, but I really do not know much at all about database management or SQL. I recently implemented a search engine in this GUI that displays data from our Access databases. Previously, people were sharing the same Access database files on a network drive and opening them concurrently to look up study participants and occasionally make updates. I've been reading and apparently this is very much not good practice and invites the risk for data corruption, the database files are almost always locked during the workday and the Access databases are not split into a front end and back end. \n\n  \nThis has been their workflow for about 5 years though, with thousands of records, and they haven't had any major issues. However, recently, we've been having an issue of new records being sporadically deleted/disappearing from one of the databases. It only happens in one particular database, the one connected to the GUI New Record form, and it seemingly happens randomly. If I were to make 10 new records using the form on the GUI, probably about 3 of those records might disappear despite the fact that they do immediately appear in the database right after I submit the form. \n\nI originally implemented the GUI search engine to prevent people from having the same file opened constantly, but I actually think the issue of multiple users is worse now because everyone is using the search engine and accessing data from the same file(s) more quickly and frequently than they otherwise were before. \n\nI'm sorry for the lengthy post, and if I seem unfamiliar with database fundamentals (I am). My question is, how can I best optimize their data management and workflow given these conditions? I don't think they'd be willing to migrate away from Access, and we are currently at a road block of splitting the Access files into front end and back end since it's on a network drive of a larger organization that blocks Macros, and apparently, the splitter wizard necessitates Macros. This can probably be circumvented. \n\nThe GUI search engine works so well and has made things much easier for everyone. I just want to make sure our data doesn't keep getting lost and that this is sustainable. ",

Ive come up with my own personal theory that people who say this are either investors or advertisers and gain something from gassing up AI as much as they do.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Tl:dr; I want to create an (ios + android) app that tells when the river has burst so people can evacuate. Iâve little to 0 experience in coding.\n\nSorry, this is going to be long so I divided it into backstory and technical questions:\n\nââBackstoryââ\n\nI live in a small valley town in Malaysia. That said when it floods, ANNUALLY, it becomes a choke point for people travelling to, from and between cities, suburbs and rural areas.\n\nLast year, while a young couple died trying to feed stranded families with babies in cars, the young wife fatally fell into a storm drain (hidden by deep flood waters). Now, just last week it rained again and people are stranded - and I just heard that three people have died in the span of less than a week due to record level landslides in this region.\n\nLook, everyone knows everyone in this part of the world. So when someone dies, everyone is devastated. And it saddens me that it happens to the those with the best or intentions. \n\nNot to mentions property and income losses. Iâm talking those who just bought a car to go to work and now itâs CAKED with silt while some have to spend tens of thousands replacing books, devices and furniture cause they didnât have time to move their stuff elsewhere. \n\nYou might be thinking why donât they move their cars uphill or carry your fridge upstairs when it rains? Would you do that every time it rains? Itâs a tropical country anyway. Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. \n\nIf only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. \n\nAgain I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that thatâs just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so itâs like an early prevention mechanism. Iâm thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. \n\nI realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if itâs just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. Iâll sleep more peacefully.\n\nââTechnical Questionsââ\n\nApp: \n1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?\n2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.\n3. How âsimpleâ will this app be? Iâm not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.\n\nFlood detection:\n1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?\n2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?\n\nGeneral:\n- Is this possible? How long will this take me? \n\nNB: Iâm gonna fund this entirely on my own and Iâll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.\n\nObviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly donât know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM. \n\nThank you in advance.\n",

None of them really knew programming... and the guy they hired to lead it is gone. Because of that, I (and some fellow interns who are game developers) were tasked to increase the performance of the project. Naturally I inquired about their Github first and as a response I heard their Github was \"broken\". I initially thought going back a few pushes would fix it... but when I asked for more details it wasn't necessarily that their Github was broken... rather that they didn't have one.\n\nThey didn't work with Github.\n\nThe entire project was made and maintained on literally. A single. Computer.\n\nNow, I'm not a software god by any means, far from it, but I'm fairly certain Github is necessary for working with multiple people. I've learned 2 issues. The first one being that Github doesn't accept files larger than 100mb, and I'm currently learning how to work with Github Large Files to remedy that issue, as well as testing which files I can delete that won't even affect the project. However the second problem is that Github doesn't accept repositories larger than 5Gb? Mine is about 17Gb...\n\nI've already been looking up on reddit and Stackoverflow for advice but it seems that not many run into a problem like this. If anyone can share any thoughts with me would be highly appreciated.",

I used to love this programâespecially web development, dsa with Java, database management, and digital logicsâbut that was during 1st and 2nd year. I lost motivation because every semester we had to shift into a totally different topic, just after Iâd started enjoying the last one. I was at my peak during those years, then crashed hard when the subject switched to things that didnât interest me, like PHP and all that.\n\nAnyway, now I feel like Iâm back at zero, taking a refresher, and Iâve realized that school never really taught us how to actually apply what we learned. They just gave us small projects, and I thought I was doing greatâbut then I asked myself, âWhatâs next?â Honestly, I think Iâve learned more teaching myself and watching tutorials than I did in school.

Please donât judge meâI already do enough of that myself. I just really need help and advice: what should I dooo??\n\nPeople have told me to just focus on one thing, and I didâIâve been learning web development these past few weeks because I used to really like it. But then I see a lot of people saying beginner web developers wonât be needed anymore since AI is already as good as senior devs. Now Iâm slacking again, questioning whether web development is even worth studying. I thought it would be a good starter since itâs beginner-friendly, but now I really donât know what to doooo.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks, everyone! I'll keep your advices in mind.

We had to write our own code in that class based on established projects. I've also attempted far more complex projects based on tutorials meant to walk through nearly every step. In total, I've spent maybe 40-60 hours trying to code with C# and Java depending on the project. But to be completely honest, if you asked me to make something as simple as a calculator, I literally wouldn't even be able to tell you what the first WORD in that code would be. For some reason my brain has absorbed absolutely NOTHING about syntax or even setting up projects, and it's extraordinarily frustrating. Every tutorial or class I've ever done, I have actually been typing out all code used, and yet NOTHING sticks in my brain. I glean loose concepts, but the languages themselves leave no impression on me, and I have no idea if this is normal or not. I'm 22. If I literally can't even code \"Hello World\" for the 30th time in C# or Java because I don't remember the syntax or formatting, should I just give up trying to learn by myself (as opposed to enrolling in an in-person program)? Is coding even for me? \n\nTo clarify: I understand and have learned a lot more about how code works in those 40-60 hours. The issue is the language has no place in my brain. If I am asked to code by myself, I could tell you the general concept of what I'd need to do, and that's it. The code itself, the actual words and their order, I couldn't tell you if you put a gun to my head.",

Whenever I have done any project, I tend to either use one language and its framework. In the case of Java for example, I use Springboot and Kafka (With some basic bootstrap for the frontend) and JavaFX for the graphic interface.\n\nBut with all of these languages how can I use them for a project? I know python tends to be used for scrypting or for AI integration but I have not delved into that nor I have had the need.\n\nTo those that were in this situation or those that are in it, how do you tend to maximize/add other languages into your project? I do not say this for the sake of making things more difficult, I simply want to find a way in which I can make better projects or find a better value of what I'm learning. I fear that this year it might end up being a year in which I won't be able to do any real advancements because I will have to keep studying keywords, libraries and such instead of making actual projects that get you somewhere.\n\nEDIT: I have to study it because the classes this year demands it, my intention was to mostly stick with one until I feel that I'm more of an expert with it",

After doing some research, I found out that C is considered a solid first language because it helps you understand the core principles of programming.\n\nRight now, Iâm learning C through C Programming: A Modern Approach. Itâs not that Iâm particularly interested in C itself, but I do want to get better at coding in general.\n\nMy question is:\n\nAfter finishing this C book, should I keep going deeper into C, or should I move on to another language?\n\nWhat programming languages should I learn after C if my main goal is to improve my coding skills?\n\nAre there languages that are both good for learning and getting better at coding while also being useful for getting a job in the future?\n\nIâm currently considering either Python or C++ as my next language, Python because everyone recommends it to beginners, and C++ because it builds on C and includes all of C.\n\nThanks in advance!",

After years of precarious work in art, at 30 I realized I wouldn't be able to earn enough to support a family, or buy a home.\n\nSo I started looking for a job that would allow me to work anywhere and put some money aside. A job I could learn on my own, without attending expensive degree, but with lots of practice and independent study, that would pay well and be in high demand by companies.\n\nThat's how I stumbled upon the role of developer. I'd like to point out that I have excellent problem-solving and logic skills, but little computer science knowledge, so I'm starting from scratch.\n\nAfter 6â12 months of study/practice, I'd like to start as a junior and already have a solid portfolio.\n\nThe scenario starts from scratch: Month 1â3 â Python basics, logic, mini scripts. Months 4â6 â I learn Django/Flask (web backend) or a clear area. I complete my first public project. Months 7â12 â I build 1â2 serious projects (e.g., a full web app, an app with an interface), put everything on GitHub, and start applying.\n\nWith this path, would I reach a credible junior level? And then, can I find real opportunities, especially if I accept internships, entry-level positions, or initial freelance work? Or is it just wishful thinking?\n\nThe key is to specialize in a clear niche (e.g., Django backend) and avoid chasing \"impossible\" ads that seek 10 roles at once. But which one? Do you have any advice?\n\nThank you so much.",

Most of my friends who enrolled in this program have already left, and Iâm one of the few still sticking with it.\n\nHereâs my situation:\n\n* Iâm 21 and just starting my degree. If all goes well, Iâd finish in about 3â4 years.\n* At my university in Canada, internships are mandatory. Without them, you canât graduate. The school provides some help, but itâs still hard to find one â for some people, it takes 6+ months or even a year.\n* Iâm married, and I really want to finish as quickly as possible so I donât make my wife wait longer than necessary.\n* On a personal note, my mother passed away this past January from a brain tumor. Before she passed, I wanted her to see me married, so I made that choice out of love for her and my wife. I know I have to carry the responsibility of that decision, but I donât regret it.\n\nLooking ahead, Iâd like to specialize in AI ,specifically deep learning and machine learning. I know thatâs a path that might require pursuing a masterâs degree or additional studies after my bachelorâs.\n\nAnd about passion, people often say âif youâre not passionate, switch programs.â Iâd say I am passionate, but in my own way. What I really love is solving problems, whether itâs in math, physics, or programming. Coding itself is fun, but Iâm not the type who will stay up all night coding just for the sake of it. For me, the thrill is in figuring out the solution.\n\nSo far, Iâve only done one or two very small side projects, and Iâm starting a third one (a bit harder, I want to make a simple GPT wrapper). Theyâre nothing big, but Iâm slowly building up.\n\nMy concern is: should I stick with software engineering?\n\nBy the time I graduate, will it still be worth it? Or is the field going to be so saturated that even with a degree and internships, finding a job will be tough?\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation,  balancing marriage, studies, and an uncertain job market? Do you think staying in software engineering is a good idea, or should I start reconsidering now before I go too far down this path?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

Because the text editor spits out the ASCII codes, it will look like gibberish. Representing the data I need stored as integers is easy. The problem is that Iâm not sure how to separate different pieces of information. Letâs say variable A is an integer. Simple. Store its binary 8 bit value. Letâs say variable B is an array. Well it could be of a varied length so I need some way to tell the program when itâs reading the file that the data for this variable starts here and ends here. I canât use any of the 256 combinations of 8 bits because they all represent numbers that the value Iâm trying to store could be.\n\n**So how can I mark the beginning and end of certain pieces of data in bytes?** Iâm sure this is a very basic computer science problem but Iâm not proficient enough in Google-fu to find it online.",

        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI want to seriously study Full Stack Software Engineering from now on. I have a tech job that covers many things but does not have a clear focus on a certain area, which's making me anxious becuase the 'stack' I learned from this job is only relevant... in that job... I have some knowledge playing around with HTML, CSS and JS (Being a lazy guy, I never formally studied any of them, but I kinda learned by looking, testing and asking what would happen if I do X instead of Y. I'd say I am somewhere between jr and mid).\n\nBut now I wanted to really study to the point I master Front and Back End, and have skills that will suit for any company. \n\nI never liked watching those video classes - I prefer to read, understand and put into practice.   \n  \nSo, I've found this site **The Odin Project** and wanted to know if putting all my efforts into studying through all the sections and lectures is worth it? I know it'll take time (possibly an entire year) but this anxiety of having a 'useless stack' that I got from this job is killing me. I no longer want to be in this position.\n\n  \nThanks everyone who spared a few minutes to comment here ð",

        "content": "Hey, Iâm a 2nd year Compurer Science student and my studies already take up a ton of time and energy. Most of my day is basically just me sitting behind my laptop grinding through uni work so I can keep my grades up.\n\nAt the same time, I also have the ambition to build my own projects, either to make money from programming or at least to create tools that are genuinely useful to me. The problem is I havenât even managed to start a project yet. I struggle with discipline and time. After a full day of studying, my brain just feels fried, and at that point I usually need to do something physical instead. Iâm pretty active and I love sports, so I go to MMA once a week and try to squeeze in short workouts on other days. Honestly, without sports Iâd probably go crazy.\n\nAnother factor is that I still live at home. My family expects me to spend a lot of time with them, helping out aroud the hosue, hanging with my sibling, etc. I feel guilty if I ignore them, so usually when I get back from uni I end up just chilling in the living room instead of working on a personal project. On top of that, my little brother has been sick for a few years and canât really leave the house, so he needs more of my time and energy too. I hope he gets better soon, since that would have a good impact on both our lives.\n\nIâm the type of person who really likes having structure and a routine, so part of me feels like moving out nearby could help me manage my time better. But then that also makes me feel guilty for âleavingâ my family.\n\nMeanwhile, one of my classmates (and a good friend) has the same ambitions as me, but his routine is very different. After studying all day, he takes break at home, then spends the rest of the evening grinding on a personal project until he goes to bed. He basically lives on his own, doesnât care much for sports, and spends almost all his time in front of a screen. I can see it working for him, heâs making progress and hitting his goals,  but I also suspect itâs taking a toll on his health. Still, I canât help but compare myself to him and admire his discipline.\n\nSorry for the info dump, but I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone has advice on how to balance studies, family, health, and personal projects, Iâd really appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if people got drop some project ideas or just routes i can take. I only looked into automating stuff in my live. But maybe there are far more intersting usefull and lucrative ideas (altho i doubt people would tell this one if they know it :))",

        "content": "Hey everyone, Iâm struggling to enjoy studying. Iâm naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even âharderâ coding problems, the process itself feels painful.\n\nEven when I break tasks into small problems, if I canât solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like Iâm running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isnât as satisfying as it used to be.\n\nThis year in school doesnât help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. Iâve even stopped working on projects because the thought âI must prepare for the examsâ hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isnât making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I donât have a choice I canât go to university if I donât pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soon\nRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.\n\nI might be spiraling \n\nMy question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isnât naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost \n\nI really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",

I have found though, if I repeat and focus enough on an action I can do it in my sleep. Iâm not working at the moment because of it, but I desperately want to. The thing is I did a degree over 20 yrs ago, failed miserably (due to a mixture of family bereavement and wrong course) so I can not get a student loan.\n\nI need a home based job, but not phone or customer based. I decided to try a hand in software development.\n\nIâm not artistic so web design is probably out unless some one comes up with the design and I code it lol so back end is probably where I need to focus (although no clue where to start with that).\n\nIâve started doing freecodecamp which is going good so far. I know itâll get harder. Also I started from the beginning so web design, just to ease me in. \n\nMost if not all boot camps arenât accredited. Although I did find one that was, but wanted Â£7000+ for 16 weeks for full stack and I can no way afford it.\n\nWhat Iâm asking is there any point in going through free resources if at the end of learning I still need to do a degree to get a job. Iâve looked at a lot of job sites, and itâs mainly degrees they want. \n\n \n\n",

        "content": "Hey guys, Iâm 18 and I just got into an engineering school here in Morocco. I donât know anything about coding or software engineering yet but Iâm thinking of going for Computer Science as my major. I kinda feel like itâs the best option for me but Iâm also not 100% sure.\n\nI keep hearing people say stuff like âAI is gonna take all our jobs,â and some people seem scared of going into CS because of that. But honestly I feel like this is the best time to do it, since everyone else is scared and maybe leaving space for me to get a job later.\n\nRight now Iâm in what they call âpreparatory years,â which is mostly math and physics for two years (calculus, analysis, linear algebra, thermodynamics, electrostatics, organic chemistry, all that stuff). After that, Iâll choose my major, probably CS unless something changes.\n\nMy plan is to start self-teaching programming and development during these two years so by the time I actually get into CS Iâm not a total beginner. I want to become good enough at coding and development by the end of the 5 years to freelance whenever I want and build some kind of financial freedom, so Iâm not stuck depending on a job forever.\n\nI know itâs a big goal and Iâm starting with zero experience in coding but Iâm serious about making it work.\n\nHereâs what Iâm worried about:\n\n\\* Is it actually possible to become really good at coding from zero in 5 years? Like good enough to freelance or get decent jobs?\n\n\\* Should I be scared about AI taking all the software jobs?\n\n\\* How safe is CS compared to other majors like mechanical or electrical engineering?\n\n\\* What should I be doing during these two prep years to prepare myself ? Like put yourself in my shoes for a second please.\n\nSorry for the long post but I wanted to say everything thatâs on my mind. Iâd really appreciate honest advice, especially from anyone whoâs been through this or is ahead of me.\n\n",

I have around 2 years of professional experience (plus personal projects), and my degree is in Industrial Engineering, not CS, unfortunately.\n\nIâm currently exploring job opportunities in the EU and I live in Turkey as a EU citizen. From what Iâve seen, Go related roles are quite limited and often target senior/lead engineers (likely for teams migrating to Go). Because of this, Iâm considering shifting to Java for backend work, since it seems to have a much broader job market.\n\nAt the same time, Iâm also tempted by C++. There arenât many developers specializing in low-level coding, and I feel that makes it a valuable skill in the long run. On top of that, I really enjoy thinking about systems, hardware, and OS-level concepts (not recommend assembly :) ), though I have very limited knowledge since I donât come from a CS background. This makes me wonder if transitioning to C++ would be worth compared to Java.\n\nIâd love to hear your thoughts and experiences, whether itâs about job market trends, learning paths, or the trade-offs between going deeper into Go, switching to Java, or investing in C++.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and youâre trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):\n\n1. Solves the userâs problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).\n2. Isnât overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.\n3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.\n\nContext: Iâm a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. Iâve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.\n\nQuestions I struggle with repeatedly:\n\n1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see whatâs hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\n**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry Iâm making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly). Or is this trial-and-error method the only way to learn?",

        "content": "Firstly, I'm tired of endlessly reading books/tutorials on languages. I switched three resources for C++. The last one was the most recommended - C++ primer, 5th edition (or whatever edition covers C++11). After authors told me about auto and decltype() in SECOND chapter, I dropped it, because... No. Just no. Why would they teach me this, if they even couldn't provide me some real-world examples of its usage? The worst thing is that I know C++'s basics, so reading any book on C++ becomes mostly a torment for me. And yet I can't just \"skip to the interesting part\", because I never know what I'm gonna miss unless I read that. :) And the most important: I'm just tired of doing nothing. Yeah, there are these little exercises in each chapter, but I wanna learn programming to make software, not to accomplish those exercises. That means, I would like to start building something as soon as possible.\n\nI have some experience in C, C++, C#, Python. The last language I used was python. Python did let me start building as soon as possible (thanks to python's docs and previous experience in C-languages). I mostly liked it, but I'm pretty sure that I don't wanna tie my life to it. I tried building a text-only roguelike with it, but I struggled with the structure. Not that I'm saying this is python's fault, just sharing what I made so far with it. I made the main game loop (fight system, basically) and classes of characters (warrior, mage, etc). Each character has max health, max mana, level, some spells and growths of health and mana with each level (like growths of attributes in DoTA 2). Stopped and decided to rewrite the whole thing, because it felt like the structure got too messy. The largest barrier in making it is import cycles existence and relations between classes.  \n\nAlso I had to work on C# for two weeks. I made a GUI calculator with it, which uses the worst but (it seems) working algorithm of evaluation. C# let me start building right away too, thanks to my previous C++ knowledge. I also found Microsoft docs really helpful. \n\nI have ~~experience~~ knowledge of old C++, which is compatible with C (raw pointers, C-strings, C-arrays, etc), and knowledge of just a few things that comes only with C++, like vectors/stacks/queues and classes (basics of all of them).\n\nFinally, I would like to provide my vision on languages that I'm interested in OR have ever tried. Note that I don't consider web at all (and even electron or whatever way to use JS for software developing). I'm not interested in it.\n\nC++: seems too low-level to just let me start building things, plus it has terrible ecosystem with all of these build systems, their generators (CMake, Meson) and unpleasant ways to get 3rd party libraries.\n\nRust: seems too low-level to just let me start building things. It does have better ecosystem, but I guess there are just no resources on it for newbies like me.\n\nC#: tied to windows... Not that I hate it, but coding on windows just feels wrong, plus I've never found something better than bare GNU Emacs when it comes to text editors, but it works fine only on native linux setup. There is .NET SDK for Linux, but... I'm not sure. I sort of can't believe that it's actually good and is being used in production, knowing what Linux to Microsoft is.\n\nJava: ...Not sure when it comes to future... I heard that there are no new projects on Java...\n\nPython: I don't see myself using it, knowing where it's being used mostly (I would like to make standalone software). Also, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be much harder to find a job because of how popular Python is.\n\nI ask you to give your views on what I should and shouldn't do and your views on the languages I listed above. Thank you!",

I am aware of commitment and determination but I also feel stressed whenever I try to code for myself or solve the problems (Most of my assignments are typically due in three days. My professor assign us lab for us to work on our own on Thursdays.). I am afraid of failing Computer science and the professor.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey r/learnprogramming,\n\nI've been using Rust for a while and recently finished a project that involved some interesting challenges I thought would be valuable to share, especially for those curious about using Rust with other languages.\n\n\n\n# ## The Goal\n\n\n\nIn my field (bioinformatics), there's a powerful C++ tool called `odgi` for working with complex DNA data. I wanted to use its features inside a Rust program to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency, which meant building a bridge between the two languages.\n\n\n\n# ## The Learning Journey & Key Challenges\n\n\n\nEven with experience, this project presented some great learning opportunities:\n\n1. **Tackling FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** The core of the project was making Rust and C++ talk to each other. I used the `cxx` crate, which is a fantastic tool for generating safe bindings. It was a deep dive into how to manage data and function calls across the language boundary, which is a common task in systems programming.\n2. **Designing a \"Safe\" API:** A key principle in Rust is memory safety. A big part of the design work was creating a public API that completely hides the `unsafe` FFI calls. This ensures anyone using my library can write 100% safe Rust code, a rewarding design challenge.\n3. **Complex Build Scripts:** I had to write a [`build.rs`](http://build.rs) script to compile the entire C++ `odgi` library from source before building the Rust code. It's a good reminder of how complex real-world build pipelines can get when you're integrating different ecosystems.\n\n\n\n# ## The Outcome\n\n\n\nThe result is a library (`odgi-ffi`) that other Rust developers in my field can now use as a solid foundation for their own tools.\n\n\n\n# ## Key Takeaways\n\n\n\n* **Real-world problems push your skills:** Integrating existing, complex libraries is a great way to move beyond language basics.\n* **Modern tooling makes hard problems accessible:** FFI used to be a very manual and error-prone process. Crates like `cxx` make it significantly more manageable and safe.\n\nI just wanted to share the experience in case it's helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, or about using Rust and C++ together.",

        "content": "Heyo. I haven't been coding very long, I know python and I've only just started learning Java. But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThis is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\n\n\\---\n\nIf current\\_frame == 1: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_1 on screen\n\nif current\\_frame ==2: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_2 on screen\n\n\\---\n\netc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.\n\nI'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.\n\nThis may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals. Thanks even if this is stupid!!",

It can be anything from a website or app to a game or even a hardware-based project like a robotic arm.\n\nOriginally, I had a cool idea, but our teacher just dropped a new requirement: the project has to be either educational or environmental. Last year's students made a fitness app or a horror game, so this is a bit of a change.\n\nI'm looking for some fresh and interesting ideas that fit this new theme. I enjoy both programming and hardware. I also have skills in Blender and Unreal Engine, so I can work with 3D graphics and game development.\n\nDo you have any ideas that blend technology with education or the environment? Maybe something that helps people learn to code in a fun way, or a project that monitors and helps reduce a household's energy consumption? Maybe something interactive in 3D? I'm open to all ideas, even if they are outside my comfort zone.",

The problem is that if I had to rebuild them from scratch without AI help, Iâm not confident I could do it.\n\nWhatâs the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\n\nUltimately, I want to understand enough Python to use tools like Codex effectively, though I might take things further if I end up really enjoying it.\n\nThanks!\n",

But the real outcome for me was how much I learned while building it.\n\nHere are a few screenshots and a link if anyoneâs curious:\n\nFind here : [https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shared/id6748949959](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shared/id6748949959)\n\nIâm still improving it and would be glad to hear any feedback, but mainly I wanted to share how working on a concrete project really accelerated my learning compared to just reading docs or watching tutorials.",

The big companies are evenmoreh hell bent on RTO because they know they'll always have people willing to interview for them. \n\nIt's similar to how companies give very low hikes and risk employees leaving them. Sure they make a loss on the people who switch but they bet on most people *not* switching than switching. \n\nThis plan gets foiled when employees are at home and can easily interview at their homes. \n\nEdit: Of course people switch even with wfo but it's much harder. Also it's a factor, not the sole reason. Getting people to resign on their own, pre signed leases, managers just being picky are reasons too. ",

I just get my work, do it, and get my weekly paycheck that is significantly higher than my full time pay was, even accounting for paying for the insurance I get through the firm. Nobody cares when I clock in and out, as long as I get my work done. There's no less job security than there was at my full time roles where rounds of layoffs would come every year at least.\n\nThis is the only job I've ever had where I am not constantly bombarded with a bunch of \"extracurricular\" bullshit that eats away at my soul and burns me out.\n\nOh yeah, perhaps most importantly: **I got the job after two interviews: a phone screen with HR and a technical discussion with my team, with no leetcode or DSA interrogation rounds.** Just a discussion of my projects and experience. \n\nI have friends who have been doing this for years and they have similar experiences to me. I feel dumb for not having tried it sooner, because I bought into the idea that it was \"lesser\" or was afraid I wouldn't have good enough health insurance.\n\nAnyway, YMMV, but just wanted to provide a counterbalance to the people who run down contract work.

The whole process felt like the company had unreasonable expectations, no respect for work-life balance, and zero transparency about pay.\n\nTLDR: Startup wanted a founding engineer to work 72 hours a week, refused to talk pay until pressed, then reluctantly said 150k to 220k.\n\nAre companies in this market seriously expecting crazy hours while refusing to talk pay until the very end?",

Thereâs just too many complicated parts and it is difficult to map out how to get started (I.e. what types of tooling I would need, what objects Iâd need, how they will interact etc). I just feel completely overwhelmed when thinking of a project and as a result never actually get to it or abandon it. Any suggestions?",

What really matters for hiring is personality because the company can train you in the rest.\n\nHonestly, that crushed me for a while. I lost passion for the technical side of the craft because it felt like no matter how much I built up my skills, it wouldnât be valued if I didnât also figure out how to communicate better or improve my personality.\n\nDoes anyone else feel discouraged by this? Iâd really like to hear your thoughts.\n\nAnd when you think about it, being both technically advanced and socially skilled is actually an extremely rare and difficult combination. A good example is in the Netflix film Gran Turismo.

Iâve been working here for about a month and a half and its been pretty great; the work-life-balance is nice and the culture so far is chill. My team is developing a brand new product for the company which is pretty exciting, but that also means thereâs risks.\nThe product could flop, maybe the culture shifts once its released and we are supporting client, or maybe the product gets cancelled, i get laid-off, and my resume shows me working on some zero impact project. The work is pure Java with some Vertx.\n\nA recruiter reached out to me about a role i was previously rejected on. Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:\n130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)\nThe catch is itâs 4x a week in office and currently a 30-45 minute commute to the most touristy part of the city. The company had a recent round of layoffs as well so im not sure if itâs really the much more stable apart from the product being more mature.\n\nObviously, iâd feel bad leaving a company within a few months especially one that i really like, but is it dumb to pass up such a pay raise?\n\nAny advice or additional considerations is welcome.",

You see it everywhere from âDay in the Lifeâ YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nDonât get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isnât true.\n\nThere are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\n* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.\n* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.\n* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.\n* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.\n* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always âhigh salaryâ in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.\n\nI think tech gets the spotlight partly because\n\n1. Itâs more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people âgetâ what a software engineer does\n2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those âDay in the Lifeâ vlogs\n\nMeanwhile, most law firms or finance offices arenât putting out lifestyle videos showing their perks\n\nCurious what others think: is it just the marketing or social media presence, or is there something unique about tech culture that makes people talk about salaries and perks more than other fields?",

Interviews have rarely anything to do with what you do on the job. Thanks to all the endless technology programmers have to make up every year, good luck keeping up with everything. Also, look forward to 3-5 rounds of BS each time. Good luck finding the time to do this if you have a job you hate. I guess good luck if you run out of days to use for interviews.

I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),\n\nThis kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the \"low-level\", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.\n\nNow I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.\n\nI struggle to use git lol\n\nCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusing\n\nI struggle with database stuff\n\nI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own \"OOP\" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.\n\nGet fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shit\n\nAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool \"high level\" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.\n\nIt's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.\n\nNone of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).\n\nNone of these things are \"software\" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).\n\nTo be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.\n\nAny insights or advice is much appreciated.",

        "content": "I joined my big tech company about 4 months ago. Prior to this, I was at a very chill company making lower than the average swe in my city but also had quite a bit of free time. I would always work on side projects and was always down to jump on random startup ideas with good friends where I would only handle the tech stuff. I never really did this stuff to make money (of course I always hoped that it would pay off each time) but simply for the love of the game. I genuinely think me building all these websites in the past taught me a lot and turned me into a really good engineer. Now, I'm in your typical big tech company making 250k.\n\nThe other day, a friend reached out with an idea for a tool. The idea makes sense to me and doesn't sound too difficult to build. He also has a pipeline to market it and already some validation so I would only have to handle the tech stuff so I immediately told him I'm down.\n\nHowever thinking about it after, I'm wondering if it's the smartest thing to do. I like to think that I'm good at what I do so even at work I only work 8h and it's not too bad but now that I'm making plenty of money, I'm not sure if I want to spend time and effort on trying to build random things.\n\nDo you guys think it's worth it? On one hand, there's still a chance it can end up succeeding and I also continue to learn more things but on the other hand, should I continue to spend my time and effort on these side projects rather than pour it all into my job?\n\nAdvice is appreciated!",

Nobody really cares whether you are working from the office or from home.\n\nBecause I felt I had started a little late, I set clear goals for myself and committed to following them with full focus. The company provides resources for learning, so I used every single one of them. On top of that I bought my own courses, set up AWS accounts, and practiced daily. I even had an old server lying around at home. I spun it up with Ubuntu and started building a homelab on weekends.\n\nExcited about my progress, I shared everything with my boss, hoping for feedback and guidance. Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as âtoo ambitiousâ and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.\n\nAt first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.\n\nMy plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.\n\nWhat I have realized is that ambition makes some people uncomfortable, but it also attracts the right kind of people who genuinely want to see you succeed. I am grateful that I found one of those people here.\n\nEdit: I have been axed. Received email. I had just put my son to school in August. :)",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nSome background: my mom has been dealing with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my momâs cancer spread again last month. Iâve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.\n\nIâm a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. Itâs not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but Iâve been there over a year and itâs remote so I can visit my mom and qualify for FMLA.\n\nA few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. Itâs also remote, and I wouldnât get FMLA if I needed it. \n\nI am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. Itâs all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. Iâm very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that Iâve squandered this opportunity.\n\nI had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, Iâm afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But Iâm not. \n\nIâm afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, Iâll end up in a situation where Iâll get fired or theyâll find out Iâm not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I canât code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just canât now.\n\nI donât know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I donât even want to try to take the assessment because Iâm so overwhelmed, Iâm behind at my current job and donât have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least Iâm comfortable though.\n\nI guess Iâm just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter. How can I withdrawal in a way that could potentially leave the door open for future opportunities?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?\n\nFrustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my teamâs effectiveness.\n\nQA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and thereâs no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each otherâs code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesnât even work, or it doesnât do what they think itâs doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors donât seem to care even when I bring it up to them.\n\nPlanning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in âto-doâ. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they donât see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what Iâm talking about because âit always works out anywayâ (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain Iâm always prolonging simple tickets.\n\nArchitecture: Thereâs no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesnât even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing theyâre blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out âhey, this doesnât look like itâs going to do what it seems like youâre asking forâ during sprint planning. They claim Iâm worrying too much about edge cases.\n\nFor example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they donât know any better. Theyâll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so Iâm stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and âthinking my way is the only wayâ.\n\nIâve been trying to affect change, but itâs above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when Iâm proven right and end up fixing things, itâs generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. Iâm also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but itâs led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks weâre doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. Iâll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of âno itâs notâ or âprove itââ¦ so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told âstop being too technicalâ. Basically they donât trust me when I tell them something is problematic, and then still donât understand when I show the code causing the issue. Itâs a no-win situation.\n\n\n1:1 with the tech lead who said basically âwe donât need to worry about good principles because we can rewrite the whole app in a month if we really had to, just chill out and stop worrying, the company isnât really affected.â I disagree wholeheartedly, I think our performance has the ability to kill the company by destroying our customerâs trust from the sheer amount of bugs and misrepresented data in the product.",

        "content": "Lots of little details here so bear with me. \n\n\nTech lead, 13 YOE, F500, WFH 95% of the time. Only need to go into the office for select VIP meetings. \n\n\nI am 9 weeks into \"maternity leave\" (aka 6 weeks to heal from major abdominal surgery plus 6 weeks unpaid leave) and I am getting anxiety about the end of it looming - mostly about dropping off my baby into daycare. First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.\n\n\nThis part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).\n\n\nI have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.\n\n\nAn additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a \"solution architect\" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal. \n\n\nSo I guess my questions are... Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? Am I crazy for contemplating how I can make it work? Any suggestions or advice in general? ",

Is this another interview, weeks after I already interviewed and accepted their offer? I wonder if they want to bomb me so they can switch the position to someone else. Why talk technical stuff with me more than a month after you gave me an offer which I accepted?\n\n**Edit**: The interview went well, and they said as much. It was kind of like a repeat of the previous inerview, I thought. I asked them about it, asked what brought this about given I already accepted the offer weeks ago. They said that it's a \"pipeline\" thing, I didn't quite follow. Something about how at that time they were gearing up for the recompete, and how we all have background checks and security clerance to be done, and basically that the purpose of this was, now that we're approaching the work for real, the get a feel for precisely where I should be on this large team. Honestly, that still doesn't quite make sense to me, because as I said this interview was almost a repeat of the last one. Why not talk to those interviewers and ask them where they think I should go? Regardless, judging from their response we should be good to go. So in short, I think it's just government contracting weirdness, I don't think they wanted to bump me off or anything like that.",

I flagged this to the team lead to no avail, then talked to the CeO directly, he gave him another chance, but nothing changed. Now the CEO wants to replace him.\n\nHereâs my thought:\nWe donât actually need another âteam lead.â We already handle PRs and code reviews internally. What we really need is proper planning, prioritization, and alignment, in other words, a technical project manager. Iâve already been doing parts of this informally, and I want to propose stepping into that role officially. Itâd be a chance for me to grow, get promoted, and make sure the project actually delivers.\n\nQuestion is , with only 2 yearsâ experience, do you think itâs too soon to pitch myself for this?

        "content": "Iâve been working at an agency that supports a big telecom company for about 4 years. I started as a junior SWE building automation scripts and batch jobs for customer provisioning and order management flows. I liked the WLB since I worked from home most days and the hours were manageable.\n\nLast year the project I was working on ended, and I was moved into an incident manager role in the IT department of a smaller subsidiary of the company. Itâs been rough and honestly taking a toll on my mental health. Most days are just nonstop incident calls with no coding to brush up on my skills. The environment is toxic and draining with constant cost cutting, shifting expectations, and heavy micromanagement from leadership. I have terrible hours and Iâm expected to be on-call on weekends. Since I joined, two people were let go and now there are only three of us handling even more responsibilities. On top of that, I didnât get a raise this year because I switched teams. My salary was above average for my area and experience, but not getting a raise really discouraged me. It's obvious they're taking advantage of the tough job market.\n\nIâve been in my current role almost a year now and Iâm ready to jump ship. Iâve been applying to jobs on and off (nearly 200) but only got one interview from a random recruiter on LinkedIn. Itâs frustrating since I have 3 YoE as a dev and thought that would at least give me an edge. My old manager said transferring to another role internally would be tricky without my current teamâs support.\n\nI know I got lucky during the 2021 hiring craze but Iâm wondering if Iâm cooked now. I would consider myself an average programmer with knowledge of basic fundamentals, I do leetcode occasionally but I donât really have passion projects outside of work. Should I focus on side projects, certifications, start working on building my network, or maybe pivot into something like cybersecurity or data engineering? Iâve considered pursuing a masterâs in AI/ML. Iâd love some advice on what the smartest next steps might be.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello, \n\nI realize I might get clowned for asking this, but I do genuinely think hearing peoples' perspectives will help me.\n\nI have been working as a Software Engineer at a relatively large (for a startup) startup for 3 years now (was 22 then, am 25 now). I work on pretty low-levelled stuff with C, like Linux kernel stuff, network stuff, etc. I started as an intern right out of college making $25 an hour, but gradually moved up each year to $140,000 per year which I make now.\n\nMy team is really chill overall, and I am good friends with a good-sized portion of the team members. I do think that I have learned a lot already throughout my \\~3 years at my current role, but I know I could still learn more here if I stayed. But it would have to come from myself searching out new opportunities actively within the organization, as the work I have been getting has been kind of the same for a while, and I do feel kind of monotonous at times. However, I also fault myself for not being more proactive and asking my boss for more interesting work, I realize I've been kind of just doing whatever they needed me to do, without advocating to be given what I think would be most interesting/ best for my learning. Lastly I should mention that I do lots of work with an overseas team so sometimes I have to do late night meetings and stuff which is not exactly preferable (though I'm sure that's not necessarily something that is avoidable, and might happen at any other job).\n\nThe situation I am in is, I have just received an offer from AWS as an SDE II, at around \\~$330,000 total compensation. I wasn't really seeking it out, I just got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, and thought I'd give it a shot and see how the interview process went. And then, yeah I just kind of Forrest Gump'd to an offer. So yeah it all kind of happened sort of fast for me, so I have mixed emotions. Obviously, the money is more (though the startup I work at might get acquired, I think we do have potential offers etc., but I am not entirely sure as the management hasn't directly told us). But I am trying to decide what is best for my career. While I love my current team, I do think that I could gain a lot from expanding my horizons. And working at Amazon might also allow me to open new doors. The team I was offered to join is pretty similar to what I am doing now (systems level and network stuff). But I also would potentially have more opportunities to move around within the organization (eventually) and try new things, which is definitely not really possible with my current company. Also I think I might want to try living somewhere else some day (been in the Bay Area really my whole life) and obviously it might be easier to do that if I had other offices at my company I could go to (not really an option at my current company).\n\n  \nSo I guess I just want to hear what people would do in my shoes, it is surprisingly a little difficult to decide. I do think I know what most of you are going to say but I just thought it would be good to seek the guidance of the forefathers/foremothers, the pioneers who have walked this path before me.

        "content": "I'm posting for a friend since they don't have enough karma to post here:\n\nI graduated in recent years and secured a software engineer job a couple months after graduation doing standard dev work in the traditional way (no AI). Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.\n\nI've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.\n\nIâm concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.\n\nIn the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, Iâm concerned that my skills will not have grown here. Iâve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.\n\nStill being very early in my career, Iâm wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.\n\nI personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone whoâs inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.\n\nSo regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.\n\nAre there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?\n\n**\\*UPDATE/EDIT\\***\n\nPerhaps \"AI Vibe Coding\" was the wrong term, even though my job title is still Software Engineer, my role is more like \"Prompt Engineer\".\n\nI don't want to give too much details, but my team is currently coming up with and providing prompts for other teams to use in certain AI tools to expedite their workflows. We have also been training them on communication with the AI tools being used, basically \"AI Evangelists/Crusaders\" at this point.\n\nI haven't had the chance to write any code, and future projects are to create more prompts to feed these AI agents so they can automate more workflows. This process doesn't involve me ever having to delve deep into a codebase or understand an actual product. I'm basically working on just prompts.",

        "content": "I'm a web dev with over 10 years experience in a number of different languages, when jobs changed so did tech stack; I can give a little context to each one. \n\nC/C++: my weakest of the languages used it professionally for 8 months on a legacy backend system with many layers of contractor crap. It was my first job out of college, and it was hard I was over my head and lost in the sauce. I would say I know this language 1/10  \n  \nJava: I've worked with this on and off for a number of years, ironically always with spring framework, know it decently well in terms of usage, would need to brush up on multithreading/concurrency, have used SpringThreadExecutor in the past for big batch jobs.  I would say I know this language 8/10\n\nGolang: I've used this on and off too but not as much or as deeply as Java usually in a microservice context and didn't do any concurrent programming with it but does look a lot nice to work with in that context than the others. It's been sometime since I used this.  I would say I know this language 5/10\n\nPHP: I used this for a couple of years as old job had a monolith, I actually didn't mind this language and was really easy to pick up, no concurrency or like just a straight crud app with a LAMP stack. I would say I know this language 5/10\n\nPython: Used for some scripts, Advent of Code and leetcode job interview questions fun way to use and nice that its closest to pseudo code yeah spacing can be annoying but overall, I liked it. I would say I know this language 5 maybe 6/10\n\nJavaScript: Used it for a couple of years from what i remember it was promise chain hell, have done some stuff with it recently on a full stack node.js app but it has so much crap on top I am not a fan, I tend to almost write Java like code in Javascript. I would say I know this language 3/10\n\n  \nI really want to get a deeper knowledge of one of these languages and make it my main one, I feel almost a tie between C/Python/Golang.   \n  \nC for just sheer simplicity I'm sure it will be segfaults out the ass in the beginning but would be fun to get that low level and just be me talking to the computer's memory, then again it may break me. Could open opportunities for hardware or os programming.\n\nPython I feel fast and free with this language, just having to remember at times when func params are copied etc. Fast to work with but many others have called it slow, also nice that it's the default language of AI so very versatile.  \n  \nGolang easier use of pointers and mem management, simplified concurrency programming, I haven't done much beyond crud so hard to know just how efficient this language could be if I go a little deeper. Also seems that lots of jobs openings.\n\nSorry if this post is a little rambley I'm just out of work and wanting to enjoy programming again for fun, so just thinking aloud. If you made it this far thank you would love to hear your opinions/takes and even fun projects within each language?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They all in the end ask how I feel, and to be honest I donât know how to feel about it, almost like Iâm speechless or something.

Probably it's a controversial topic, but I really believe that AIs will change the world as the Internet did 35~ years ago, and I'd like to be one of those who'll build this world one way or another.\n\nAnyway, the question is, what skills should I develop now to start my career in AI/ML? I have a quite decent (at least in my country it's considered decent, but not some really high level) IT background with several years of system administration and a software engineer college degree (technically I can code, but my job has never required something more serious than Python/Bash QoL scripts, so my coding skills are probably somewhere around junior), but for some reason I feel like except the general basics it does not apply to LLMs/AI. I mean... theoretically I could get a job where I'd have to develop a mobile/desktop app that is built around AI or something like that, but it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something that is directly related to AIs, even if it's just a prompt engineering role. ",

        "author": "Mislavoo7",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**TL;DR:** Iâve worked \\~9 years in the same IT company (mostly backend, some frontend + DevOps). My salary is low (\\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \\~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.\n\nThe challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so itâs hard to compare my experience with \"standard\" projects. Thatâs why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.\n\n# What I built\n\nI made two projects:\n\n* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.\n* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.\n\n# The idea\n\nUsers can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.\n\nI intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a \"real\" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.\n\n# What I worked with\n\n**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.\n\n* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).\n* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).\n* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.\n* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).\n\n**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**\n\nUsers can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.\n\n* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).\n* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (â¬/$), theme (light/dark).\n* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.\n\n**DevOps**\n\nI Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.\n\n**Content**\n\nI wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.\n\n# Code & live apps\n\nGitHub repo for Rails app: [Sparenzi Web](https://sparenzi.eu/) and [Repo](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenziweb/tree/master)\n\n(There are few commits because I developed in a private GitLab repo and only published the final version here)\n\nGitHub repo for React Native app: [Sparenzi](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenzi)\n\n# What I'd love to know\n\n* How would you rate my project execution? (both technically and as a portfolio piece)\n* What should I improve before showing this to recruiters / potential employers?\n* Based on what Iâve shown here, should I present myself as junior, mid, or senior developer?\n* Iâm considering taking on freelance jobs in the \\~$20/h range (about 20h/week alongside my current job). Is this realistic, or should I ask for more/less per hour and more/less hours per week?\n\nAny honest feedback is super welcome â Iâm trying to figure out my real position on the market so I can plan my next steps.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Has anyone else had job hopping imposed on them by employers? I'm jobless again and I've recently received feedback from what I suspect is an automated system that one of the things they prioritize is tenure. I think as I approach 8 years in, advance in my career, and seek more senior roles, this is going to become problematic.\n\nMy history looks like this:\n\n* Job 1 left after 1 year 6 months\n* Job 2 left after 1 year 7 months\n* Job 3 laid off after 1 year 10 months\n* Job 4 laid off after 1 year\n* Job 5 laid off after 1 year 3 months\n\nJob 3 was Twitter. I would have stayed there indefinitely if it hadn't become a train wreck and I and everyone I knew was let go. Since then each job has been a place I enjoyed but my employer makes the decision for me that me and many others can no longer work there.\n\nOn one hand I empathize with the desire for a candidate with longer tenure, but it's starting to feel rigged. I generally get good feedback from my managers and then I'm blindsided by what I assume are decisions made above them. It's a bit slow-going finding a new job after my most recent layoff and I'm wondering how much this might be holding me back. In addition to feeling quite jaded at this point, it feels rigged in the sense the industry has decided that employees are easily disposable and long term hiring decisions are not important, but they also want heavily tenured and battle-hardened engineers.\n\nI tend to get significantly above-average pay packages at these places compared to the industry median (but not necessarily compared to the company) and they have all been remote roles, so I wonder if that puts a target on my back, i.e., \"high-risk high-reward,\" but the last two companies aren't what I'd call \"big tech\". Against my better judgement I've included \"company-wide layoffs\" next to my last three roles because I worry employers might balk otherwise, but I wonder if there's anything else to be done in my situation, and what this all has cost me.",

        "content": "Iâm currently a Node.js developer, and Iâve been seeing posts suggesting that if I want to land serious enterprise jobs, I should switch to either Java or .NET depending on regional demand and Node.js seems to be used mostly in startups and small to mid-sized businesses. But letâs say I decide to stick with Node.jsâhow much growth can I realistically expect? Will I hit a ceiling faster compared to other stacks, or are the specific stacks less important and companies care more about core concepts than the language itself? Iâm stuck. ",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI was reached out by a manager at Amazon wishing to extend a 6 months full time contract. Since, I did a similar work in the past, I was inclined to accept and the rate was good. However, when I received an email from Populus Group (PG, the contractor), the billing rate is 15% less that what I was quoted. I understand that PG takes their cut but 2 years ago, it was only 7% and I didn't bother much.\n\nDo you all know if I can negotiate this with PG or if the manager can pull some strings via HR or this is the new standard?\n\nNo PTO, there are some health insurance options to opt in but I won't need them.\n\n  \nTIA",
